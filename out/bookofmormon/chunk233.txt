that is the founder of peace yea even the lord who has redeemed his people yea him who has granted salvation unto his people for were it not for the redemption which he hath made for his people which was prepared from the foundation of the world i say unto you were it not for this all mankind must have perished but behold the bands of death shall be broken and the son reigneth and hath power over the dead therefore he bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead and there cometh a resurrection even a first resurrection yea even a resurrection of those that have been and who are and who shall be even until the resurrection of christ for so shall he be called and now the resurrection of all the prophets and all those that have believed in their words or all those that have kept the commandments of god shall come forth in the first resurrection therefore they are the first resurrection they are raised to dwell with god who has redeemed them thus they have eternal life through christ who has broken the bands of death and these are those who have part in the first resurrection and these are they that have died before christ came in their ignorance not having salvation declared unto them and thus the lord bringeth about the restoration of these and they have a part in the first resurrection or have eternal life being redeemed by the lord and little children also have eternal life but behold and fear and tremble before god for ye ought to tremble for the lord redeemeth none such that rebel against him and die in their sins yea even all those that have perished in their sins ever since the world began that have wilfully rebelled against god that have known the commandments of god and would not keep them these are they that have no part in the first resurrection therefore ought ye not to tremble for salvation cometh to none such for the lord hath redeemed none such yea neither can the lord redeem such for he cannot deny himself for he cannot deny
