them swarms of bees and all manner of that which was upon the face of the land seeds of every kind and it came to pass that when they had come down into the valley of nimrod the lord came down and talked with the brother of jared and he was in a cloud and the brother of jared saw him not and it came to pass that the lord commanded them that they should go forth into the wilderness yea into that quarter where there never had man been and it came to pass that the lord did go before them and did talk with them as he stood in a cloud and gave directions whither they should travel and it came to pass that they did travel in the wilderness and did build barges in which they did cross many waters being directed continually by the hand of the lord and the lord would not suffer that they should stop beyond the sea in the wilderness but he would that they should come forth even unto the land of promise which was choice above all other lands which the lord god had preserved for a righteous people and he had sworn in his wrath unto the brother of jared that whoso should possess this land of promise from that time henceforth and forever should serve him the true and only god or they should be swept off when the fulness of his wrath should come upon them and now we can behold the decrees of god concerning this land that it is a land of promise and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall serve god or they shall be swept off when the fulness of his wrath shall come upon them and the fulness of his wrath cometh upon them when they are ripened in iniquity for behold this is a land which is choice above all other lands wherefore he that doth possess it shall serve god or shall be swept off for it is the everlasting decree of god and it is not until the fulness of iniquity among the children of the land that they are swept off
