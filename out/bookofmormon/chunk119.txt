spoil and to take the prey and to tread them down like the mire of the streets howbeit he meaneth not so neither doth his heart think so but in his heart it is to destroy and cut off nations not a few for he saith are not my princes altogether kings is not calno as carchemish is not hamath as arpad is not samaria as damascus as my hand hath founded the kingdoms of the idols and whose graven images did excel them of jerusalem and of samaria shall i not as i have done unto samaria and her idols so do to jerusalem and to her idols wherefore it shall come to pass that when the lord hath performed his whole work upon mount zion and upon jerusalem i will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of assyria and the glory of his high looks for he saith by the strength of my hand and by my wisdom i have done these things for i am prudent and i have moved the borders of the people and have robbed their treasures and i have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man and my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people and as one gathereth eggs that are left have i gathered all the earth and there was none that moved the wing or opened the mouth or peeped shall the ax boast itself against him that heweth therewith shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up or as if the staff should lift up itself as if it were no wood therefore shall the lord the lord of hosts send among his fat ones leanness and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire and the light of israel shall be for a fire and his holy one for a flame and shall burn and shall devour his thorns and his briers in one day and shall consume the glory of his forest and of his fruitful field both soul and body
