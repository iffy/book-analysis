of exhortation unto you behold i would exhort you that when ye shall read these things if it be wisdom in god that ye should read them that ye would remember how merciful the lord hath been unto the children of men from the creation of adam even down unto the time that ye shall receive these things and ponder it in your hearts and when ye shall receive these things i would exhort you that ye would ask god the eternal father in the name of christ if these things are not true and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart with real intent having faith in christ he will manifest the truth of it unto you by the power of the holy ghost and by the power of the holy ghost ye may know the truth of all things and whatsoever thing is good is just and true wherefore nothing that is good denieth the christ but acknowledgeth that he is and ye may know that he is by the power of the holy ghost wherefore i would exhort you that ye deny not the power of god for he worketh by power according to the faith of the children of men the same today and tomorrow and forever and again i exhort you my brethren that ye deny not the gifts of god for they are many and they come from the same god and there are different ways that these gifts are administered but it is the same god who worketh all in all and they are given by the manifestations of the spirit of god unto men to profit them for behold to one is given by the spirit of god that he may teach the word of wisdom and to another that he may teach the word of knowledge by the same spirit and to another exceedingly great faith and to another the gifts of healing by the same spirit and again to another that he may work mighty miracles and again to another that he may prophesy concerning all things and again to another the beholding of angels and ministering spirits and again to another
