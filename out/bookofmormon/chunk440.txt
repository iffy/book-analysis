and to destroy the foundation of liberty which god had granted unto them or which blessing god had sent upon the face of the land for the righteous sake and now it came to pass that when moroni who was the chief commander of the armies of the nephites had heard of these dissensions he was angry with amalickiah and it came to pass that he rent his coat and he took a piece thereof and wrote upon it in memory of our god our religion and freedom and our peace our wives and our children and he fastened it upon the end of a pole and he fastened on his head-plate and his breastplate and his shields and girded on his armor about his loins and he took the pole which had on the end thereof his rent coat and he called it the title of liberty and he bowed himself to the earth and he prayed mightily unto his god for the blessings of liberty to rest upon his brethren so long as there should a band of christians remain to possess the land for thus were all the true believers of christ who belonged to the church of god called by those who did not belong to the church and those who did belong to the church were faithful yea all those who were true believers in christ took upon them gladly the name of christ or christians as they were called because of their belief in christ who should come and therefore at this time moroni prayed that the cause of the christians and the freedom of the land might be favored and it came to pass that when he had poured out his soul to god he named all the land which was south of the land desolation yea and in fine all the land both on the north and on the south a chosen land and the land of liberty and he said surely god shall not suffer that we who are despised because we take upon us the name of christ shall be trodden down and destroyed until we bring it upon us by our own transgressions
