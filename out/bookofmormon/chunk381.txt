to the law of moses for they were taught to keep the law of moses until it should be fulfilled and thus the people did have no disturbance in all the sixteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of nephi and it came to pass that in the commencement of the seventeenth year of the reign of the judges there was continual peace but it came to pass in the latter end of the seventeenth year there came a man into the land of zarahemla and he was anti-christ for he began to preach unto the people against the prophecies which had been spoken by the prophets concerning the coming of christ now there was no law against a mans belief for it was strictly contrary to the commands of god that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds for thus saith the scripture choose ye this day whom ye will serve now if a man desired to serve god it was his privilege or rather if he believed in god it was his privilege to serve him but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him but if he murdered he was punished unto death and if he robbed he was also punished and if he stole he was also punished and if he committed adultery he was also punished yea for all this wickedness they were punished for there was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes nevertheless there was no law against a mans belief therefore a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done therefore all men were on equal grounds and this anti-christ whose name was korihor and the law could have no hold upon him began to preach unto the people that there should be no christ and after this manner did he preach saying o ye that are bound down under a foolish and a vain hope why do ye yoke yourselves with such foolish things why do ye look for a christ for no man can know of anything which is to come
