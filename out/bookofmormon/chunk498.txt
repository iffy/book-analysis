fortify our armies and grant unto them food for their support behold i will leave a part of my freemen to maintain this part of our land and i will leave the strength and the blessings of god upon them that none other power can operate against them and this because of their exceeding faith and their patience in their tribulations and i will come unto you and if there be any among you that has a desire for freedom yea if there be even a spark of freedom remaining behold i will stir up insurrections among you even until those who have desires to usurp power and authority shall become extinct yea behold i do not fear your power nor your authority but it is my god whom i fear and it is according to his commandments that i do take my sword to defend the cause of my country and it is because of your iniquity that we have suffered so much loss behold it is time yea the time is now at hand that except ye do bestir yourselves in the defence of your country and your little ones the sword of justice doth hang over you yea and it shall fall upon you and visit you even to your utter destruction behold i wait for assistance from you and except ye do administer unto our relief behold i come unto you even in the land of zarahemla and smite you with the sword insomuch that ye can have no more power to impede the progress of this people in the cause of our freedom for behold the lord will not suffer that ye shall live and wax strong in your iniquities to destroy his righteous people behold can you suppose that the lord will spare you and come out in judgment against the lamanites when it is the tradition of their fathers that has caused their hatred yea and it has been redoubled by those who have dissented from us while your iniquity is for the cause of your love of glory and the vain things of the world ye know that ye do transgress the laws of god
