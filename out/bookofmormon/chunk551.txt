which is iniquity and how slow are they to remember the lord their god and to give ear unto his counsels yea how slow to walk in wisdoms paths behold they do not desire that the lord their god who hath created them should rule and reign over them notwithstanding his great goodness and his mercy towards them they do set at naught his counsels and they will not that he should be their guide o how great is the nothingness of the children of men yea even they are less than the dust of the earth for behold the dust of the earth moveth hither and thither to the dividing asunder at the command of our great and everlasting god yea behold at his voice do the hills and the mountains tremble and quake and by the power of his voice they are broken up and become smooth yea even like unto a valley yea by the power of his voice doth the whole earth shake yea by the power of his voice do the foundations rock even to the very center yea and if he say unto the earth move it is moved yea if he say unto the earth thou shalt go back that it lengthen out the day for many hours it is done and thus according to his word the earth goeth back and it appeareth unto man that the sun standeth still yea and behold this is so for surely it is the earth that moveth and not the sun and behold also if he say unto the waters of the great deep be thou dried up it is done behold if he say unto this mountain be thou raised up and come over and fall upon that city that it be buried up behold it is done and behold if a man hide up a treasure in the earth and the lord shall say let it be accursed because of the iniquity of him who hath hid it up behold it shall be accursed and if the lord shall say be thou accursed that no man shall find thee from this time henceforth and forever behold
