your cross than that ye should be cast into hell it hath been written that whosoever shall put away his wife let him give her a writing of divorcement verily verily i say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication causeth her to commit adultery and whoso shall marry her who is divorced committeth adultery and again it is written thou shalt not forswear thyself but shalt perform unto the lord thine oaths but verily verily i say unto you swear not at all neither by heaven for it is gods throne nor by the earth for it is his footstool neither shalt thou swear by thy head because thou canst not make one hair black or white but let your communication be yea yea nay nay for whatsoever cometh of more than these is evil and behold it is written an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but i say unto you that ye shall not resist evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him twain give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not away and behold it is written also that thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them who despitefully use you and persecute you that ye may be the children of your father who is in heaven for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good therefore those things which were of old time which were under the law in me are all fulfilled old things are done away and all things have become new therefore i would that ye should be perfect even as i or your father who is in heaven is perfect nephi chapter verily
