by all that is most dear unto us yea and this is not all i command you by all the desires which ye have for life that ye deliver up your weapons of war unto us and we will seek not your blood but we will spare your lives if ye will go your way and come not again to war against us and now if ye do not this behold ye are in our hands and i will command my men that they shall fall upon you and inflict the wounds of death in your bodies that ye may become extinct and then we will see who shall have power over this people yea we will see who shall be brought into bondage and now it came to pass that when zerahemnah had heard these sayings he came forth and delivered up his sword and his cimeter and his bow into the hands of moroni and said unto him behold here are our weapons of war we will deliver them up unto you but we will not suffer ourselves to take an oath unto you which we know that we shall break and also our children but take our weapons of war and suffer that we may depart into the wilderness otherwise we will retain our swords and we will perish or conquer behold we are not of your faith we do not believe that it is god that has delivered us into your hands but we believe that it is your cunning that has preserved you from our swords behold it is your breastplates and your shields that have preserved you and now when zerahemnah had made an end of speaking these words moroni returned the sword and the weapons of war which he had received unto zerahemnah saying behold we will end the conflict now i cannot recall the words which i have spoken therefore as the lord liveth ye shall not depart except ye depart with an oath that ye will not return again against us to war now as ye are in our hands we will spill your blood upon the ground or ye shall submit to the conditions
