of the kings servants said unto him rabbanah which is being interpreted powerful or great king considering their kings to be powerful and thus he said unto him rabbanah the king desireth thee to stay therefore ammon turned himself unto the king and said unto him what wilt thou that i should do for thee o king and the king answered him not for the space of an hour according to their time for he knew not what he should say unto him and it came to pass that ammon said unto him again what desirest thou of me but the king answered him not and it came to pass that ammon being filled with the spirit of god therefore he perceived the thoughts of the king and he said unto him is it because thou hast heard that i defended thy servants and thy flocks and slew seven of their brethren with the sling and with the sword and smote off the arms of others in order to defend thy flocks and thy servants behold is it this that causeth thy marvelings i say unto you what is it that thy marvelings are so great behold i am a man and am thy servant therefore whatsoever thou desirest which is right that will i do now when the king had heard these words he marveled again for he beheld that ammon could discern his thoughts but notwithstanding this king lamoni did open his mouth and said unto him who art thou art thou that great spirit who knows all things ammon answered and said unto him i am not and the king said how knowest thou the thoughts of my heart thou mayest speak boldly and tell me concerning these things and also tell me by what power ye slew and smote off the arms of my brethren that scattered my flocks and now if thou wilt tell me concerning these things whatsoever thou desirest i will give unto thee and if it were needed i would guard thee with my armies but i know that thou art more powerful than all they nevertheless whatsoever thou desirest of me i will grant it
