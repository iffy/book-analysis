should be destroyed and the inhabitants thereof many should perish by the sword and many should be carried away captive into babylon and it came to pass that when my father had read and seen many great and marvelous things he did exclaim many things unto the lord such as great and marvelous are thy works o lord god almighty thy throne is high in the heavens and thy power and goodness and mercy are over all the inhabitants of the earth and because thou art merciful thou wilt not suffer those who come unto thee that they shall perish and after this manner was the language of my father in the praising of his god for his soul did rejoice and his whole heart was filled because of the things which he had seen yea which the lord had shown unto him and now i nephi do not make a full account of the things which my father hath written for he hath written many things which he saw in visions and in dreams and he also hath written many things which he prophesied and spake unto his children of which i shall not make a full account but i shall make an account of my proceedings in my days behold i make an abridgment of the record of my father upon plates which i have made with mine own hands wherefore after i have abridged the record of my father then will i make an account of mine own life therefore i would that ye should know that after the lord had shown so many marvelous things unto my father lehi yea concerning the destruction of jerusalem behold he went forth among the people and began to prophesy and to declare unto them concerning the things which he had both seen and heard and it came to pass that the jews did mock him because of the things which he testified of them for he truly testified of their wickedness and their abominations and he testified that the things which he saw and heard and also the things which he read in the book manifested plainly of the coming of the messiah
