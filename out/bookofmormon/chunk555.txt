also the treasure and none shall redeem it because of the curse of the land and the day shall come that they shall hide up their treasures because they have set their hearts upon riches and because they have set their hearts upon their riches and will hide up their treasures when they shall flee before their enemies because they will not hide them up unto me cursed be they and also their treasures and in that day shall they be smitten saith the lord behold ye the people of this great city and hearken unto my words yea hearken unto the words which the lord saith for behold he saith that ye are cursed because of your riches and also are your riches cursed because ye have set your hearts upon them and have not hearkened unto the words of him who gave them unto you ye do not remember the lord your god in the things with which he hath blessed you but ye do always remember your riches not to thank the lord your god for them yea your hearts are not drawn out unto the lord but they do swell with great pride unto boasting and unto great swelling envyings strifes malice persecutions and murders and all manner of iniquities for this cause hath the lord god caused that a curse should come upon the land and also upon your riches and this because of your iniquities yea wo unto this people because of this time which has arrived that ye do cast out the prophets and do mock them and cast stones at them and do slay them and do all manner of iniquity unto them even as they did of old time and now when ye talk ye say if our days had been in the days of our fathers of old we would not have slain the prophets we would not have stoned them and cast them out behold ye are worse than they for as the lord liveth if a prophet come among you and declareth unto you the word of the lord which testifieth of your sins and iniquities ye are angry with him
