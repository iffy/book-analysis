the pleasing word of god have daggers placed to pierce their souls and wound their delicate minds but notwithstanding the greatness of the task i must do according to the strict commands of god and tell you concerning your wickedness and abominations in the presence of the pure in heart and the broken heart and under the glance of the piercing eye of the almighty god wherefore i must tell you the truth according to the plainness of the word of god for behold as i inquired of the lord thus came the word unto me saying jacob get thou up into the temple on the morrow and declare the word which i shall give thee unto this people and now behold my brethren this is the word which i declare unto you that many of you have begun to search for gold and for silver and for all manner of precious ores in the which this land which is a land of promise unto you and to your seed doth abound most plentifully and the hand of providence hath smiled upon you most pleasingly that you have obtained many riches and because some of you have obtained more abundantly than that of your brethren ye are lifted up in the pride of your hearts and wear stiff necks and high heads because of the costliness of your apparel and persecute your brethren because ye suppose that ye are better than they and now my brethren do ye suppose that god justifieth you in this thing behold i say unto you nay but he condemneth you and if ye persist in these things his judgments must speedily come unto you o that he would show you that he can pierce you and with one glance of his eye he can smite you to the dust o that he would rid you from this iniquity and abomination and o that ye would listen unto the word of his commands and let not this pride of your hearts destroy your souls think of your brethren like unto yourselves and be familiar with all and free with your substance that they may be rich like unto you
