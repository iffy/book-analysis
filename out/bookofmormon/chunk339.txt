them by his words saying my brethren be of good cheer and let us go in search of the flocks and we will gather them together and bring them back unto the place of water and thus we will preserve the flocks unto the king and he will not slay us and it came to pass that they went in search of the flocks and they did follow ammon and they rushed forth with much swiftness and did head the flocks of the king and did gather them together again to the place of water and those men again stood to scatter their flocks but ammon said unto his brethren encircle the flocks round about that they flee not and i go and contend with these men who do scatter our flocks therefore they did as ammon commanded them and he went forth and stood to contend with those who stood by the waters of sebus and they were in number not a few therefore they did not fear ammon for they supposed that one of their men could slay him according to their pleasure for they knew not that the lord had promised mosiah that he would deliver his sons out of their hands neither did they know anything concerning the lord therefore they delighted in the destruction of their brethren and for this cause they stood to scatter the flocks of the king but ammon stood forth and began to cast stones at them with his sling yea with mighty power he did sling stones amongst them and thus he slew a certain number of them insomuch that they began to be astonished at his power nevertheless they were angry because of the slain of their brethren and they were determined that he should fall therefore seeing that they could not hit him with their stones they came forth with clubs to slay him but behold every man that lifted his club to smite ammon he smote off their arms with his sword for he did withstand their blows by smiting their arms with the edge of his sword insomuch that they began to be astonished and began to flee before him
