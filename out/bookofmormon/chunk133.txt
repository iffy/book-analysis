and when the spirit ceaseth to strive with man then cometh speedy destruction and this grieveth my soul and as i spake concerning the convincing of the jews that jesus is the very christ it must needs be that the gentiles be convinced also that jesus is the christ the eternal god and that he manifesteth himself unto all those who believe in him by the power of the holy ghost yea unto every nation kindred tongue and people working mighty miracles signs and wonders among the children of men according to their faith but behold i prophesy unto you concerning the last days concerning the days when the lord god shall bring these things forth unto the children of men after my seed and the seed of my brethren shall have dwindled in unbelief and shall have been smitten by the gentiles yea after the lord god shall have camped against them round about and shall have laid siege against them with a mount and raised forts against them and after they shall have been brought down low in the dust even that they are not yet the words of the righteous shall be written and the prayers of the faithful shall be heard and all those who have dwindled in unbelief shall not be forgotten for those who shall be destroyed shall speak unto them out of the ground and their speech shall be low out of the dust and their voice shall be as one that hath a familiar spirit for the lord god will give unto him power that he may whisper concerning them even as it were out of the ground and their speech shall whisper out of the dust for thus saith the lord god they shall write the things which shall be done among them and they shall be written and sealed up in a book and those who have dwindled in unbelief shall not have them for they seek to destroy the things of god wherefore as those who have been destroyed have been destroyed speedily and the multitude of their terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth away yea thus saith the lord god
