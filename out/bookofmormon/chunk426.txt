and god would cease to be god but god ceaseth not to be god and mercy claimeth the penitent and mercy cometh because of the atonement and the atonement bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead and the resurrection of the dead bringeth back men into the presence of god and thus they are restored into his presence to be judged according to their works according to the law and justice for behold justice exerciseth all his demands and also mercy claimeth all which is her own and thus none but the truly penitent are saved what do ye suppose that mercy can rob justice i say unto you nay not one whit if so god would cease to be god and thus god bringeth about his great and eternal purposes which were prepared from the foundation of the world and thus cometh about the salvation and the redemption of men and also their destruction and misery therefore o my son whosoever will come may come and partake of the waters of life freely and whosoever will not come the same is not compelled to come but in the last day it shall be restored unto him according to his deeds if he has desired to do evil and has not repented in his days behold evil shall be done unto him according to the restoration of god and now my son i desire that ye should let these things trouble you no more and only let your sins trouble you with that trouble which shall bring you down unto repentance o my son i desire that ye should deny the justice of god no more do not endeavor to excuse yourself in the least point because of your sins by denying the justice of god but do you let the justice of god and his mercy and his long-suffering have full sway in your heart and let it bring you down to the dust in humility and now o my son ye are called of god to preach the word unto this people and now my son go thy way declare the word with truth and soberness that thou mayest bring souls
