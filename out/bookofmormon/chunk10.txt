came to pass that we fled into the wilderness and the servants of laban did not overtake us and we hid ourselves in the cavity of a rock and it came to pass that laman was angry with me and also with my father and also was lemuel for he hearkened unto the words of laman wherefore laman and lemuel did speak many hard words unto us their younger brothers and they did smite us even with a rod and it came to pass as they smote us with a rod behold an angel of the lord came and stood before them and he spake unto them saying why do ye smite your younger brother with a rod know ye not that the lord hath chosen him to be a ruler over you and this because of your iniquities behold ye shall go up to jerusalem again and the lord will deliver laban into your hands and after the angel had spoken unto us he departed and after the angel had departed laman and lemuel again began to murmur saying how is it possible that the lord will deliver laban into our hands behold he is a mighty man and he can command fifty yea even he can slay fifty then why not us nephi chapter and it came to pass that i spake unto my brethren saying let us go up again unto jerusalem and let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the lord for behold he is mightier than all the earth then why not mightier than laban and his fifty yea or even than his tens of thousands therefore let us go up let us be strong like unto moses for he truly spake unto the waters of the red sea and they divided hither and thither and our fathers came through out of captivity on dry ground and the armies of pharaoh did follow and were drowned in the waters of the red sea now behold ye know that this is true and ye also know that an angel hath spoken unto you wherefore can ye doubt let us go up the lord is able to deliver us
