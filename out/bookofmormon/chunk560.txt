of many hours and the earth shall shake and tremble and the rocks which are upon the face of this earth which are both above the earth and beneath which ye know at this time are solid or the more part of it is one solid mass shall be broken up yea they shall be rent in twain and shall ever after be found in seams and in cracks and in broken fragments upon the face of the whole earth yea both above the earth and beneath and behold there shall be great tempests and there shall be many mountains laid low like unto a valley and there shall be many places which are now called valleys which shall become mountains whose height is great and many highways shall be broken up and many cities shall become desolate and many graves shall be opened and shall yield up many of their dead and many saints shall appear unto many and behold thus hath the angel spoken unto me for he said unto me that there should be thunderings and lightnings for the space of many hours and he said unto me that while the thunder and the lightning lasted and the tempest that these things should be and that darkness should cover the face of the whole earth for the space of three days and the angel said unto me that many shall see greater things than these to the intent that they might believe that these signs and these wonders should come to pass upon all the face of this land to the intent that there should be no cause for unbelief among the children of men and this to the intent that whosoever will believe might be saved and that whosoever will not believe a righteous judgment might come upon them and also if they are condemned they bring upon themselves their own condemnation and now remember remember my brethren that whosoever perisheth perisheth unto himself and whosoever doeth iniquity doeth it unto himself for behold ye are free ye are permitted to act for yourselves for behold god hath given unto you a knowledge and he hath made you free
