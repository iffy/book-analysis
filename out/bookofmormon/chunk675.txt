of miracles and yet be an unchangeable being and behold i say unto you he changeth not if so he would cease to be god and he ceaseth not to be god and is a god of miracles and the reason why he ceaseth to do miracles among the children of men is because that they dwindle in unbelief and depart from the right way and know not the god in whom they should trust behold i say unto you that whoso believeth in christ doubting nothing whatsoever he shall ask the father in the name of christ it shall be granted him and this promise is unto all even unto the ends of the earth for behold thus said jesus christ the son of god unto his disciples who should tarry yea and also to all his disciples in the hearing of the multitude go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and whosoever shall believe in my name doubting nothing unto him will i confirm all my words even unto the ends of the earth and now behold who can stand against the works of the lord who can deny his sayings who will rise up against the almighty power of the lord who will despise the works of the lord who will despise the children of christ behold all ye who are despisers of the works of the lord for ye shall wonder and perish o then despise not and wonder not but hearken unto the words of the lord and ask the father in the name of jesus for what things soever ye shall stand in need doubt not but be believing and begin as in times of old and come unto the lord with all
