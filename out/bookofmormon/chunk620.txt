bear record and angels did come down out of heaven and did minister unto them and it came to pass that while the angels were ministering unto the disciples behold jesus came and stood in the midst and ministered unto them and it came to pass that he spake unto the multitude and commanded them that they should kneel down again upon the earth and also that his disciples should kneel down upon the earth and it came to pass that when they had all knelt down upon the earth he commanded his disciples that they should pray and behold they began to pray and they did pray unto jesus calling him their lord and their god and it came to pass that jesus departed out of the midst of them and went a little way off from them and bowed himself to the earth and he said father i thank thee that thou hast given the holy ghost unto these whom i have chosen and it is because of their belief in me that i have chosen them out of the world father i pray thee that thou wilt give the holy ghost unto all them that shall believe in their words father thou hast given them the holy ghost because they believe in me and thou seest that they believe in me because thou hearest them and they pray unto me and they pray unto me because i am with them and now father i pray unto thee for them and also for all those who shall believe on their words that they may believe in me that i may be in them as thou father art in me that we may be one and it came to pass that when jesus had thus prayed unto the father he came unto his disciples and behold they did still continue without ceasing to pray unto him and they did not multiply many words for it was given unto them what they should pray and they were filled with desire and it came to pass that jesus blessed them as they did pray unto him and his countenance did smile upon them and
