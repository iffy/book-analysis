must surely stand before the judgment-seat of christ yea even among the gentiles shall there be a great and marvelous work wrought by them before that judgment day and if ye had all the scriptures which give an account of all the marvelous works of christ ye would according to the words of christ know that these things must surely come and wo be unto him that will not hearken unto the words of jesus and also to them whom he hath chosen and sent among them for whoso receiveth not the words of jesus and the words of those whom he hath sent receiveth not him and therefore he will not receive them at the last day and it would be better for them if they had not been born for do ye suppose that ye can get rid of the justice of an offended god who hath been trampled under feet of men that thereby salvation might come and now behold as i spake concerning those whom the lord hath chosen yea even three who were caught up into the heavens that i knew not whether they were cleansed from mortality to immortality but behold since i wrote i have inquired of the lord and he hath made it manifest unto me that there must needs be a change wrought upon their bodies or else it needs be that they must taste of death therefore that they might not taste of death there was a change wrought upon their bodies that they might not suffer pain nor sorrow save it were for the sins of the world now this change was not equal to that which shall take place at the last day but there was a change wrought upon them insomuch that satan could have no power over them that he could not tempt them and they were sanctified in the flesh that they were holy and that the powers of the earth could not hold them nephi and in this state they were to remain until the judgment day of christ and at that day they were to receive a greater change and to be received into the kingdom
