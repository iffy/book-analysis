it was possible to stop them in their retreat and now the city of jashon was near the land where ammaron had deposited the records unto the lord that they might not be destroyed and behold i had gone according to the word of ammaron and taken the plates of nephi and did make a record according to the words of ammaron and upon the plates of nephi i did make a full account of all the wickedness and abominations but upon these plates i did forbear to make a full account of their wickedness and abominations for behold a continual scene of wickedness and abominations has been before mine eyes ever since i have been sufficient to behold the ways of man and wo is me because of their wickedness for my heart has been filled with sorrow because of their wickedness all my days nevertheless i know that i shall be lifted up at the last day and it came to pass that in this year the people of nephi again were hunted and driven and it came to pass that we were driven forth until we had come northward to the land which was called shem and it came to pass that we did fortify the city of shem and we did gather in our people as much as it were possible that perhaps we might save them from destruction and it came to pass in the three hundred and forty and sixth year they began to come upon us again and it came to pass that i did speak unto my people and did urge them with great energy that they would stand boldly before the lamanites and fight for their wives and their children and their houses and their homes and my words did arouse them somewhat to vigor insomuch that they did not flee from before the lamanites but did stand with boldness against them and it came to pass that we did contend with an army of thirty thousand against an army of fifty thousand and it came to pass that we did stand before them with such firmness that they did flee from before us
