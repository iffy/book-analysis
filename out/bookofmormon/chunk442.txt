hath been preserved so shall a remnant of the seed of my son be preserved by the hand of god and be taken unto himself while the remainder of the seed of joseph shall perish even as the remnant of his garment now behold this giveth my soul sorrow nevertheless my soul hath joy in my son because of that part of his seed which shall be taken unto god now behold this was the language of jacob and now who knoweth but what the remnant of the seed of joseph which shall perish as his garment are those who have dissented from us yea and even it shall be ourselves if we do not stand fast in the faith of christ and now it came to pass that when moroni had said these words he went forth and also sent forth in all the parts of the land where there were dissensions and gathered together all the people who were desirous to maintain their liberty to stand against amalickiah and those who had dissented who were called amalickiahites and it came to pass that when amalickiah saw that the people of moroni were more numerous than the amalickiahites and he also saw that his people were doubtful concerning the justice of the cause in which they had undertaken therefore fearing that he should not gain the point he took those of his people who would and departed into the land of nephi now moroni thought it was not expedient that the lamanites should have any more strength therefore he thought to cut off the people of amalickiah or to take them and bring them back and put amalickiah to death yea for he knew that he would stir up the lamanites to anger against them and cause them to come to battle against them and this he knew that amalickiah would do that he might obtain his purposes therefore moroni thought it was expedient that he should take his armies who had gathered themselves together and armed themselves and entered into a covenant to keep the peace and it came to pass that he took his army and marched out with his tents
