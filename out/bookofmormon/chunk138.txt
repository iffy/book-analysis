the words thereof to him that is not learned and the man that is not learned shall say i am not learned then shall the lord god say unto him the learned shall not read them for they have rejected them and i am able to do mine own work wherefore thou shalt read the words which i shall give unto thee touch not the things which are sealed for i will bring them forth in mine own due time for i will show unto the children of men that i am able to do mine own work wherefore when thou hast read the words which i have commanded thee and obtained the witnesses which i have promised unto thee then shalt thou seal up the book again and hide it up unto me that i may preserve the words which thou hast not read until i shall see fit in mine own wisdom to reveal all things unto the children of men for behold i am god and i am a god of miracles and i will show unto the world that i am the same yesterday today and forever and i work not among the children of men save it be according to their faith and again it shall come to pass that the lord shall say unto him that shall read the words that shall be delivered him forasmuch as this people draw near unto me with their mouth and with their lips do honor me but have removed their hearts far from me and their fear towards me is taught by the precepts of men therefore i will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people yea a marvelous work and a wonder for the wisdom of their wise and learned shall perish and the understanding of their prudent shall be hid and wo unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the lord and their works are in the dark and they say who seeth us and who knoweth us and they also say surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potters clay but behold i will show unto them saith
