people saying repent ye for thus saith the lord except ye repent i will visit this people in mine anger yea and i will not turn my fierce anger away and alma went forth and also amulek among the people to declare the words of god unto them and they were filled with the holy ghost and they had power given unto them insomuch that they could not be confined in dungeons neither was it possible that any man could slay them nevertheless they did not exercise their power until they were bound in bands and cast into prison now this was done that the lord might show forth his power in them and it came to pass that they went forth and began to preach and to prophesy unto the people according to the spirit and power which the lord had given them alma chapter and again i alma having been commanded of god that i should take amulek and go forth and preach again unto this people or the people who were in the city of ammonihah it came to pass as i began to preach unto them they began to contend with me saying who art thou suppose ye that we shall believe the testimony of one man although he should preach unto us that the earth should pass away now they understood not the words which they spake for they knew not that the earth should pass away and they said also we will not believe thy words if thou shouldst prophesy that this great city should be destroyed in one day now they knew not that god could do such marvelous works for they were a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked people and they said who is god that sendeth no more authority than one man among this people to declare unto them the truth of such great and marvelous things and they stood forth to lay their hands on me but behold they did not and i stood with boldness to declare unto them yea i did boldly testify unto them saying behold o ye wicked and perverse generation how have ye forgotten the tradition of your fathers yea
