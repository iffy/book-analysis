preserve their lives and this was their faith that by so doing god would prosper them in the land or in other words if they were faithful in keeping the commandments of god that he would prosper them in the land yea warn them to flee or to prepare for war according to their danger and also that god would make it known unto them whither they should go to defend themselves against their enemies and by so doing the lord would deliver them and this was the faith of moroni and his heart did glory in it not in the shedding of blood but in doing good in preserving his people yea in keeping the commandments of god yea and resisting iniquity yea verily verily i say unto you if all men had been and were and ever would be like unto moroni behold the very powers of hell would have been shaken forever yea the devil would never have power over the hearts of the children of men behold he was a man like unto ammon the son of mosiah yea and even the other sons of mosiah yea and also alma and his sons for they were all men of god now behold helaman and his brethren were no less serviceable unto the people than was moroni for they did preach the word of god and they did baptize unto repentance all men whosoever would hearken unto their words and thus they went forth and the people did humble themselves because of their words insomuch that they were highly favored of the lord and thus they were free from wars and contentions among themselves yea even for the space of four years but as i have said in the latter end of the nineteenth year yea notwithstanding their peace amongst themselves they were compelled reluctantly to contend with their brethren the lamanites yea and in fine their wars never did cease for the space of many years with the lamanites notwithstanding their much reluctance now they were sorry to take up arms against the lamanites because they did not delight in the shedding of blood yea and this was not all
