came to pass that after limhi had heard the words of ammon he was exceedingly glad and said now i know of a surety that my brethren who were in the land of zarahemla are yet alive and now i will rejoice and on the morrow i will cause that my people shall rejoice also for behold we are in bondage to the lamanites and are taxed with a tax which is grievous to be borne and now behold our brethren will deliver us out of our bondage or out of the hands of the lamanites and we will be their slaves for it is better that we be slaves to the nephites than to pay tribute to the king of the lamanites and now king limhi commanded his guards that they should no more bind ammon nor his brethren but caused that they should go to the hill which was north of shilom and bring their brethren into the city that thereby they might eat and drink and rest themselves from the labors of their journey for they had suffered many things they had suffered hunger thirst and fatigue and now it came to pass on the morrow that king limhi sent a proclamation among all his people that thereby they might gather themselves together to the temple to hear the words which he should speak unto them and it came to pass that when they had gathered themselves together that he spake unto them in this wise saying o ye my people lift up your heads and be comforted for behold the time is at hand or is not far distant when we shall no longer be in subjection to our enemies notwithstanding our many strugglings which have been in vain yet i trust there remaineth an effectual struggle to be made therefore lift up your heads and rejoice and put your trust in god in that god who was the god of abraham and isaac and jacob and also that god who brought the children of israel out of the land of egypt and caused that they should walk through the red sea on dry ground and fed them with manna
