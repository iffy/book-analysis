to battle and it was in the sixth month and behold great and terrible was the day that they did come up to battle and they were girded about after the manner of robbers and they had a lamb-skin about their loins and they were dyed in blood and their heads were shorn and they had head-plates upon them and great and terrible was the appearance of the armies of giddianhi because of their armor and because of their being dyed in blood and it came to pass that the armies of the nephites when they saw the appearance of the army of giddianhi had all fallen to the earth and did lift their cries to the lord their god that he would spare them and deliver them out of the hands of their enemies and it came to pass that when the armies of giddianhi saw this they began to shout with a loud voice because of their joy for they had supposed that the nephites had fallen with fear because of the terror of their armies but in this thing they were disappointed for the nephites did not fear them but they did fear their god and did supplicate him for protection therefore when the armies of giddianhi did rush upon them they were prepared to meet them yea in the strength of the lord they did receive them and the battle commenced in this the sixth month and great and terrible was the battle thereof yea great and terrible was the slaughter thereof insomuch that there never was known so great a slaughter among all the people of lehi since he left jerusalem and notwithstanding the threatenings and the oaths which giddianhi had made behold the nephites did beat them insomuch that they did fall back from before them and it came to pass that gidgiddoni commanded that his armies should pursue them as far as the borders of the wilderness and that they should not spare any that should fall into their hands by the way and thus they did pursue them and did slay them to the borders of the wilderness even until they had fulfilled the commandment
