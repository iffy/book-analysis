now zerahemnah when he saw that they were all about to be destroyed cried mightily unto moroni promising that he would covenant and also his people with them if they would spare the remainder of their lives that they never would come to war again against them and it came to pass that moroni caused that the work of death should cease again among the people and he took the weapons of war from the lamanites and after they had entered into a covenant with him of peace they were suffered to depart into the wilderness now the number of their dead was not numbered because of the greatness of the number yea the number of their dead was exceedingly great both on the nephites and on the lamanites and it came to pass that they did cast their dead into the waters of sidon and they have gone forth and are buried in the depths of the sea and the armies of the nephites or of moroni returned and came to their houses and their lands and thus ended the eighteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of nephi and thus ended the record of alma which was written upon the plates of nephi alma chapter behold now it came to pass that the people of nephi were exceedingly rejoiced because the lord had again delivered them out of the hands of their enemies therefore they gave thanks unto the lord their god yea and they did fast much and pray much and they did worship god with exceedingly great joy and it came to pass in the nineteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of nephi that alma came unto his son helaman and said unto him believest thou the words which i spake unto thee concerning those records which have been kept and helaman said unto him yea i believe and alma said again believest thou in jesus christ who shall come and he said yea i believe all the words which thou hast spoken and alma said unto him again will ye keep my commandments and he said yea i will keep
