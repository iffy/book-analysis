look forward for the remission of your sins with an everlasting faith which is to come for behold i say unto you there be many things to come and behold there is one thing which is of more importance than they all for behold the time is not far distant that the redeemer liveth and cometh among his people behold i do not say that he will come among us at the time of his dwelling in his mortal tabernacle for behold the spirit hath not said unto me that this should be the case now as to this thing i do not know but this much i do know that the lord god hath power to do all things which are according to his word but behold the spirit hath said this much unto me saying cry unto this people saying repent ye and prepare the way of the lord and walk in his paths which are straight for behold the kingdom of heaven is at hand and the son of god cometh upon the face of the earth and behold he shall be born of mary at jerusalem which is the land of our forefathers she being a virgin a precious and chosen vessel who shall be overshadowed and conceive by the power of the holy ghost and bring forth a son yea even the son of god and he shall go forth suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people and he will take upon him death that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people and he will take upon him their infirmities that his bowels may be filled with mercy according to the flesh that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities now the spirit knoweth all things nevertheless the son of god suffereth according to the flesh that he might take upon him the sins of his people that he might blot out their transgressions according to the power of his deliverance
