upon which i make a full account of my people i have given the name of nephi wherefore they are called the plates of nephi after mine own name and these plates also are called the plates of nephi nevertheless i have received a commandment of the lord that i should make these plates for the special purpose that there should be an account engraven of the ministry of my people upon the other plates should be engraven an account of the reign of the kings and the wars and contentions of my people wherefore these plates are for the more part of the ministry and the other plates are for the more part of the reign of the kings and the wars and contentions of my people wherefore the lord hath commanded me to make these plates for a wise purpose in him which purpose i know not but the lord knoweth all things from the beginning wherefore he prepareth a way to accomplish all his works among the children of men for behold he hath all power unto the fulfilling of all his words and thus it is amen nephi chapter and now i nephi proceed to give an account upon these plates of my proceedings and my reign and ministry wherefore to proceed with mine account i must speak somewhat of the things of my father and also of my brethren for behold it came to pass after my father had made an end of speaking the words of his dream and also of exhorting them to all diligence he spake unto them concerning the jews that after they should be destroyed even that great city jerusalem and many be carried away captive into babylon according to the own due time of the lord they should return again yea even be brought back out of captivity and after they should be brought back out of captivity they should possess again the land of their inheritance yea even six hundred years from the time that my father left jerusalem a prophet would the lord god raise up among the jews even a messiah or in other words a savior of the world
