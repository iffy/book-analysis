which i have proposed and now when moroni had said these words zerahemnah retained his sword and he was angry with moroni and he rushed forward that he might slay moroni but as he raised his sword behold one of moronis soldiers smote it even to the earth and it broke by the hilt and he also smote zerahemnah that he took off his scalp and it fell to the earth and zerahemnah withdrew from before them into the midst of his soldiers and it came to pass that the soldier who stood by who smote off the scalp of zerahemnah took up the scalp from off the ground by the hair and laid it upon the point of his sword and stretched it forth unto them saying unto them with a loud voice even as this scalp has fallen to the earth which is the scalp of your chief so shall ye fall to the earth except ye will deliver up your weapons of war and depart with a covenant of peace now there were many when they heard these words and saw the scalp which was upon the sword that were struck with fear and many came forth and threw down their weapons of war at the feet of moroni and entered into a covenant of peace and as many as entered into a covenant they suffered to depart into the wilderness now it came to pass that zerahemnah was exceedingly wroth and he did stir up the remainder of his soldiers to anger to contend more powerfully against the nephites and now moroni was angry because of the stubbornness of the lamanites therefore he commanded his people that they should fall upon them and slay them and it came to pass that they began to slay them yea and the lamanites did contend with their swords and their might but behold their naked skins and their bare heads were exposed to the sharp swords of the nephites yea behold they were pierced and smitten yea and did fall exceedingly fast before the swords of the nephites and they began to be swept down even as the soldier of moroni had prophesied
