saying ye see that ye have not power to slay me therefore i finish my message yea and i perceive that it cuts you to your hearts because i tell you the truth concerning your iniquities yea and my words fill you with wonder and amazement and with anger but i finish my message and then it matters not whither i go if it so be that i am saved but this much i tell you what you do with me after this shall be as a type and a shadow of things which are to come and now i read unto you the remainder of the commandments of god for i perceive that they are not written in your hearts i perceive that ye have studied and taught iniquity the most part of your lives and now ye remember that i said unto you thou shall not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of things which are in heaven above or which are in the earth beneath or which are in the water under the earth and again thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them nor serve them for i the lord thy god am a jealous god visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generations of them that hate me and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain remember the sabbath day to keep it holy six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work but the seventh day the sabbath of the lord thy god thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter thy man-servant nor thy maid-servant nor thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates for in six days the lord made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them is wherefore the lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it honor thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon
