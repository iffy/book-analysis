the lord as the waters cover the sea wherefore the things of all nations shall be made known yea all things shall be made known unto the children of men there is nothing which is secret save it shall be revealed there is no work of darkness save it shall be made manifest in the light and there is nothing which is sealed upon the earth save it shall be loosed wherefore all things which have been revealed unto the children of men shall at that day be revealed and satan shall have power over the hearts of the children of men no more for a long time and now my beloved brethren i make an end of my sayings nephi chapter and now i nephi make an end of my prophesying unto you my beloved brethren and i cannot write but a few things which i know must surely come to pass neither can i write but a few of the words of my brother jacob wherefore the things which i have written sufficeth me save it be a few words which i must speak concerning the doctrine of christ wherefore i shall speak unto you plainly according to the plainness of my prophesying for my soul delighteth in plainness for after this manner doth the lord god work among the children of men for the lord god giveth light unto the understanding for he speaketh unto men according to their language unto their understanding wherefore i would that ye should remember that i have spoken unto you concerning that prophet which the lord showed unto me that should baptize the lamb of god which should take away the sins of the world and now if the lamb of god he being holy should have need to be baptized by water to fulfil all righteousness o then how much more need have we being unholy to be baptized yea even by water and now i would ask of you my beloved brethren wherein the lamb of god did fulfil all righteousness in being baptized by water know ye not that he was holy but notwithstanding he being holy he showeth unto the children
