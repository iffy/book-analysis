obey amen the book of jacob the brother of nephi the words of his preaching unto his brethren he confoundeth a man who seeketh to overthrow the doctrine of christ a few words concerning the history of the people of nephi jacob chapter for behold it came to pass that fifty and five years had passed away from the time that lehi left jerusalem wherefore nephi gave me jacob a commandment concerning the small plates upon which these things are engraven and he gave me jacob a commandment that i should write upon these plates a few of the things which i consider to be most precious that i should not touch save it were lightly concerning the history of this people which are called the people of nephi for he said that the history of his people should be engraven upon his other plates and that i should preserve these plates and hand them down unto my seed from generation to generation and if there were preaching which was sacred or revelation which was great or prophesying that i should engraven the heads of them upon these plates and touch upon them as much as it were possible for christs sake and for the sake of our people for because of faith and great anxiety it truly had been made manifest unto us concerning our people what things should happen unto them and we also had many revelations and the spirit of much prophecy wherefore we knew of christ and his kingdom which should come wherefore we labored diligently among our people that we might persuade them to come unto christ and partake of the goodness of god that they might enter into his rest lest by any means he should swear in his wrath they should not enter in as in the provocation in the days of temptation while the children of israel were in the wilderness wherefore we would to god that we could persuade all men not to rebel against god to provoke him to anger but that all men would believe in christ and view his death and suffer his cross and bear the shame of the world wherefore
