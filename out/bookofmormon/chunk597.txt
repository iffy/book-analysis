it not and again the third time they did hear the voice and did open their ears to hear it and their eyes were towards the sound thereof and they did look steadfastly towards heaven from whence the sound came and behold the third time they did understand the voice which they heard and it said unto them behold my beloved son in whom i am well pleased in whom i have glorified my name hear ye him and it came to pass as they understood they cast their eyes up again towards heaven and behold they saw a man descending out of heaven and he was clothed in a white robe and he came down and stood in the midst of them and the eyes of the whole multitude were turned upon him and they durst not open their mouths even one to another and wist not what it meant for they thought it was an angel that had appeared unto them and it came to pass that he stretched forth his hand and spake unto the people saying behold i am jesus christ whom the prophets testified shall come into the world and behold i am the light and the life of the world and i have drunk out of that bitter cup which the father hath given me and have glorified the father in taking upon me the sins of the world in the which i have suffered the will of the father in all things from the beginning and it came to pass that when jesus had spoken these words the whole multitude fell to the earth for they remembered that it had been prophesied among them that christ should show himself unto them after his ascension into heaven and it came to pass that the lord spake unto them saying arise and come forth unto me that ye may thrust your hands into my side and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet that ye may know that i am the god of israel and the god of the whole earth and have been slain for the sins
