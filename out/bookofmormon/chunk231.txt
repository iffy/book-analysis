and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no evil neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore will i divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bore the sins of many and made intercession for the transgressors mosiah chapter and now abinadi said unto them i would that ye should understand that god himself shall come down among the children of men and shall redeem his people and because he dwelleth in flesh he shall be called the son of god and having subjected the flesh to the will of the father being the father and the son the father because he was conceived by the power of god and the son because of the flesh thus becoming the father and son and they are one god yea the very eternal father of heaven and of earth and thus the flesh becoming subject to the spirit or the son to the father being one god suffereth temptation and yieldeth not to the temptation but suffereth himself to be mocked and scourged and cast out and disowned by his people and after all this after working many mighty miracles among the children of men he shall be led yea even as isaiah said as a sheep before the shearer is dumb so he opened not his mouth yea even so he shall be led crucified and slain the flesh becoming subject even unto death the will of the son being swallowed up in the will of the father and thus god breaketh the bands
