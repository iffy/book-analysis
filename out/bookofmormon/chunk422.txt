behold it is requisite and just according to the power and resurrection of christ that the soul of man should be restored to its body and that every part of the body should be restored to itself and it is requisite with the justice of god that men should be judged according to their works and if their works were good in this life and the desires of their hearts were good that they should also at the last day be restored unto that which is good and if their works are evil they shall be restored unto them for evil therefore all things shall be restored to their proper order every thing to its natural frame mortality raised to immortality corruption to incorruption raised to endless happiness to inherit the kingdom of god or to endless misery to inherit the kingdom of the devil the one on one hand the other on the other the one raised to happiness according to his desires of happiness or good according to his desires of good and the other to evil according to his desires of evil for as he has desired to do evil all the day long even so shall he have his reward of evil when the night cometh and so it is on the other hand if he hath repented of his sins and desired righteousness until the end of his days even so he shall be rewarded unto righteousness these are they that are redeemed of the lord yea these are they that are taken out that are delivered from that endless night of darkness and thus they stand or fall for behold they are their own judges whether to do good or do evil now the decrees of god are unalterable therefore the way is prepared that whosoever will may walk therein and be saved and now behold my son do not risk one more offense against your god upon those points of doctrine which ye have hitherto risked to commit sin do not suppose because it has been spoken concerning restoration that ye shall be restored from sin to happiness behold i say unto you wickedness never was happiness
