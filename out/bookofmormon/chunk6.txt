he called the name of the river laman and it emptied into the red sea and the valley was in the borders near the mouth thereof and when my father saw that the waters of the river emptied into the fountain of the red sea he spake unto laman saying o that thou mightest be like unto this river continually running into the fountain of all righteousness and he also spake unto lemuel o that thou mightest be like unto this valley firm and steadfast and immovable in keeping the commandments of the lord now this he spake because of the stiffneckedness of laman and lemuel for behold they did murmur in many things against their father because he was a visionary man and had led them out of the land of jerusalem to leave the land of their inheritance and their gold and their silver and their precious things to perish in the wilderness and this they said he had done because of the foolish imaginations of his heart and thus laman and lemuel being the eldest did murmur against their father and they did murmur because they knew not the dealings of that god who had created them neither did they believe that jerusalem that great city could be destroyed according to the words of the prophets and they were like unto the jews who were at jerusalem who sought to take away the life of my father and it came to pass that my father did speak unto them in the valley of lemuel with power being filled with the spirit until their frames did shake before him and he did confound them that they durst not utter against him wherefore they did as he commanded them and my father dwelt in a tent and it came to pass that i nephi being exceedingly young nevertheless being large in stature and also having great desires to know of the mysteries of god wherefore i did cry unto the lord and behold he did visit me and did soften my heart that i did believe all the words which had been spoken by my father wherefore i did not rebel against him
