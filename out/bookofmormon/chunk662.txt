passed away and it came to pass that in the three hundred and eightieth year the lamanites did come again against us to battle and we did stand against them boldly but it was all in vain for so great were their numbers that they did tread the people of the nephites under their feet and it came to pass that we did again take to flight and those whose flight was swifter than the lamanites did escape and those whose flight did not exceed the lamanites were swept down and destroyed and now behold i mormon do not desire to harrow up the souls of men in casting before them such an awful scene of blood and carnage as was laid before mine eyes but i knowing that these things must surely be made known and that all things which are hid must be revealed upon the house-tops and also that a knowledge of these things must come unto the remnant of these people and also unto the gentiles who the lord hath said should scatter this people and this people should be counted as naught among them therefore i write a small abridgment daring not to give a full account of the things which i have seen because of the commandment which i have received and also that ye might not have too great sorrow because of the wickedness of this people and now behold this i speak unto their seed and also to the gentiles who have care for the house of israel that realize and know from whence their blessings come for i know that such will sorrow for the calamity of the house of israel yea they will sorrow for the destruction of this people they will sorrow that this people had not repented that they might have been clasped in the arms of jesus now these things are written unto the remnant of the house of jacob and they are written after this manner because it is known of god that wickedness will not bring them forth unto them and they are to be hid up unto the lord that they may come forth in his own
