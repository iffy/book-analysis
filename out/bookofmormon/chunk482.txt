us neither did antipus overtake them therefore we did camp for the night and it came to pass that before the dawn of the morning behold the lamanites were pursuing us now we were not sufficiently strong to contend with them yea i would not suffer that my little sons should fall into their hands therefore we did continue our march and we took our march into the wilderness now they durst not turn to the right nor to the left lest they should be surrounded neither would i turn to the right nor to the left lest they should overtake me and we could not stand against them but be slain and they would make their escape and thus we did flee all that day into the wilderness even until it was dark and it came to pass that again when the light of the morning came we saw the lamanites upon us and we did flee before them but it came to pass that they did not pursue us far before they halted and it was in the morning of the third day of the seventh month and now whether they were overtaken by antipus we knew not but i said unto my men behold we know not but they have halted for the purpose that we should come against them that they might catch us in their snare therefore what say ye my sons will ye go against them to battle and now i say unto you my beloved brother moroni that never had i seen so great courage nay not amongst all the nephites for as i had ever called them my sons for they were all of them very young even so they said unto me father behold our god is with us and he will not suffer that we should fall then let us go forth we would not slay our brethren if they would let us alone therefore let us go lest they should overpower the army of antipus now they never had fought yet they did not fear death and they did think more upon the liberty of their fathers than they did upon their lives
