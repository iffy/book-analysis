the king said unto them arise for i will grant unto you your lives and i will not suffer that ye shall be my servants but i will insist that ye shall administer unto me for i have been somewhat troubled in mind because of the generosity and the greatness of the words of thy brother ammon and i desire to know the cause why he has not come up out of middoni with thee and aaron said unto the king behold the spirit of the lord has called him another way he has gone to the land of ishmael to teach the people of lamoni now the king said unto them what is this that ye have said concerning the spirit of the lord behold this is the thing which doth trouble me and also what is this that ammon said if ye will repent ye shall be saved and if ye will not repent ye shall be cast off at the last day and aaron answered him and said unto him believest thou that there is a god and the king said i know that the amalekites say that there is a god and i have granted unto them that they should build sanctuaries that they may assemble themselves together to worship him and if now thou sayest there is a god behold i will believe and now when aaron heard this his heart began to rejoice and he said behold assuredly as thou livest o king there is a god and the king said is god that great spirit that brought our fathers out of the land of jerusalem and aaron said unto him yea he is that great spirit and he created all things both in heaven and in earth believest thou this and he said yea i believe that the great spirit created all things and i desire that ye should tell me concerning all these things and i will believe thy words and it came to pass that when aaron saw that the king would believe his words he began from the creation of adam reading the scriptures unto the king how god created man after his own
