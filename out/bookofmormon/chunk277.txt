the first time that priestcraft has been introduced among this people and behold thou art not only guilty of priestcraft but hast endeavored to enforce it by the sword and were priestcraft to be enforced among this people it would prove their entire destruction and thou hast shed the blood of a righteous man yea a man who has done much good among this people and were we to spare thee his blood would come upon us for vengeance therefore thou art condemned to die according to the law which has been given us by mosiah our last king and it has been acknowledged by this people therefore this people must abide by the law and it came to pass that they took him and his name was nehor and they carried him upon the top of the hill manti and there he was caused or rather did acknowledge between the heavens and the earth that what he had taught to the people was contrary to the word of god and there he suffered an ignominious death nevertheless this did not put an end to the spreading of priestcraft through the land for there were many who loved the vain things of the world and they went forth preaching false doctrines and this they did for the sake of riches and honor nevertheless they durst not lie if it were known for fear of the law for liars were punished therefore they pretended to preach according to their belief and now the law could have no power on any man for his belief and they durst not steal for fear of the law for such were punished neither durst they rob nor murder for he that murdered was punished unto death but it came to pass that whosoever did not belong to the church of god began to persecute those that did belong to the church of god and had taken upon them the name of christ yea they did persecute them and afflict them with all manner of words and this because of their humility because they were not proud in their own eyes and because they did impart the word of god
