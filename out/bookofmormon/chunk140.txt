one shall say unto the other behold i i am the lords and the others shall say i i am the lords and thus shall every one say that hath built up churches and not unto the lord and they shall contend one with another and their priests shall contend one with another and they shall teach with their learning and deny the holy ghost which giveth utterance and they deny the power of god the holy one of israel and they say unto the people hearken unto us and hear ye our precept for behold there is no god today for the lord and the redeemer hath done his work and he hath given his power unto men behold hearken ye unto my precept if they shall say there is a miracle wrought by the hand of the lord believe it not for this day he is not a god of miracles he hath done his work yea and there shall be many which shall say eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die and it shall be well with us and there shall also be many which shall say eat drink and be merry nevertheless fear god he will justify in committing a little sin yea lie a little take the advantage of one because of his words dig a pit for thy neighbor there is no harm in this and do all these things for tomorrow we die and if it so be that we are guilty god will beat us with a few stripes and at last we shall be saved in the kingdom of god yea and there shall be many which shall teach after this manner false and vain and foolish doctrines and shall be puffed up in their hearts and shall seek deep to hide their counsels from the lord and their works shall be in the dark and the blood of the saints shall cry from the ground against them yea they have all gone out of the way they have become corrupted because of pride and because of false teachers and false doctrine their churches have become corrupted and their churches are lifted up
