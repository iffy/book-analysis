them and he saith repent and i will receive you yea he saith come unto me and ye shall partake of the fruit of the tree of life yea ye shall eat and drink of the bread and the waters of life freely yea come unto me and bring forth works of righteousness and ye shall not be hewn down and cast into the fire for behold the time is at hand that whosoever bringeth forth not good fruit or whosoever doeth not the works of righteousness the same have cause to wail and mourn o ye workers of iniquity ye that are puffed up in the vain things of the world ye that have professed to have known the ways of righteousness nevertheless have gone astray as sheep having no shepherd notwithstanding a shepherd hath called after you and is still calling after you but ye will not hearken unto his voice behold i say unto you that the good shepherd doth call you yea and in his own name he doth call you which is the name of christ and if ye will not hearken unto the voice of the good shepherd to the name by which ye are called behold ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd and now if ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd of what fold are ye behold i say unto you that the devil is your shepherd and ye are of his fold and now who can deny this behold i say unto you whosoever denieth this is a liar and a child of the devil for i say unto you that whatsoever is good cometh from god and whatsoever is evil cometh from the devil therefore if a man bringeth forth good works he hearkeneth unto the voice of the good shepherd and he doth follow him but whosoever bringeth forth evil works the same becometh a child of the devil for he hearkeneth unto his voice and doth follow him and whosoever doeth this must receive his wages of him therefore for his wages he receiveth death as to things pertaining unto righteousness being dead unto all good works
