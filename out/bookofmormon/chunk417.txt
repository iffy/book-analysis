know that ye deny it behold this is a sin which is unpardonable yea and whosoever murdereth against the light and knowledge of god it is not easy for him to obtain forgiveness yea i say unto you my son that it is not easy for him to obtain a forgiveness and now my son i would to god that ye had not been guilty of so great a crime i would not dwell upon your crimes to harrow up your soul if it were not for your good but behold ye cannot hide your crimes from god and except ye repent they will stand as a testimony against you at the last day now my son i would that ye should repent and forsake your sins and go no more after the lusts of your eyes but cross yourself in all these things for except ye do this ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of god oh remember and take it upon you and cross yourself in these things and i command you to take it upon you to counsel with your elder brothers in your undertakings for behold thou art in thy youth and ye stand in need to be nourished by your brothers and give heed to their counsel suffer not yourself to be led away by any vain or foolish thing suffer not the devil to lead away your heart again after those wicked harlots behold o my son how great iniquity ye brought upon the zoramites for when they saw your conduct they would not believe in my words and now the spirit of the lord doth say unto me command thy children to do good lest they lead away the hearts of many people to destruction therefore i command you my son in the fear of god that ye refrain from your iniquities that ye turn to the lord with all your mind might and strength that ye lead away the hearts of no more to do wickedly but rather return unto them and acknowledge your faults and that wrong which ye have done seek not after riches nor the vain things of this world for behold
