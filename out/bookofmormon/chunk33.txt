spirit of god that it wrought upon other gentiles and they went forth out of captivity upon the many waters and it came to pass that i beheld many multitudes of the gentiles upon the land of promise and i beheld the wrath of god that it was upon the seed of my brethren and they were scattered before the gentiles and were smitten and i beheld the spirit of the lord that it was upon the gentiles and they did prosper and obtain the land for their inheritance and i beheld that they were white and exceedingly fair and beautiful like unto my people before they were slain and it came to pass that i nephi beheld that the gentiles who had gone forth out of captivity did humble themselves before the lord and the power of the lord was with them and i beheld that their mother gentiles were gathered together upon the waters and upon the land also to battle against them and i beheld that the power of god was with them and also that the wrath of god was upon all those that were gathered together against them to battle and i nephi beheld that the gentiles that had gone out of captivity were delivered by the power of god out of the hands of all other nations and it came to pass that i nephi beheld that they did prosper in the land and i beheld a book and it was carried forth among them and the angel said unto me knowest thou the meaning of the book and i said unto him i know not and he said behold it proceedeth out of the mouth of a jew and i nephi beheld it and he said unto me the book that thou beholdest is a record of the jews which contains the covenants of the lord which he hath made unto the house of israel and it also containeth many of the prophecies of the holy prophets and it is a record like unto the engravings which are upon the plates of brass save there are not so many nevertheless they contain the covenants of the lord
