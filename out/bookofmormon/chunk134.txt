it shall be at an instant suddenly and it shall come to pass that those who have dwindled in unbelief shall be smitten by the hand of the gentiles and the gentiles are lifted up in the pride of their eyes and have stumbled because of the greatness of their stumbling block that they have built up many churches nevertheless they put down the power and miracles of god and preach up unto themselves their own wisdom and their own learning that they may get gain and grind upon the face of the poor and there are many churches built up which cause envyings and strifes and malice and there are also secret combinations even as in times of old according to the combinations of the devil for he is the founder of all these things yea the founder of murder and works of darkness yea and he leadeth them by the neck with a flaxen cord until he bindeth them with his strong cords forever for behold my beloved brethren i say unto you that the lord god worketh not in darkness he doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world for he loveth the world even that he layeth down his own life that he may draw all men unto him wherefore he commandeth none that they shall not partake of his salvation behold doth he cry unto any saying depart from me behold i say unto you nay but he saith come unto me all ye ends of the earth buy milk and honey without money and without price behold hath he commanded any that they should depart out of the synagogues or out of the houses of worship behold i say unto you nay hath he commanded any that they should not partake of his salvation behold i say unto you nay but he hath given it free for all men and he hath commanded his people that they should persuade all men to repentance behold hath the lord commanded any that they should not partake of his goodness behold i say unto you nay but all men are privileged the one like unto the other
