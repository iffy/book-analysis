a king or kings to rule over you for behold how much iniquity doth one wicked king cause to be committed yea and what great destruction yea remember king noah his wickedness and his abominations and also the wickedness and abominations of his people behold what great destruction did come upon them and also because of their iniquities they were brought into bondage and were it not for the interposition of their all-wise creator and this because of their sincere repentance they must unavoidably remain in bondage until now but behold he did deliver them because they did humble themselves before him and because they cried mightily unto him he did deliver them out of bondage and thus doth the lord work with his power in all cases among the children of men extending the arm of mercy towards them that put their trust in him and behold now i say unto you ye cannot dethrone an iniquitous king save it be through much contention and the shedding of much blood for behold he has his friends in iniquity and he keepeth his guards about him and he teareth up the laws of those who have reigned in righteousness before him and he trampleth under his feet the commandments of god and he enacteth laws and sendeth them forth among his people yea laws after the manner of his own wickedness and whosoever doth not obey his laws he causeth to be destroyed and whosoever doth rebel against him he will send his armies against them to war and if he can he will destroy them and thus an unrighteous king doth pervert the ways of all righteousness and now behold i say unto you it is not expedient that such abominations should come upon you therefore choose you by the voice of this people judges that ye may be judged according to the laws which have been given you by our fathers which are correct and which were given them by the hand of the lord now it is not common that the voice of the people desireth anything contrary to that which is right but it is common for the lesser part
