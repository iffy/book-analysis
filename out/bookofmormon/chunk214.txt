is able to interpret the language or the engravings that are on the plates therefore i said unto thee canst thou translate and i say unto thee again knowest thou of any one that can translate for i am desirous that these records should be translated into our language for perhaps they will give us a knowledge of a remnant of the people who have been destroyed from whence these records came or perhaps they will give us a knowledge of this very people who have been destroyed and i am desirous to know the cause of their destruction now ammon said unto him i can assuredly tell thee o king of a man that can translate the records for he has wherewith that he can look and translate all records that are of ancient date and it is a gift from god and the things are called interpreters and no man can look in them except he be commanded lest he should look for that he ought not and he should perish and whosoever is commanded to look in them the same is called seer and behold the king of the people who are in the land of zarahemla is the man that is commanded to do these things and who has this high gift from god and the king said that a seer is greater than a prophet and ammon said that a seer is a revelator and a prophet also and a gift which is greater can no man have except he should possess the power of god which no man can yet a man may have great power given him from god but a seer can know of things which are past and also of things which are to come and by them shall all things be revealed or rather shall secret things be made manifest and hidden things shall come to light and things which are not known shall be made known by them and also things shall be made known by them which otherwise could not be known thus god has provided a means that man through faith might work mighty miracles therefore he becometh a great benefit
