shall the fulness of the gospel of the messiah come unto the gentiles and from the gentiles unto the remnant of our seed and at that day shall the remnant of our seed know that they are of the house of israel and that they are the covenant people of the lord and then shall they know and come to the knowledge of their forefathers and also to the knowledge of the gospel of their redeemer which was ministered unto their fathers by him wherefore they shall come to the knowledge of their redeemer and the very points of his doctrine that they may know how to come unto him and be saved and then at that day will they not rejoice and give praise unto their everlasting god their rock and their salvation yea at that day will they not receive the strength and nourishment from the true vine yea will they not come unto the true fold of god behold i say unto you yea they shall be remembered again among the house of israel they shall be grafted in being a natural branch of the olive-tree into the true olive-tree and this is what our father meaneth and he meaneth that it will not come to pass until after they are scattered by the gentiles and he meaneth that it shall come by way of the gentiles that the lord may show his power unto the gentiles for the very cause that he shall be rejected of the jews or of the house of israel wherefore our father hath not spoken of our seed alone but also of all the house of israel pointing to the covenant which should be fulfilled in the latter days which covenant the lord made to our father abraham saying in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed and it came to pass that i nephi spake much unto them concerning these things yea i spake unto them concerning the restoration of the jews in the latter days and i did rehearse unto them the words of isaiah who spake concerning the restoration of the jews or of the house of israel
