fled to the camp of moroni and appealed unto him for assistance for behold they were not in the wrong and it came to pass that when the people of morianton who were led by a man whose name was morianton found that the people of lehi had fled to the camp of moroni they were exceedingly fearful lest the army of moroni should come upon them and destroy them therefore morianton put it into their hearts that they should flee to the land which was northward which was covered with large bodies of water and take possession of the land which was northward and behold they would have carried this plan into effect which would have been a cause to have been lamented but behold morianton being a man of much passion therefore he was angry with one of his maid servants and he fell upon her and beat her much and it came to pass that she fled and came over to the camp of moroni and told moroni all things concerning the matter and also concerning their intentions to flee into the land northward now behold the people who were in the land bountiful or rather moroni feared that they would hearken to the words of morianton and unite with his people and thus he would obtain possession of those parts of the land which would lay a foundation for serious consequences among the people of nephi yea which consequences would lead to the overthrow of their liberty therefore moroni sent an army with their camp to head the people of morianton to stop their flight into the land northward and it came to pass that they did not head them until they had come to the borders of the land desolation and there they did head them by the narrow pass which led by the sea into the land northward yea by the sea on the west and on the east and it came to pass that the army which was sent by moroni which was led by a man whose name was teancum did meet the people of morianton and so stubborn were the people of morianton being inspired
