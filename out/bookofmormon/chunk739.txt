ye shall see me at the bar of god and the lord god will say unto you did i not declare my words unto you which were written by this man like as one crying from the dead yea even as one speaking out of the dust i declare these things unto the fulfilling of the prophecies and behold they shall proceed forth out of the mouth of the everlasting god and his word shall hiss forth from generation to generation and god shall show unto you that that which i have written is true and again i would exhort you that ye would come unto christ and lay hold upon every good gift and touch not the evil gift nor the unclean thing and awake and arise from the dust o jerusalem yea and put on thy beautiful garments o daughter of zion and strengthen thy stakes and enlarge thy borders forever that thou mayest no more be confounded that the covenants of the eternal father which he hath made unto thee o house of israel may be fulfilled yea come unto christ and be perfected in him and deny yourselves of all ungodliness and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness and love god with all your might mind and strength then is his grace sufficient for you that by his grace ye may be perfect in christ and if by the grace of god ye are perfect in christ ye can in nowise deny the power of god and again if ye by the grace of god are perfect in christ and deny not his power then are ye sanctified in christ by the grace of god through the shedding of the blood of christ which is in the covenant of the father unto the remission of your sins that ye become holy without spot and now i bid unto all farewell i soon go to rest in the paradise of god until my spirit and body shall again reunite and i am brought forth triumphant through the air to meet you before the pleasing bar of the great jehovah the eternal judge of both quick and dead amen
