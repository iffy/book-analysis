be that travel therein until the night cometh wherein no man can work nephi chapter and it came to pass when jesus had said these words he spake unto his disciples one by one saying unto them what is it that ye desire of me after that i am gone to the father and they all spake save it were three saying we desire that after we have lived unto the age of man that our ministry wherein thou hast called us may have an end that we may speedily come unto thee in thy kingdom and he said unto them blessed are ye because ye desired this thing of me therefore after that ye are seventy and two years old ye shall come unto me in my kingdom and with me ye shall find rest and when he had spoken unto them he turned himself unto the three and said unto them what will ye that i should do unto you when i am gone unto the father and they sorrowed in their hearts for they durst not speak unto him the things which they desired and he said unto them behold i know your thoughts and ye have desired the thing which john my beloved who was with me in my ministry before that i was lifted up by the jews desired of me therefore more blessed are ye for ye shall never taste of death but ye shall live to behold all the doings of the father unto the children of men even until all things shall be fulfilled according to the will of the father when i shall come in my glory with the powers of heaven and ye shall never endure the pains of death but when i shall come in my glory ye shall be changed in the twinkling of an eye from mortality to immortality and then shall ye be blessed in the kingdom of my father and again ye shall not have pain while ye shall dwell in the flesh neither sorrow save it be for the sins of the world and all this will i do because of the thing which ye have desired
