pitched their tents in the valley of corihor and coriantumr pitched his tents in the valley of shurr now the valley of shurr was near the hill comnor wherefore coriantumr did gather his armies together upon the hill comnor and did sound a trumpet unto the armies of shiz to invite them forth to battle and it came to pass that they came forth but were driven again and they came the second time and they were driven again the second time and it came to pass that they came again the third time and the battle became exceedingly sore and it came to pass that shiz smote upon coriantumr that he gave him many deep wounds and coriantumr having lost his blood fainted and was carried away as though he were dead now the loss of men women and children on both sides was so great that shiz commanded his people that they should not pursue the armies of coriantumr wherefore they returned to their camp ether chapter and it came to pass when coriantumr had recovered of his wounds he began to remember the words which ether had spoken unto him he saw that there had been slain by the sword already nearly two millions of his people and he began to sorrow in his heart yea there had been slain two millions of mighty men and also their wives and their children he began to repent of the evil which he had done he began to remember the words which had been spoken by the mouth of all the prophets and he saw them that they were fulfilled thus far every whit and his soul mourned and refused to be comforted and it came to pass that he wrote an epistle unto shiz desiring him that he would spare the people and he would give up the kingdom for the sake of the lives of the people and it came to pass that when shiz had received his epistle he wrote an epistle unto coriantumr that if he would give himself up that he might slay him with his own sword that he would spare the lives of the people
