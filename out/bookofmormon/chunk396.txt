have tasted this light is your knowledge perfect behold i say unto you nay neither must ye lay aside your faith for ye have only exercised your faith to plant the seed that ye might try the experiment to know if the seed was good and behold as the tree beginneth to grow ye will say let us nourish it with great care that it may get root that it may grow up and bring forth fruit unto us and now behold if ye nourish it with much care it will get root and grow up and bring forth fruit but if ye neglect the tree and take no thought for its nourishment behold it will not get any root and when the heat of the sun cometh and scorcheth it because it hath no root it withers away and ye pluck it up and cast it out now this is not because the seed was not good neither is it because the fruit thereof would not be desirable but it is because your ground is barren and ye will not nourish the tree therefore ye cannot have the fruit thereof and thus if ye will not nourish the word looking forward with an eye of faith to the fruit thereof ye can never pluck of the fruit of the tree of life but if ye will nourish the word yea nourish the tree as it beginneth to grow by your faith with great diligence and with patience looking forward to the fruit thereof it shall take root and behold it shall be a tree springing up unto everlasting life and because of your diligence and your faith and your patience with the word in nourishing it that it may take root in you behold by and by ye shall pluck the fruit thereof which is most precious which is sweet above all that is sweet and which is white above all that is white yea and pure above all that is pure and ye shall feast upon this fruit even until ye are filled that ye hunger not neither shall ye thirst then my brethren ye shall reap the rewards of your faith
