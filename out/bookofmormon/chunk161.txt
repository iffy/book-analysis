that we knew of christ and we had a hope of his glory many hundred years before his coming and not only we ourselves had a hope of his glory but also all the holy prophets which were before us behold they believed in christ and worshiped the father in his name and also we worship the father in his name and for this intent we keep the law of moses it pointing our souls to him and for this cause it is sanctified unto us for righteousness even as it was accounted unto abraham in the wilderness to be obedient unto the commands of god in offering up his son isaac which is a similitude of god and his only begotten son wherefore we search the prophets and we have many revelations and the spirit of prophecy and having all these witnesses we obtain a hope and our faith becometh unshaken insomuch that we truly can command in the name of jesus and the very trees obey us or the mountains or the waves of the sea nevertheless the lord god showeth us our weakness that we may know that it is by his grace and his great condescensions unto the children of men that we have power to do these things behold great and marvelous are the works of the lord how unsearchable are the depths of the mysteries of him and it is impossible that man should find out all his ways and no man knoweth of his ways save it be revealed unto him wherefore brethren despise not the revelations of god for behold by the power of his word man came upon the face of the earth which earth was created by the power of his word wherefore if god being able to speak and the world was and to speak and man was created o then why not able to command the earth or the workmanship of his hands upon the face of it according to his will and pleasure wherefore brethren seek not to counsel the lord but to take counsel from his hand for behold ye yourselves know that he counseleth in wisdom and in justice
