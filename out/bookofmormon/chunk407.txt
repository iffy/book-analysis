commandments yea and i had murdered many of his children or rather led them away unto destruction yea and in fine so great had been my iniquities that the very thought of coming into the presence of my god did rack my soul with inexpressible horror oh thought i that i could be banished and become extinct both soul and body that i might not be brought to stand in the presence of my god to be judged of my deeds and now for three days and for three nights was i racked even with the pains of a damned soul and it came to pass that as i was thus racked with torment while i was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins behold i remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one jesus christ a son of god to atone for the sins of the world now as my mind caught hold upon this thought i cried within my heart o jesus thou son of god have mercy on me who am in the gall of bitterness and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death and now behold when i thought this i could remember my pains no more yea i was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more and oh what joy and what marvelous light i did behold yea my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain yea i say unto you my son that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains yea and again i say unto you my son that on the other hand there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy yea methought i saw even as our father lehi saw god sitting upon his throne surrounded with numberless concourses of angels in the attitude of singing and praising their god yea and my soul did long to be there but behold my limbs did receive their strength again and i stood upon my feet and did manifest unto the people that i had been born of god
