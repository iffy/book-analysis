to pass that they had gathered themselves together upon the top of the mount which was called antipas in preparation to battle now it was not amalickiahs intention to give them battle according to the commandments of the king but behold it was his intention to gain favor with the armies of the lamanites that he might place himself at their head and dethrone the king and take possession of the kingdom and behold it came to pass that he caused his army to pitch their tents in the valley which was near the mount antipas and it came to pass that when it was night he sent a secret embassy into the mount antipas desiring that the leader of those who were upon the mount whose name was lehonti that he should come down to the foot of the mount for he desired to speak with him and it came to pass that when lehonti received the message he durst not go down to the foot of the mount and it came to pass that amalickiah sent again the second time desiring him to come down and it came to pass that lehonti would not and he sent again the third time and it came to pass that when amalickiah found that he could not get lehonti to come down off from the mount he went up into the mount nearly to lehontis camp and he sent again the fourth time his message unto lehonti desiring that he would come down and that he would bring his guards with him and it came to pass that when lehonti had come down with his guards to amalickiah that amalickiah desired him to come down with his army in the night-time and surround those men in their camps over whom the king had given him command and that he would deliver them up into lehontis hands if he would make him amalickiah a second leader over the whole army and it came to pass that lehonti came down with his men and surrounded the men of amalickiah so that before they awoke at the dawn of day they were surrounded by the armies of lehonti
