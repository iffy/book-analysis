view by the large chestnut-trees which on all sides spread their luxuriant branches we shall find some people of our acquaintance this time maximilian was the first to arrive he was intently watching for a shadow to appear among the trees and awaiting with anxiety the sound of a light step on the gravel walk at length the long-desired sound was heard and instead of one figure as he had expected he perceived that two were approaching him the delay had been occasioned by a visit from madame danglars and eugnie which had been prolonged beyond the time at which valentine was expected that she might not appear to fail in her promise to maximilian she proposed to mademoiselle danglars that they should take a walk in the garden being anxious to show that the delay which was doubtless a cause of vexation to him was not occasioned by any neglect on her part the young man with the intuitive perception of a lover quickly understood the circumstances in which she was involuntarily placed and he was comforted besides although she avoided coming within speaking distance valentine arranged so that maximilian could see her pass and repass and each time she went by she managed unperceived by her companion to cast an expressive look at the young man which seemed to say have patience you see it is not my fault and maximilian was patient and employed himself in mentally contrasting the two girls one fair with soft languishing eyes a figure gracefully bending like a weeping willow the other a brunette with a fierce and haughty expression and as straight as a poplar it is unnecessary to state that in the eyes of the young man valentine did not suffer by the contrast in about half an hour the girls went away and maximilian understood that mademoiselle danglars visit had at last come to an end in a few minutes valentine re-entered the garden alone for fear that anyone should be observing her return she walked slowly and instead of immediately directing her steps towards the gate she seated herself on a bench and carefully casting her eyes around to convince herself that she was not watched she presently arose and proceeded quickly to join maximilian good-evening valentine said a well-known voice good-evening maximilian i know i have kept you waiting but you saw the cause of my delay yes i recognized mademoiselle danglars i was not aware that you were so intimate with her who told you we were intimate maximilian no one but you appeared to be so from the manner in which you walked and talked together one would have thought you were two school-girls telling your secrets to each other we were having a confidential conversation returned valentine she was owning to me her repugnance to the marriage with m de morcerf and i on the other hand was confessing to her how wretched it made me to think of marrying m dpinay dear valentine that will account to you for the unreserved manner which you observed between me and eugnie as in speaking of the man whom i could not love my thoughts involuntarily reverted to him on whom my affections were fixed ah how good you are to say so valentine you possess a quality which can never belong to mademoiselle danglars it is that indefinable charm which is to a woman what perfume is to the flower and flavor to the fruit for the beauty of either is not the only quality we seek it is your love which makes you look upon everything in that light no valentine i assure you such is not the case i was observing you both when you were walking in
