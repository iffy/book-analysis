cristo it is unnecessary we know each other so well on the contrary said the count we know so little of each other indeed said monte cristo with the same indomitable coolness let us see are you not the soldier fernand who deserted on the eve of the battle of waterloo are you not the lieutenant fernand who served as guide and spy to the french army in spain are you not the captain fernand who betrayed sold and murdered his benefactor ali and have not all these fernands united made lieutenant-general the count of morcerf peer of france oh cried the general as if branded with a hot iron wretch to reproach me with my shame when about perhaps to kill me no i did not say i was a stranger to you i know well demon that you have penetrated into the darkness of the past and that you have read by the light of what torch i know not every page of my life but perhaps i may be more honorable in my shame than you under your pompous coverings no no i am aware you know me but i know you only as an adventurer sewn up in gold and jewellery you call yourself in paris the count of monte cristo in italy sinbad the sailor in malta i forget what but it is your real name i want to know in the midst of your hundred names that i may pronounce it when we meet to fight at the moment when i plunge my sword through your heart the count of monte cristo turned dreadfully pale his eye seemed to burn with a devouring fire he leaped towards a dressing-room near his bedroom and in less than a moment tearing off his cravat his coat and waistcoat he put on a sailors jacket and hat from beneath which rolled his long black hair he returned thus formidable and implacable advancing with his arms crossed on his breast towards the general who could not understand why he had disappeared but who on seeing him again and feeling his teeth chatter and his legs sink under him drew back and only stopped when he found a table to support his clenched hand fernand cried he of my hundred names i need only tell you one to overwhelm you but you guess it now do you not or rather you remember it for notwithstanding all my sorrows and my tortures i show you today a face which the happiness of revenge makes young again a face you must often have seen in your dreams since your marriage with mercds my betrothed m the general with his head thrown back hands extended gaze fixed looked silently at this dreadful apparition then seeking the wall to support him he glided along close to it until he reached the door through which he went out backwards uttering this single mournful lamentable distressing cry edmond dants then with sighs which were unlike any human sound he dragged himself to the door reeled across the courtyard and falling into the arms of his valet he said in a voice scarcely intelligible home home the fresh air and the shame he felt at having exposed himself before his servants partly recalled his senses but the ride was short and as he drew near his house all his wretchedness revived he stopped at a short distance from the house and alighted the door was wide open a hackney-coach was standing in the middle of the yard a strange sight before so noble a mansion the count looked at it with terror but without daring to inquire its meaning he rushed towards his apartment two persons were coming down the stairs
