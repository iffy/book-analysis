what i say in this my dying moment the treasure of the spadas exists god grants me the boon of vision unrestricted by time or space i see it in the depths of the inner cavern my eyes pierce the inmost recesses of the earth and are dazzled at the sight of so much riches if you do escape remember that the poor abb whom all the world called mad was not so hasten to monte cristo avail yourself of the fortune for you have indeed suffered long enough a violent convulsion attacked the old man dants raised his head and saw farias eyes injected with blood it seemed as if a flow of blood had ascended from the chest to the head adieu adieu murmured the old man clasping edmonds hand convulsively adieu oh no no not yet he cried do not forsake me oh succor him help help help hush hush murmured the dying man that they may not separate us if you save me you are right oh yes yes be assured i shall save you besides although you suffer much you do not seem to be in such agony as you were before do not mistake i suffer less because there is in me less strength to endure at your age we have faith in life it is the privilege of youth to believe and hope but old men see death more clearly oh tis here tis here tis over my sight is gone my senses fail your hand dants adieu adieu and raising himself by a final effort in which he summoned all his faculties he said monte cristo forget not monte cristo and he fell back on the bed the crisis was terrible and a rigid form with twisted limbs swollen eyelids and lips flecked with bloody foam lay on the bed of torture in place of the intellectual being who so lately rested there dants took the lamp placed it on a projecting stone above the bed whence its tremulous light fell with strange and fantastic ray on the distorted countenance and motionless stiffened body with steady gaze he awaited confidently the moment for administering the restorative when he believed that the right moment had arrived he took the knife pried open the teeth which offered less resistance than before counted one after the other twelve drops and watched the phial contained perhaps twice as much more he waited ten minutes a quarter of an hour half an hour no change took place trembling his hair erect his brow bathed with perspiration he counted the seconds by the beating of his heart then he thought it was time to make the last trial and he put the phial to the purple lips of faria and without having occasion to force open his jaws which had remained extended he poured the whole of the liquid down his throat m the draught produced a galvanic effect a violent trembling pervaded the old mans limbs his eyes opened until it was fearful to gaze upon them he heaved a sigh which resembled a shriek and then his convulsed body returned gradually to its former immobility the eyes remaining open half an hour an hour an hour and a half elapsed and during this period of anguish edmond leaned over his friend his hand applied to his heart and felt the body gradually grow cold and the hearts pulsation become more and more deep and dull until at length it stopped the last movement of the heart ceased the face became livid the eyes remained open but the eyeballs were glazed it was six oclock in the morning the dawn was just breaking and its feeble ray came into the dungeon and
