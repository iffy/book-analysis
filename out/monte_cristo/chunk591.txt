distinctly oh mercds i have uttered your name with the sigh of melancholy with the groan of sorrow with the last effort of despair i have uttered it when frozen with cold crouched on the straw in my dungeon i have uttered it consumed with heat rolling on the stone floor of my prison mercds i must revenge myself for i suffered fourteen years fourteen years i wept i cursed now i tell you mercds i must revenge myself the count fearing to yield to the entreaties of her he had so ardently loved called his sufferings to the assistance of his hatred revenge yourself then edmond cried the poor mother but let your vengeance fall on the culprits on him on me but not on my son it is written in the good book said monte cristo that the sins of the fathers shall fall upon their children to the third and fourth generation since god himself dictated those words to his prophet why should i seek to make myself better than god edmond continued mercds with her arms extended towards the count since i first knew you i have adored your name have respected your memory edmond my friend do not compel me to tarnish that noble and pure image reflected incessantly on the mirror of my heart edmond if you knew all the prayers i have addressed to god for you while i thought you were living and since i have thought you must be dead yes dead alas i imagined your dead body buried at the foot of some gloomy tower or cast to the bottom of a pit by hateful jailers and i wept what could i do for you edmond besides pray and weep listen for ten years i dreamed each night the same dream i had been told that you had endeavored to escape that you had taken the place of another prisoner that you had slipped into the winding sheet of a dead body that you had been thrown alive from the top of the chteau dif and that the cry you uttered as you dashed upon the rocks first revealed to your jailers that they were your murderers well edmond i swear to you by the head of that son for whom i entreat your pity edmond for ten years i saw every night every detail of that frightful tragedy and for ten years i heard every night the cry which awoke me shuddering and cold and i too edmond oh believe me guilty as i was oh yes i too have suffered much have you known what it is to have your father starve to death in your absence cried monte cristo thrusting his hands into his hair have you seen the woman you loved giving her hand to your rival while you were perishing at the bottom of a dungeon no interrupted mercds but i have seen him whom i loved on the point of murdering my son mercds uttered these words with such deep anguish with an accent of such intense despair that monte cristo could not restrain a sob the lion was daunted the avenger was conquered what do you ask of me said he your sons life well he shall live mercds uttered a cry which made the tears start from monte cristos eyes but these tears disappeared almost instantaneously for doubtless god had sent some angel to collect them far more precious were they in his eyes than the richest pearls of guzerat and ophir oh said she seizing the counts hand and raising it to her lips oh thank you thank you edmond now you are exactly what i dreamt you were the man i always loved oh now
