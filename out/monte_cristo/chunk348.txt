he did not credit it at the period which i knew him said monte cristo touched to the heart by the accents of julies voice but perhaps since then he has had proofs that gratitude does exist and do you know this gentleman monsieur inquired emmanuel oh if you do know him cried julie can you tell us where he is where we can find him maximilian emmanuel if we do but discover him he must believe in the gratitude of the heart monte cristo felt tears start into his eyes and he again walked hastily up and down the room in the name of heaven said maximilian if you know anything of him tell us what it is alas cried monte cristo striving to repress his emotion if lord wilmore was your unknown benefactor i fear you will never see him again i parted from him two years ago at palermo and he was then on the point of setting out for the most remote regions so that i fear he will never return oh monsieur this is cruel of you said julie much affected and the young ladys eyes swam with tears madame replied monte cristo gravely and gazing earnestly on the two liquid pearls that trickled down julies cheeks had lord wilmore seen what i now see he would become attached to life for the tears you shed would reconcile him to mankind and he held out his hand to julie who gave him hers carried away by the look and accent of the count but continued she lord wilmore had a family or friends he must have known someone can we not oh it is useless to inquire returned the count perhaps after all he was not the man you seek for he was my friend he had no secrets from me and if this had been so he would have confided in me and he told you nothing not a word nothing that would lead you to suppose nothing and yet you spoke of him at once ah in such a case one supposes sister sister said maximilian coming to the counts aid monsieur is quite right recollect what our excellent father so often told us it was no englishman that thus saved us monte cristo started what did your father tell you m morrel said he eagerly my father thought that this action had been miraculously performed he believed that a benefactor had arisen from the grave to save us oh it was a touching superstition monsieur and although i did not myself believe it i would not for the world have destroyed my fathers faith how often did he muse over it and pronounce the name of a dear friend a friend lost to him forever and on his death-bed when the near approach of eternity seemed to have illumined his mind with supernatural light this thought which had until then been but a doubt became a conviction and his last words were maximilian it was edmond dants at these words the counts paleness which had for some time been increasing became alarming he could not speak he looked at his watch like a man who has forgotten the hour said a few hurried words to madame herbault and pressing the hands of emmanuel and maximilian madame said he i trust you will allow me to visit you occasionally i value your friendship and feel grateful to you for your welcome for this is the first time for many years that i have thus yielded to my feelings and he hastily quitted the apartment this count of monte cristo is a strange man said emmanuel yes answered maximilian but i feel sure he has an excellent heart and
