gigantic dimensions of the majestic ruin franz had remained for nearly a quarter of an hour perfectly hidden by the shadow of the vast column at whose base he had found a resting-place and from whence his eyes followed the motions of albert and his guides who holding torches in their hands had emerged from a vomitorium at the opposite extremity of the colosseum and then again disappeared down the steps conducting to the seats reserved for the vestal virgins resembling as they glided along some restless shades following the flickering glare of so many ignes fatui all at once his ear caught a sound resembling that of a stone rolling down the staircase opposite the one by which he had himself ascended there was nothing remarkable in the circumstance of a fragment of granite giving way and falling heavily below but it seemed to him that the substance that fell gave way beneath the pressure of a foot and also that someone who endeavored as much as possible to prevent his footsteps from being heard was approaching the spot where he sat conjecture soon became certainty for the figure of a man was distinctly visible to franz gradually emerging from the staircase opposite upon which the moon was at that moment pouring a full tide of silvery brightness the stranger thus presenting himself was probably a person who like franz preferred the enjoyment of solitude and his own thoughts to the frivolous gabble of the guides and his appearance had nothing extraordinary in it but the hesitation with which he proceeded stopping and listening with anxious attention at every step he took convinced franz that he expected the arrival of some person by a sort of instinctive impulse franz withdrew as much as possible behind his pillar about ten feet from the spot where he and the stranger were the roof had given way leaving a large round opening through which might be seen the blue vault of heaven thickly studded with stars around this opening which had possibly for ages permitted a free entrance to the brilliant moonbeams that now illumined the vast pile grew a quantity of creeping plants whose delicate green branches stood out in bold relief against the clear azure of the firmament while large masses of thick strong fibrous shoots forced their way through the chasm and hung floating to and fro like so many waving strings the person whose mysterious arrival had attracted the attention of franz stood in a kind of half-light that rendered it impossible to distinguish his features although his dress was easily made out he wore a large brown mantle one fold of which thrown over his left shoulder served likewise to mask the lower part of his countenance while the upper part was completely hidden by his broad-brimmed hat the lower part of his dress was more distinctly visible by the bright rays of the moon which entering through the broken ceiling shed their refulgent beams on feet cased in elegantly made boots of polished leather over which descended fashionably cut trousers of black cloth m from the imperfect means franz had of judging he could only come to one conclusion that the person whom he was thus watching certainly belonged to no inferior station of life some few minutes had elapsed and the stranger began to show manifest signs of impatience when a slight noise was heard outside the aperture in the roof and almost immediately a dark shadow seemed to obstruct the flood of light that had entered it and the figure of a man was clearly seen gazing with eager scrutiny on the immense space beneath him then as his eye caught sight of him in the mantle he grasped
