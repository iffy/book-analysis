of the thieves hes a fine looking fellow said another if he had only a comb and hair-grease hed take the shine off the gentlemen in white kids his coat looks nearly new and his boots are brilliant it is pleasant to have such well-dressed brethren and those gendarmes behaved shamefully what jealousy to tear such clothes he looks like a big-bug said another dresses in fine style and then to be here so young oh what larks meanwhile the object of this hideous admiration approached the wicket against which one of the keepers was leaning come sir he said lend me twenty francs you will soon be paid you run no risks with me remember i have relations who possess more millions than you have deniers come i beseech you lend me twenty francs so that i may buy a dressing-gown it is intolerable always to be in a coat and boots and what a coat sir for a prince of the cavalcanti the keeper turned his back and shrugged his shoulders he did not even laugh at what would have caused anyone else to do so he had heard so many utter the same things indeed he heard nothing else come said andrea you are a man void of compassion ill have you turned out this made the keeper turn around and he burst into a loud laugh the prisoners then approached and formed a circle i tell you that with that wretched sum continued andrea i could obtain a coat and a room in which to receive the illustrious visitor i am daily expecting of course of course said the prisoners anyone can see hes a gentleman well then lend him the twenty francs said the keeper leaning on the other shoulder surely you will not refuse a comrade m i am no comrade of these people said the young man proudly you have no right to insult me thus the thieves looked at one another with low murmurs and a storm gathered over the head of the aristocratic prisoner raised less by his own words than by the manner of the keeper the latter sure of quelling the tempest when the waves became too violent allowed them to rise to a certain pitch that he might be revenged on the importunate andrea and besides it would afford him some recreation during the long day the thieves had already approached andrea some screaming la savate la savate a cruel operation which consists in cuffing a comrade who may have fallen into disgrace not with an old shoe but with an iron-heeled one others proposed the anguille another kind of recreation in which a handkerchief is filled with sand pebbles and two-sous pieces when they have them which the wretches beat like a flail over the head and shoulders of the unhappy sufferer let us horsewhip the fine gentleman said others but andrea turning towards them winked his eyes rolled his tongue around his cheeks and smacked his lips in a manner equivalent to a hundred words among the bandits when forced to be silent it was a masonic sign caderousse had taught him he was immediately recognized as one of them the handkerchief was thrown down and the iron-heeled shoe replaced on the foot of the wretch to whom it belonged some voices were heard to say that the gentleman was right that he intended to be civil in his way and that they would set the example of liberty of conscience and the mob retired the keeper was so stupefied at this scene that he took andrea by the hands and began examining his person attributing the sudden submission of the inmates of the lions den to something more substantial
