the count reached the tower of montlhry situated as everyone knows upon the highest point of the plain of that name at the foot of the hill the count dismounted and began to ascend by a little winding path about eighteen inches wide when he reached the summit he found himself stopped by a hedge upon which green fruit had succeeded to red and white flowers monte cristo looked for the entrance to the enclosure and was not long in finding a little wooden gate working on willow hinges and fastened with a nail and string the count soon mastered the mechanism the gate opened and he then found himself in a little garden about twenty feet long by twelve wide bounded on one side by part of the hedge which contained the ingenious contrivance we have called a gate and on the other by the old tower covered with ivy and studded with wall-flowers no one would have thought in looking at this old weather-beaten floral-decked tower which might be likened to an elderly dame dressed up to receive her grandchildren at a birthday feast that it would have been capable of telling strange things if in addition to the menacing ears which the proverb says all walls are provided with it had also a voice the garden was crossed by a path of red gravel edged by a border of thick box of many years growth and of a tone and color that would have delighted the heart of delacroix our modern rubens this path was formed in the shape of the figure of thus in its windings making a walk of sixty feet in a garden of only twenty never had flora the fresh and smiling goddess of gardeners been honored with a purer or more scrupulous worship than that which was paid to her in this little enclosure in fact of the twenty rose-trees which formed the parterre not one bore the mark of the slug nor were there evidences anywhere of the clustering aphis which is so destructive to plants growing in a damp soil and yet it was not because the damp had been excluded from the garden the earth black as soot the thick foliage of the trees betrayed its presence besides had natural humidity been wanting it could have been immediately supplied by artificial means thanks to a tank of water sunk in one of the corners of the garden and upon which were stationed a frog and a toad who from antipathy no doubt always remained on the two opposite sides of the basin there was not a blade of grass to be seen in the paths or a weed in the flower-beds no fine lady ever trained and watered her geraniums her cacti and her rhododendrons in her porcelain jardinire with more pains than this hitherto unseen gardener bestowed upon his little enclosure monte cristo stopped after having closed the gate and fastened the string to the nail and cast a look around the man at the telegraph said he must either engage a gardener or devote himself passionately to agriculture suddenly he struck against something crouching behind a wheelbarrow filled with leaves the something rose uttering an exclamation of astonishment and monte cristo found himself facing a man about fifty years old who was plucking strawberries which he was placing upon grape leaves he had twelve leaves and about as many strawberries which on rising suddenly he let fall from his hand you are gathering your crop sir said monte cristo smiling m excuse me sir replied the man raising his hand to his cap i am not up there i know but i have only just come down do not let me interfere
