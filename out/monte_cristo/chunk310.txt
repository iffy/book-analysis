threw himself on his bed and i could hear it creak and groan beneath his weight insensibly my eyelids grew heavy deep sleep stole over me and having no suspicion of anything wrong i sought not to shake it off i looked into the kitchen once more and saw caderousse sitting by the side of a long table upon one of the low wooden stools which in country places are frequently used instead of chairs his back was turned towards me so that i could not see the expression of his countenance neither should i have been able to do so had he been placed differently as his head was buried between his two hands la carconte continued to gaze on him for some time then shrugging her shoulders she took her seat immediately opposite to him at this moment the expiring embers threw up a fresh flame from the kindling of a piece of wood that lay near and a bright light flashed over the room la carconte still kept her eyes fixed on her husband but as he made no sign of changing his position she extended her hard bony hand and touched him on the forehead m caderousse shuddered the womans lips seemed to move as though she were talking but because she merely spoke in an undertone or my senses were dulled by sleep i did not catch a word she uttered confused sights and sounds seemed to float before me and gradually i fell into a deep heavy slumber how long i had been in this unconscious state i know not when i was suddenly aroused by the report of a pistol followed by a fearful cry weak and tottering footsteps resounded across the chamber above me and the next instant a dull heavy weight seemed to fall powerless on the staircase i had not yet fully recovered consciousness when again i heard groans mingled with half-stifled cries as if from persons engaged in a deadly struggle a cry more prolonged than the others and ending in a series of groans effectually roused me from my drowsy lethargy hastily raising myself on one arm i looked around but all was dark and it seemed to me as if the rain must have penetrated through the flooring of the room above for some kind of moisture appeared to fall drop by drop upon my forehead and when i passed my hand across my brow i felt that it was wet and clammy to the fearful noises that had awakened me had succeeded the most perfect silence unbroken save by the footsteps of a man walking about in the chamber above the staircase creaked he descended into the room below approached the fire and lit a candle the man was caderousse he was pale and his shirt was all bloody having obtained the light he hurried upstairs again and once more i heard his rapid and uneasy footsteps a moment later he came down again holding in his hand the small shagreen case which he opened to assure himself it contained the diamond seemed to hesitate as to which pocket he should put it in then as if dissatisfied with the security of either pocket he deposited it in his red handkerchief which he carefully rolled round his head after this he took from his cupboard the bank-notes and gold he had put there thrust the one into the pocket of his trousers and the other into that of his waistcoat hastily tied up a small bundle of linen and rushing towards the door disappeared in the darkness of the night then all became clear and manifest to me and i reproached myself with what had happened as though i myself had
