lead edmond concluded that perhaps instead of having reached the end of the route he had only explored its beginning and he therefore turned round and retraced his steps meanwhile his comrades had prepared the repast had got some water from a spring spread out the fruit and bread and cooked the kid just at the moment when they were taking the dainty animal from the spit they saw edmond springing with the boldness of a chamois from rock to rock and they fired the signal agreed upon the sportsman instantly changed his direction and ran quickly towards them but even while they watched his daring progress edmonds foot slipped and they saw him stagger on the edge of a rock and disappear they all rushed towards him for all loved edmond in spite of his superiority yet jacopo reached him first he found edmond lying prone bleeding and almost senseless he had rolled down a declivity of twelve or fifteen feet they poured a little rum down his throat and this remedy which had before been so beneficial to him produced the same effect as formerly edmond opened his eyes complained of great pain in his knee a feeling of heaviness in his head and severe pains in his loins they wished to carry him to the shore but when they touched him although under jacopos directions he declared with heavy groans that he could not bear to be moved it may be supposed that dants did not now think of his dinner but he insisted that his comrades who had not his reasons for fasting should have their meal as for himself he declared that he had only need of a little rest and that when they returned he should be easier the sailors did not require much urging they were hungry and the smell of the roasted kid was very savory and your tars are not very ceremonious an hour afterwards they returned all that edmond had been able to do was to drag himself about a dozen paces forward to lean against a moss-grown rock but instead of growing easier dants pains appeared to increase in violence the old patron who was obliged to sail in the morning in order to land his cargo on the frontiers of piedmont and france between nice and frjus urged dants to try and rise edmond made great exertions in order to comply but at each effort he fell back moaning and turning pale he has broken his ribs said the commander in a low voice no matter he is an excellent fellow and we must not leave him we will try and carry him on board the tartan dants declared however that he would rather die where he was than undergo the agony which the slightest movement cost him well said the patron let what may happen it shall never be said that we deserted a good comrade like you we will not go till evening this very much astonished the sailors although not one opposed it the patron was so strict that this was the first time they had ever seen him give up an enterprise or even delay in its execution dants would not allow that any such infraction of regular and proper rules should be made in his favor no no he said to the patron i was awkward and it is just that i pay the penalty of my clumsiness leave me a small supply of biscuit a gun powder and balls to kill the kids or defend myself at need and a pickaxe that i may build a shelter if you delay in coming back for me but youll die of hunger said the patron i would rather do
