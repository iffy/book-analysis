have tis like a duel i have already recorded sentence of death five or six times against the movers of political conspiracies and who can say how many daggers may be ready sharpened and only waiting a favorable opportunity to be buried in my heart gracious heavens m de villefort said rene becoming more and more terrified you surely are not in earnest indeed i am replied the young magistrate with a smile and in the interesting trial that young lady is anxious to witness the case would only be still more aggravated suppose for instance the prisoner as is more than probable to have served under napoleon well can you expect for an instant that one accustomed at the word of his commander to rush fearlessly on the very bayonets of his foe will scruple more to drive a stiletto into the heart of one he knows to be his personal enemy than to slaughter his fellow-creatures merely because bidden to do so by one he is bound to obey besides one requires the excitement of being hateful in the eyes of the accused in order to lash ones self into a state of sufficient vehemence and power i would not choose to see the man against whom i pleaded smile as though in mockery of my words no my pride is to see the accused pale agitated and as though beaten out of all composure by the fire of my eloquence rene uttered a smothered exclamation bravo cried one of the guests that is what i call talking to some purpose just the person we require at a time like the present said a second what a splendid business that last case of yours was my dear villefort remarked a third i mean the trial of the man for murdering his father upon my word you killed him ere the executioner had laid his hand upon him oh as for parricides and such dreadful people as that interposed rene it matters very little what is done to them but as regards poor unfortunate creatures whose only crime consists in having mixed themselves up in political intrigues why that is the very worst offence they could possibly commit for dont you see rene the king is the father of his people and he who shall plot or contrive aught against the life and safety of the parent of thirty-two millions of souls is a parricide upon a fearfully great scale i dont know anything about that replied rene but m de villefort you have promised me have you not always to show mercy to those i plead for make yourself quite easy on that point answered villefort with one of his sweetest smiles you and i will always consult upon our verdicts my love said the marquise attend to your doves your lap-dogs and embroidery but do not meddle with what you do not understand nowadays the military profession is in abeyance and the magisterial robe is the badge of honor there is a wise latin proverb that is very much in point cedant arma tog said villefort with a bow i cannot speak latin responded the marquise well said rene i cannot help regretting you had not chosen some other profession than your own a physician for instance do you know i always felt a shudder at the idea of even a destroying angel dear good rene whispered villefort as he gazed with unutterable tenderness on the lovely speaker let us hope my child cried the marquis that m de villefort may prove the moral and political physician of this province if so he will have achieved a noble work and one which will go far to efface the recollection of his fathers
