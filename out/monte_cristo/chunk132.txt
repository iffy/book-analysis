which his friend jacopo had left him he smiled the infernal invention would serve him for this purpose with the aid of his pickaxe dants after the manner of a labor-saving pioneer dug a mine between the upper rock and the one that supported it filled it with powder then made a match by rolling his handkerchief in saltpetre he lighted it and retired the explosion soon followed the upper rock was lifted from its base by the terrific force of the powder the lower one flew into pieces thousands of insects escaped from the aperture dants had previously formed and a huge snake like the guardian demon of the treasure rolled himself along in darkening coils and disappeared dants approached the upper rock which now without any support leaned towards the sea the intrepid treasure-seeker walked round it and selecting the spot from whence it appeared most susceptible to attack placed his lever in one of the crevices and strained every nerve to move the mass the rock already shaken by the explosion tottered on its base dants redoubled his efforts he seemed like one of the ancient titans who uprooted the mountains to hurl against the father of the gods the rock yielded rolled over bounded from point to point and finally disappeared in the ocean on the spot it had occupied was a circular space exposing an iron ring let into a square flag-stone dants uttered a cry of joy and surprise never had a first attempt been crowned with more perfect success he would fain have continued but his knees trembled and his heart beat so violently and his sight became so dim that he was forced to pause this feeling lasted but for a moment edmond inserted his lever in the ring and exerted all his strength the flag-stone yielded and disclosed steps that descended until they were lost in the obscurity of a subterraneous grotto anyone else would have rushed on with a cry of joy dants turned pale hesitated and reflected come said he to himself be a man i am accustomed to adversity i must not be cast down by the discovery that i have been deceived what then would be the use of all i have suffered the heart breaks when after having been elated by flattering hopes it sees all its illusions destroyed faria has dreamed this the cardinal spada buried no treasure here perhaps he never came here or if he did csar borgia the intrepid adventurer the stealthy and indefatigable plunderer has followed him discovered his traces pursued them as i have done raised the stone and descending before me has left me nothing he remained motionless and pensive his eyes fixed on the gloomy aperture that was open at his feet now that i expect nothing now that i no longer entertain the slightest hopes the end of this adventure becomes simply a matter of curiosity and he remained again motionless and thoughtful yes yes this is an adventure worthy a place in the varied career of that royal bandit this fabulous event formed but a link in a long chain of marvels yes borgia has been here a torch in one hand a sword in the other and within twenty paces at the foot of this rock perhaps two guards kept watch on land and sea while their master descended as i am about to descend dispelling the darkness before his awe-inspiring progress m but what was the fate of the guards who thus possessed his secret asked dants of himself the fate replied he smiling of those who buried alaric and were interred with the corpse yet had he come thought dants he would have found the treasure and borgia
