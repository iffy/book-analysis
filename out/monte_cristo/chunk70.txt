replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound contempt they went out the turnkey closed the door behind them he was wealthy once perhaps said the inspector or dreamed he was and awoke mad after all said the inspector if he had been rich he would not have been here so the matter ended for the abb faria he remained in his cell and this visit only increased the belief in his insanity caligula or nero those treasure-seekers those desirers of the impossible would have accorded to the poor wretch in exchange for his wealth the liberty he so earnestly prayed for but the kings of modern times restrained by the limits of mere probability have neither courage nor desire they fear the ear that hears their orders and the eye that scrutinizes their actions formerly they believed themselves sprung from jupiter and shielded by their birth but nowadays they are not inviolable it has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer the victims of their persecutions to reappear as the inquisition rarely allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and their flesh lacerated by torture so madness is always concealed in its cell from whence should it depart it is conveyed to some gloomy hospital where the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the mutilated being the jailer delivers to him the very madness of the abb faria gone mad in prison condemned him to perpetual captivity the inspector kept his word with dants he examined the register and found the following note concerning him edmond dants violent bonapartist took an active part in the return from elba the greatest watchfulness and care to be exercised this note was in a different hand from the rest which showed that it had been added since his confinement the inspector could not contend against this accusation he simply wrote nothing to be done this visit had infused new vigor into dants he had till then forgotten the date but now with a fragment of plaster he wrote the date th july and made a mark every day in order not to lose his reckoning again days and weeks passed away then months dants still waited he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight this fortnight expired he decided that the inspector would do nothing until his return to paris and that he would not reach there until his circuit was finished he therefore fixed three months three months passed away then six more finally ten months and a half had gone by and no favorable change had taken place and dants began to fancy the inspectors visit but a dream an illusion of the brain at the expiration of a year the governor was transferred he had obtained charge of the fortress at ham he took with him several of his subordinates and amongst them dants jailer a new governor arrived it would have been too tedious to acquire the names of the prisoners he learned their numbers instead this horrible place contained fifty cells their inhabitants were designated by the numbers of their cell and the unhappy young man was no longer called edmond dants he was now number chapter number and number dants passed through all the stages of torture natural to prisoners in suspense he was sustained at first by that pride of conscious innocence which is the sequence to hope then he began to doubt his own innocence which justified in some measure the governors belief in his mental alienation and then relaxing his sentiment of pride he addressed his supplications not to god but to man god is always the last resource unfortunates who ought to begin with god
