aside our most established opinions or at all events to cause us to remodel them according to the change of circumstances which may have placed affairs in a totally different light to that in which we at first viewed them i do not understand you baron said morcerf what i mean to say is this sir that during the last fortnight unforeseen circumstances have occurred excuse me said morcerf but is it a play we are acting a play yes for it is like one pray let us come more to the point and endeavor thoroughly to understand each other that is quite my desire you have seen m de monte cristo have you not i see him very often said danglars drawing himself up he is a particular friend of mine well in one of your late conversations with him you said that i appeared to be forgetful and irresolute concerning this marriage did you not i did say so well here i am proving at once that i am really neither the one nor the other by entreating you to keep your promise on that score danglars did not answer have you so soon changed your mind added morcerf or have you only provoked my request that you may have the pleasure of seeing me humbled danglars seeing that if he continued the conversation in the same tone in which he had begun it the whole thing might turn out to his own disadvantage turned to morcerf and said count you must doubtless be surprised at my reserve and i assure you it costs me much to act in such a manner towards you but believe me when i say that imperative necessity has imposed the painful task upon me these are all so many empty words my dear sir said morcerf they might satisfy a new acquaintance but the comte de morcerf does not rank in that list and when a man like him comes to another recalls to him his plighted word and this man fails to redeem the pledge he has at least a right to exact from him a good reason for so doing danglars was a coward but did not wish to appear so he was piqued at the tone which morcerf had just assumed i am not without a good reason for my conduct replied the banker what do you mean to say i mean to say that i have a good reason but that it is difficult to explain you must be aware at all events that it is impossible for me to understand motives before they are explained to me but one thing at least is clear which is that you decline allying yourself with my family no sir said danglars i merely suspend my decision that is all and do you really flatter yourself that i shall yield to all your caprices and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received into your good graces then count if you will not wait we must look upon these projects as if they had never been entertained the count bit his lips till the blood almost started to prevent the ebullition of anger which his proud and irritable temper scarcely allowed him to restrain understanding however that in the present state of things the laugh would decidedly be against him he turned from the door towards which he had been directing his steps and again confronted the banker a cloud settled on his brow evincing decided anxiety and uneasiness instead of the expression of offended pride which had lately reigned there my dear danglars said morcerf we have been acquainted for many years and consequently we ought to make some allowance for each others
