this morning that tired of letting his property lie dormant in italy which is a dead nation he wished to find a method either in france or england of multiplying his millions but remember that though i place great confidence in busoni i am not responsible for this never mind accept my thanks for the client you have sent me it is a fine name to inscribe on my ledgers and my cashier was quite proud of it when i explained to him who the cavalcanti were by the way this is merely a simple question when this sort of people marry their sons do they give them any fortune oh that depends upon circumstances i know an italian prince rich as a gold mine one of the noblest families in tuscany who when his sons married according to his wish gave them millions and when they married against his consent merely allowed them thirty crowns a month should andrea marry according to his fathers views he will perhaps give him one two or three millions for example supposing it were the daughter of a banker he might take an interest in the house of the father-in-law of his son then again if he disliked his choice the major takes the key double-locks his coffer and master andrea would be obliged to live like the sons of a parisian family by shuffling cards or rattling the dice ah that boy will find out some bavarian or peruvian princess he will want a crown an el dorado and potos no these grand lords on the other side of the alps frequently marry into plain families like jupiter they like to cross the race but do you wish to marry andrea my dear m danglars that you are asking so many questions ma foi said danglars it would not be a bad speculation i fancy and you know i am a speculator you are not thinking of mademoiselle danglars i hope you would not like poor andrea to have his throat cut by albert albert repeated danglars shrugging his shoulders ah well he would care very little about it i think but he is betrothed to your daughter i believe well m de morcerf and i have talked about this marriage but madame de morcerf and albert you do not mean to say that it would not be a good match indeed i imagine that mademoiselle danglars is as good as m de morcerf mademoiselle danglars fortune will be great no doubt especially if the telegraph should not make any more mistakes oh i do not mean her fortune only but tell me what why did you not invite m and madame de morcerf to your dinner i did so but he excused himself on account of madame de morcerf being obliged to go to dieppe for the benefit of sea air yes yes said danglars laughing it would do her a great deal of good why so because it is the air she always breathed in her youth monte cristo took no notice of this ill-natured remark but still if albert be not so rich as mademoiselle danglars said the count you must allow that he has a fine name so he has but i like mine as well certainly your name is popular and does honor to the title they have adorned it with but you are too intelligent not to know that according to a prejudice too firmly rooted to be exterminated a nobility which dates back five centuries is worth more than one that can only reckon twenty years and for this very reason said danglars with a smile which he tried to make sardonic i prefer m andrea cavalcanti to m albert
