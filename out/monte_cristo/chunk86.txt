of the wine brought to me every sunday and i assure you a better ink cannot be desired for very important notes for which closer attention is required i pricked one of my fingers and wrote with my own blood and when asked dants may i see all this whenever you please replied the abb oh then let it be directly exclaimed the young man follow me then said the abb as he re-entered the subterranean passage in which he soon disappeared followed by dants chapter the abbs chamber after having passed with tolerable ease through the subterranean passage which however did not admit of their holding themselves erect the two friends reached the further end of the corridor into which the abbs cell opened from that point the passage became much narrower and barely permitted one to creep through on hands and knees the floor of the abbs cell was paved and it had been by raising one of the stones in the most obscure corner that faria had been able to commence the laborious task of which dants had witnessed the completion as he entered the chamber of his friend dants cast around one eager and searching glance in quest of the expected marvels but nothing more than common met his view it is well said the abb we have some hours before us it is now just a quarter past twelve oclock instinctively dants turned round to observe by what watch or clock the abb had been able so accurately to specify the hour look at this ray of light which enters by my window said the abb and then observe the lines traced on the wall well by means of these lines which are in accordance with the double motion of the earth and the ellipse it describes round the sun i am enabled to ascertain the precise hour with more minuteness than if i possessed a watch for that might be broken or deranged in its movements while the sun and earth never vary in their appointed paths this last explanation was wholly lost upon dants who had always imagined from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in the mediterranean that it moved and not the earth a double movement of the globe he inhabited and of which he could feel nothing appeared to him perfectly impossible each word that fell from his companions lips seemed fraught with the mysteries of science as worthy of digging out as the gold and diamonds in the mines of guzerat and golconda which he could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in his earliest youth come said he to the abb i am anxious to see your treasures the abb smiled and proceeding to the disused fireplace raised by the help of his chisel a long stone which had doubtless been the hearth beneath which was a cavity of considerable depth serving as a safe depository of the articles mentioned to dants m what do you wish to see first asked the abb oh your great work on the monarchy of italy faria then drew forth from his hiding-place three or four rolls of linen laid one over the other like folds of papyrus these rolls consisted of slips of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long they were all carefully numbered and closely covered with writing so legible that dants could easily read it as well as make out the sense it being in italian a language he as a provenal perfectly understood there said he there is the work complete i wrote the word finis at the end of the sixty-eighth strip about a week ago i have torn up two of my shirts
