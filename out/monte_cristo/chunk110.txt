paled the ineffectual light of the lamp strange shadows passed over the countenance of the dead man and at times gave it the appearance of life while the struggle between day and night lasted dants still doubted but as soon as the daylight gained the pre-eminence he saw that he was alone with a corpse then an invincible and extreme terror seized upon him and he dared not again press the hand that hung out of bed he dared no longer to gaze on those fixed and vacant eyes which he tried many times to close but in vain they opened again as soon as shut he extinguished the lamp carefully concealed it and then went away closing as well as he could the entrance to the secret passage by the large stone as he descended it was time for the jailer was coming on this occasion he began his rounds at dants cell and on leaving him he went on to farias dungeon taking thither breakfast and some linen nothing betokened that the man knew anything of what had occurred he went on his way dants was then seized with an indescribable desire to know what was going on in the dungeon of his unfortunate friend he therefore returned by the subterraneous gallery and arrived in time to hear the exclamations of the turnkey who called out for help other turnkeys came and then was heard the regular tramp of soldiers last of all came the governor edmond heard the creaking of the bed as they moved the corpse heard the voice of the governor who asked them to throw water on the dead mans face and seeing that in spite of this application the prisoner did not recover they sent for the doctor the governor then went out and words of pity fell on dants listening ears mingled with brutal laughter well well said one the madman has gone to look after his treasure good journey to him with all his millions he will not have enough to pay for his shroud said another oh added a third voice the shrouds of the chteau dif are not dear m perhaps said one of the previous speakers as he was a churchman they may go to some expense in his behalf they may give him the honors of the sack edmond did not lose a word but comprehended very little of what was said the voices soon ceased and it seemed to him as if everyone had left the cell still he dared not to enter as they might have left some turnkey to watch the dead he remained therefore mute and motionless hardly venturing to breathe at the end of an hour he heard a faint noise which increased it was the governor who returned followed by the doctor and other attendants there was a moments silence it was evident that the doctor was examining the dead body the inquiries soon commenced the doctor analyzed the symptoms of the malady to which the prisoner had succumbed and declared that he was dead questions and answers followed in a nonchalant manner that made dants indignant for he felt that all the world should have for the poor abb a love and respect equal to his own i am very sorry for what you tell me said the governor replying to the assurance of the doctor that the old man is really dead for he was a quiet inoffensive prisoner happy in his folly and required no watching ah added the turnkey there was no occasion for watching him he would have stayed here fifty years ill answer for it without any attempt to escape still said the governor i believe it will be requisite
