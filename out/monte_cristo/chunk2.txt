as it would have been on board a man-of-war let go and clue up at this last command all the sails were lowered and the vessel moved almost imperceptibly onwards now if you will come on board m morrel said dants observing the owners impatience here is your supercargo m danglars coming out of his cabin who will furnish you with every particular as for me i must look after the anchoring and dress the ship in mourning the owner did not wait for a second invitation he seized a rope which dants flung to him and with an activity that would have done credit to a sailor climbed up the side of the ship while the young man going to his task left the conversation to danglars who now came towards the owner he was a man of twenty-five or twenty-six years of age of unprepossessing countenance obsequious to his superiors insolent to his subordinates and this in addition to his position as responsible agent on board which is always obnoxious to the sailors made him as much disliked by the crew as edmond dants was beloved by them well m morrel said danglars you have heard of the misfortune that has befallen us yes yes poor captain leclere he was a brave and an honest man and a first-rate seaman one who had seen long and honorable service as became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as that of morrel son replied danglars but replied the owner glancing after dants who was watching the anchoring of his vessel it seems to me that a sailor needs not be so old as you say danglars to understand his business for our friend edmond seems to understand it thoroughly and not to require instruction from anyone yes said danglars darting at edmond a look gleaming with hate yes he is young and youth is invariably self-confident scarcely was the captains breath out of his body when he assumed the command without consulting anyone and he caused us to lose a day and a half at the island of elba instead of making for marseilles direct m as to taking command of the vessel replied morrel that was his duty as captains mate as to losing a day and a half off the island of elba he was wrong unless the vessel needed repairs the vessel was in as good condition as i am and as i hope you are m morrel and this day and a half was lost from pure whim for the pleasure of going ashore and nothing else dants said the shipowner turning towards the young man come this way in a moment sir answered dants and im with you then calling to the crew he said let go the anchor was instantly dropped and the chain ran rattling through the port-hole dants continued at his post in spite of the presence of the pilot until this manuvre was completed and then he added half-mast the colors and square the yards you see said danglars he fancies himself captain already upon my word and so in fact he is said the owner except your signature and your partners m morrel and why should he not have this asked the owner he is young it is true but he seems to me a thorough seaman and of full experience a cloud passed over danglars brow your pardon m morrel said dants approaching the vessel now rides at anchor and i am at your service you hailed me i think danglars retreated a step or two i wished to inquire why you stopped at the island of elba i do not know sir it was to fulfil the last
