to the throne this battle of folly and flame continued for two hours the corso was light as day the features of the spectators on the third and fourth stories were visible every five minutes albert took out his watch at length it pointed to seven the two friends were in the via dei pontefici albert sprang out bearing his moccoletto in his hand two or three masks strove to knock his moccoletto out of his hand but albert a first-rate pugilist sent them rolling in the street one after the other and continued his course towards the church of san giacomo the steps were crowded with masks who strove to snatch each others torches franz followed albert with his eyes and saw him mount the first step instantly a mask wearing the well-known costume of a peasant woman snatched his moccoletto from him without his offering any resistance franz was too far off to hear what they said but without doubt nothing hostile passed for he saw albert disappear arm-in-arm with the peasant girl he watched them pass through the crowd for some time but at length he lost sight of them in the via macello suddenly the bell that gives the signal for the end of the carnival sounded and at the same instant all the moccoletti were extinguished as if by enchantment it seemed as though one immense blast of the wind had extinguished everyone franz found himself in utter darkness no sound was audible save that of the carriages that were carrying the maskers home nothing was visible save a few lights that burnt behind the windows the carnival was over m chapter the catacombs of saint sebastian in his whole life perhaps franz had never before experienced so sudden an impression so rapid a transition from gayety to sadness as in this moment it seemed as though rome under the magic breath of some demon of the night had suddenly changed into a vast tomb by a chance which added yet more to the intensity of the darkness the moon which was on the wane did not rise until eleven oclock and the streets which the young man traversed were plunged in the deepest obscurity the distance was short and at the end of ten minutes his carriage or rather the counts stopped before the htel de londres dinner was waiting but as albert had told him that he should not return so soon franz sat down without him signor pastrini who had been accustomed to see them dine together inquired into the cause of his absence but franz merely replied that albert had received on the previous evening an invitation which he had accepted the sudden extinction of the moccoletti the darkness which had replaced the light and the silence which had succeeded the turmoil had left in franzs mind a certain depression which was not free from uneasiness he therefore dined very silently in spite of the officious attention of his host who presented himself two or three times to inquire if he wanted anything franz resolved to wait for albert as late as possible he ordered the carriage therefore for eleven oclock desiring signor pastrini to inform him the moment that albert returned to the hotel at eleven oclock albert had not come back franz dressed himself and went out telling his host that he was going to pass the night at the duke of braccianos the house of the duke of bracciano is one of the most delightful in rome the duchess one of the last heiresses of the colonnas does its honors with the most consummate grace and thus their ftes have a european celebrity franz and albert had brought to rome letters of introduction
