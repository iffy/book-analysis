of about thirty or two-and-thirty dressed in a bright blue frock coat nankeen trousers and a white waistcoat having the appearance and accent of an englishman presented himself before the mayor of marseilles sir said he i am chief clerk of the house of thomson french of rome we are and have been these ten years connected with the house of morrel son of marseilles we have a hundred thousand francs or thereabouts loaned on their securities and we are a little uneasy at reports that have reached us that the firm is on the brink of ruin i have come therefore express from rome to ask you for information sir replied the mayor i know very well that during the last four or five years misfortune has seemed to pursue m morrel he has lost four or five vessels and suffered by three or four bankruptcies but it is not for me although i am a creditor myself to the amount of ten thousand francs to give any information as to the state of his finances ask of me as mayor what is my opinion of m morrel and i shall say that he is a man honorable to the last degree and who has up to this time fulfilled every engagement with scrupulous punctuality this is all i can say sir if you wish to learn more address yourself to m de boville the inspector of prisons no rue de nouailles he has i believe two hundred thousand francs in morrels hands and if there be any grounds for apprehension as this is a greater amount than mine you will most probably find him better informed than myself the englishman seemed to appreciate this extreme delicacy made his bow and went away proceeding with a characteristic british stride towards the street mentioned m de boville was in his private room and the englishman on perceiving him made a gesture of surprise which seemed to indicate that it was not the first time he had been in his presence as to m de boville he was in such a state of despair that it was evident all the faculties of his mind absorbed in the thought which occupied him at the moment did not allow either his memory or his imagination to stray to the past the englishman with the coolness of his nation addressed him in terms nearly similar to those with which he had accosted the mayor of marseilles oh sir exclaimed m de boville your fears are unfortunately but too well founded and you see before you a man in despair i had two hundred thousand francs placed in the hands of morrel son these two hundred thousand francs were the dowry of my daughter who was to be married in a fortnight and these two hundred thousand francs were payable half on the th of this month and the other half on the th of next month i had informed m morrel of my desire to have these payments punctually and he has been here within the last half-hour to tell me that if his ship the pharaon did not come into port on the th he would be wholly unable to make this payment but said the englishman this looks very much like a suspension of payment it looks more like bankruptcy exclaimed m de boville despairingly the englishman appeared to reflect a moment and then said from which it would appear sir that this credit inspires you with considerable apprehension to tell you the truth i consider it lost well then i will buy it of you you yes i but at a tremendous discount of course no for two hundred thousand francs our house added the englishman
