fright last night replied dants smiling that i have almost lost my memory i ask you what year is it the year returned jacopo it was fourteen years day for day since dants arrest he was nineteen when he entered the chteau dif he was thirty-three when he escaped a sorrowful smile passed over his face he asked himself what had become of mercds who must believe him dead then his eyes lighted up with hatred as he thought of the three men who had caused him so long and wretched a captivity he renewed against danglars fernand and villefort the oath of implacable vengeance he had made in his dungeon this oath was no longer a vain menace for the fastest sailor in the mediterranean would have been unable to overtake the little tartan that with every stitch of canvas set was flying before the wind to leghorn chapter the smugglers dants had not been a day on board before he had a very clear idea of the men with whom his lot had been cast without having been in the school of the abb faria the worthy master of la jeune amlie the name of the genoese tartan knew a smattering of all the tongues spoken on the shores of that large lake called the mediterranean from the arabic to the provenal and this while it spared him interpreters persons always troublesome and frequently indiscreet gave him great facilities of communication either with the vessels he met at sea with the small boats sailing along the coast or with the people without name country or occupation who are always seen on the quays of seaports and who live by hidden and mysterious means which we must suppose to be a direct gift of providence as they have no visible means of support it is fair to assume that dants was on board a smuggler at first the captain had received dants on board with a certain degree of distrust he was very well known to the customs officers of the coast and as there was between these worthies and himself a perpetual battle of wits he had at first thought that dants might be an emissary of these industrious guardians of rights and duties who perhaps employed this ingenious means of learning some of the secrets of his trade but the skilful manner in which dants had handled the lugger had entirely reassured him and then when he saw the light plume of smoke floating above the bastion of the chteau dif and heard the distant report he was instantly struck with the idea that he had on board his vessel one whose coming and going like that of kings was accompanied with salutes of artillery this made him less uneasy it must be owned than if the new-comer had proved to be a customs officer but this supposition also disappeared like the first when he beheld the perfect tranquillity of his recruit edmond thus had the advantage of knowing what the owner was without the owner knowing who he was and however the old sailor and his crew tried to pump him they extracted nothing more from him he gave accurate descriptions of naples and malta which he knew as well as marseilles and held stoutly to his first story thus the genoese subtle as he was was duped by edmond in whose favor his mild demeanor his nautical skill and his admirable dissimulation pleaded moreover it is possible that the genoese was one of those shrewd persons who know nothing but what they should know and believe nothing but what they should believe in this state of mutual understanding they reached leghorn here edmond was to undergo another trial he was
