misfortune incomprehensible is the word interrupted the procureur shrugging his shoulders it is an old mans caprice and is there no means of making him revoke his decision yes said madame de villefort and it is still entirely in the power of my husband to cause the will which is now in prejudice of valentine to be altered in her favor the count who perceived that m and madame de villefort were beginning to speak in parables appeared to pay no attention to the conversation and feigned to be busily engaged in watching edward who was mischievously pouring some ink into the birds water-glass my dear said villefort in answer to his wife you know i have never been accustomed to play the patriarch in my family nor have i ever considered that the fate of a universe was to be decided by my nod nevertheless it is necessary that my will should be respected in my family and that the folly of an old man and the caprice of a child should not be allowed to overturn a project which i have entertained for so many years the baron dpinay was my friend as you know and an alliance with his son is the most suitable thing that could possibly be arranged do you think said madame de villefort that valentine is in league with him she has always been opposed to this marriage and i should not be at all surprised if what we have just seen and heard is nothing but the execution of a plan concerted between them madame said villefort believe me a fortune of francs is not so easily renounced she could nevertheless make up her mind to renounce the world sir since it is only about a year ago that she herself proposed entering a convent never mind replied villefort i say that this marriage shall be consummated notwithstanding your fathers wishes to the contrary said madame de villefort selecting a new point of attack that is a serious thing monte cristo who pretended not to be listening heard however every word that was said m madame replied villefort i can truly say that i have always entertained a high respect for my father because to the natural feeling of relationship was added the consciousness of his moral superiority the name of father is sacred in two senses he should be reverenced as the author of our being and as a master whom we ought to obey but under the present circumstances i am justified in doubting the wisdom of an old man who because he hated the father vents his anger on the son it would be ridiculous in me to regulate my conduct by such caprices i shall still continue to preserve the same respect toward m noirtier i will suffer without complaint the pecuniary deprivation to which he has subjected me but i shall remain firm in my determination and the world shall see which party has reason on his side consequently i shall marry my daughter to the baron franz dpinay because i consider it would be a proper and eligible match for her to make and in short because i choose to bestow my daughters hand on whomever i please what said the count the approbation of whose eye villefort had frequently solicited during this speech what do you say that m noirtier disinherits mademoiselle de villefort because she is going to marry m le baron franz dpinay yes sir that is the reason said villefort shrugging his shoulders the apparent reason at least said madame de villefort the real reason madame i can assure you i know my father but i want to know in what way m dpinay can have displeased
