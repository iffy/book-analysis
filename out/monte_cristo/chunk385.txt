then the postscript is as favorably received by you as the rest of the letter certainly the abb busoni and myself have a small account open between us i do not remember if it is exactly francs which i am still owing him but i dare say we shall not dispute the difference you attached great importance then to this postscript my dear monsieur cavalcanti i must explain to you said the major that fully confiding in the signature of the abb busoni i had not provided myself with any other funds so that if this resource had failed me i should have found myself very unpleasantly situated in paris is it possible that a man of your standing should be embarrassed anywhere said monte cristo why really i know no one said the major but then you yourself are known to others yes i am known so that proceed my dear monsieur cavalcanti so that you will remit to me these francs certainly at your first request the majors eyes dilated with pleasing astonishment but sit down said monte cristo really i do not know what i have been thinking of i have positively kept you standing for the last quarter of an hour dont mention it the major drew an armchair towards him and proceeded to seat himself now said the count what will you take a glass of sherry port or alicante alicante if you please it is my favorite wine i have some that is very good you will take a biscuit with it will you not yes i will take a biscuit as you are so obliging monte cristo rang baptistin appeared the count advanced to meet him well said he in a low voice the young man is here said the valet de chambre in the same tone into what room did you take him into the blue drawing-room according to your excellencys orders thats right now bring the alicante and some biscuits baptistin left the room really said the major i am quite ashamed of the trouble i am giving you pray dont mention such a thing said the count baptistin re-entered with glasses wine and biscuits the count filled one glass but in the other he only poured a few drops of the ruby-colored liquid the bottle was covered with spiders webs and all the other signs which indicate the age of wine more truly than do wrinkles on a mans face the major made a wise choice he took the full glass and a biscuit the count told baptistin to leave the plate within reach of his guest who began by sipping the alicante with an expression of great satisfaction and then delicately steeped his biscuit in the wine m so sir you lived at lucca did you you were rich noble held in great esteem had all that could render a man happy all said the major hastily swallowing his biscuit positively all and yet there was one thing wanting in order to complete your happiness only one thing said the italian and that one thing your lost child ah said the major taking a second biscuit that consummation of my happiness was indeed wanting the worthy major raised his eyes to heaven and sighed let me hear then said the count who this deeply regretted son was for i always understood you were a bachelor that was the general opinion sir said the major and i yes replied the count and you confirmed the report a youthful indiscretion i suppose which you were anxious to conceal from the world at large the major recovered himself and resumed his usual calm manner at the same time casting his eyes down either to give himself time
