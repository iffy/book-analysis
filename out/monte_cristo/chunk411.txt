showed that there was something wanting which he knew where to find the old servant left the room and presently returned bringing with him a small casket do you permit us to open this casket asked the notary noirtier gave his assent they opened it and found francs in bank scrip the first notary handed over each note as he examined it to his colleague the total amount was found to be as m noirtier had stated it is all as he has said it is very evident that the mind still retains its full force and vigor then turning towards the paralytic he said you possess then francs of capital which according to the manner in which you have invested it ought to bring in an income of about livres yes to whom do you desire to leave this fortune oh said madame de villefort there is not much doubt on that subject m noirtier tenderly loves his granddaughter mademoiselle de villefort it is she who has nursed and tended him for six years and has by her devoted attention fully secured the affection i had almost said the gratitude of her grandfather and it is but just that she should reap the fruit of her devotion the eye of noirtier clearly showed by its expression that he was not deceived by the false assent given by madame de villeforts words and manner to the motives which she supposed him to entertain is it then to mademoiselle valentine de villefort that you leave these francs demanded the notary thinking he had only to insert this clause but waiting first for the assent of noirtier which it was necessary should be given before all the witnesses of this singular scene valentine when her name was made the subject of discussion had stepped back to escape unpleasant observation her eyes were cast down and she was crying the old man looked at her for an instant with an expression of the deepest tenderness then turning towards the notary he significantly winked his eye in token of dissent what said the notary do you not intend making mademoiselle valentine de villefort your residuary legatee no you are not making any mistake are you said the notary you really mean to declare that such is not your intention no repeated noirtier no valentine raised her head struck dumb with astonishment it was not so much the conviction that she was disinherited that caused her grief but her total inability to account for the feelings which had provoked her grandfather to such an act but noirtier looked at her with so much affectionate tenderness that she exclaimed oh grandpapa i see now that it is only your fortune of which you deprive me you still leave me the love which i have always enjoyed ah yes most assuredly said the eyes of the paralytic for he closed them with an expression which valentine could not mistake thank you thank you murmured she the old mans declaration that valentine was not the destined inheritor of his fortune had excited the hopes of madame de villefort she gradually approached the invalid and said then doubtless dear m noirtier you intend leaving your fortune to your grandson edward de villefort the winking of the eyes which answered this speech was most decided and terrible and expressed a feeling almost amounting to hatred no said the notary then perhaps it is to your son m de villefort no the two notaries looked at each other in mute astonishment and inquiry as to what were the real intentions of the testator villefort and his wife both grew red one from shame the other from anger what have we all done then dear grandpapa said
