being decidedly mortal and if it were not would be sure to become so thanks to the remedies applied by foolish doctors who are generally bad chemists and which will act in favor of or against the malady as you please and then there is a human being killed according to all the rules of art and skill and of whom justice learns nothing as was said by a terrible chemist of my acquaintance the worthy abb adelmonte of taormina in sicily who has studied these national phenomena very profoundly it is quite frightful but deeply interesting said the young lady motionless with attention i thought i must confess that these tales were inventions of the middle ages yes no doubt but improved upon by ours what is the use of time rewards of merit medals crosses monthyon prizes if they do not lead society towards more complete perfection yet man will never be perfect until he learns to create and destroy he does know how to destroy and that is half the battle so added madame de villefort constantly returning to her object the poisons of the borgias the medicis the renes the ruggieris and later probably that of baron de trenck whose story has been so misused by modern drama and romance were objects of art madame and nothing more replied the count do you suppose that the real savant addresses himself stupidly to the mere individual by no means science loves eccentricities leaps and bounds trials of strength fancies if i may be allowed so to term them thus for instance the excellent abb adelmonte of whom i spoke just now made in this way some marvellous experiments really yes i will mention one to you he had a remarkably fine garden full of vegetables flowers and fruit from amongst these vegetables he selected the most simple a cabbage for instance for three days he watered this cabbage with a distillation of arsenic on the third the cabbage began to droop and turn yellow at that moment he cut it in the eyes of everybody it seemed fit for table and preserved its wholesome appearance it was only poisoned to the abb adelmonte he then took the cabbage to the room where he had rabbits for the abb adelmonte had a collection of rabbits cats and guinea-pigs fully as fine as his collection of vegetables flowers and fruit well the abb adelmonte took a rabbit and made it eat a leaf of the cabbage the rabbit died what magistrate would find or even venture to insinuate anything against this what procureur has ever ventured to draw up an accusation against m magendie or m flourens in consequence of the rabbits cats and guinea-pigs they have killed not one so then the rabbit dies and justice takes no notice this rabbit dead the abb adelmonte has its entrails taken out by his cook and thrown on the dunghill on this dunghill is a hen who pecking these intestines is in her turn taken ill and dies next day at the moment when she is struggling in the convulsions of death a vulture is flying by there are a good many vultures in adelmontes country this bird darts on the dead fowl and carries it away to a rock where it dines off its prey three days afterwards this poor vulture which has been very much indisposed since that dinner suddenly feels very giddy while flying aloft in the clouds and falls heavily into a fish-pond the pike eels and carp eat greedily always as everybody knows well they feast on the vulture now suppose that next day one of these eels or pike or carp poisoned at the fourth remove is served up
