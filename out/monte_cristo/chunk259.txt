possessed no acquaintance there and of necessity was compelled to abandon the idea so distinguished an individual as yourself cried albert could scarcely have required an introduction you are most kind but as regards myself i can find no merit i possess save that as a millionaire i might have become a partner in the speculations of m aguado and m rothschild but as my motive in travelling to your capital would not have been for the pleasure of dabbling in stocks i stayed away till some favorable chance should present itself of carrying my wish into execution your offer however smooths all difficulties and i have only to ask you my dear m de morcerf these words were accompanied by a most peculiar smile whether you undertake upon my arrival in france to open to me the doors of that fashionable world of which i know no more than a huron or a native of cochin-china oh that i do and with infinite pleasure answered albert and so much the more readily as a letter received this morning from my father summons me to paris in consequence of a treaty of marriage my dear franz do not smile i beg of you with a family of high standing and connected with the very cream of parisian society connected by marriage you mean said franz laughingly well never mind how it is answered albert it comes to the same thing in the end perhaps by the time you return to paris i shall be quite a sober staid father of a family a most edifying representative i shall make of all the domestic virtues dont you think so but as regards your wish to visit our fine city my dear count i can only say that you may command me and mine to any extent you please then it is settled said the count and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that i have long meditated franz did not doubt that these plans were the same concerning which the count had dropped a few words in the grotto of monte cristo and while the count was speaking the young man watched him closely hoping to read something of his purpose in his face but his countenance was inscrutable especially when as in the present case it was veiled in a sphinx-like smile but tell me now count exclaimed albert delighted at the idea of having to chaperon so distinguished a person as monte cristo tell me truly whether you are in earnest or if this project of visiting paris is merely one of the chimerical and uncertain air castles of which we make so many in the course of our lives but which like a house built on the sand is liable to be blown over by the first puff of wind i pledge you my honor returned the count that i mean to do as i have said both inclination and positive necessity compel me to visit paris when do you propose going thither have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself certainly i have in a fortnight or three weeks time that is to say as fast as i can get there nay said the count i will give you three months ere i join you you see i make an ample allowance for all delays and difficulties and in three months time said albert you will be at my house shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour inquired the count only let me warn you that i am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements day for day hour
