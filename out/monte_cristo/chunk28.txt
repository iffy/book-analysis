i thought the whole thing was a joke nothing more it seems however that i have unconsciously stumbled upon the truth still argued caderousse i would give a great deal if nothing of the kind had happened or at least that i had had no hand in it you will see danglars that it will turn out an unlucky job for both of us nonsense if any harm come of it it should fall on the guilty person and that you know is fernand how can we be implicated in any way all we have got to do is to keep our own counsel and remain perfectly quiet not breathing a word to any living soul and you will see that the storm will pass away without in the least affecting us amen responded caderousse waving his hand in token of adieu to danglars and bending his steps towards the alles de meilhan moving his head to and fro and muttering as he went after the manner of one whose mind was overcharged with one absorbing idea so far then said danglars mentally all has gone as i would have it i am temporarily commander of the pharaon with the certainty of being permanently so if that fool of a caderousse can be persuaded to hold his tongue my only fear is the chance of dants being released but there he is in the hands of justice and added he with a smile she will take her own so saying he leaped into a boat desiring to be rowed on board the pharaon where m morrel had agreed to meet him chapter the deputy procureur du roi in one of the aristocratic mansions built by puget in the rue du grand cours opposite the medusa fountain a second marriage feast was being celebrated almost at the same hour with the nuptial repast given by dants in this case however although the occasion of the entertainment was similar the company was strikingly dissimilar instead of a rude mixture of sailors soldiers and those belonging to the humblest grade of life the present assembly was composed of the very flower of marseilles society magistrates who had resigned their office during the usurpers reign officers who had deserted from the imperial army and joined forces with cond and younger members of families brought up to hate and execrate the man whom five years of exile would convert into a martyr and fifteen of restoration elevate to the rank of a god the guests were still at table and the heated and energetic conversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive passions that then agitated each dweller of the south where unhappily for five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness to the violence of party feeling the emperor now king of the petty island of elba after having held sovereign sway over one-half of the world counting as his subjects a small population of five or six thousand souls after having been accustomed to hear the vive napolons of a hundred and twenty millions of human beings uttered in ten different languages was looked upon here as a ruined man separated forever from any fresh connection with france or claim to her throne the magistrates freely discussed their political views the military part of the company talked unreservedly of moscow and leipsic while the women commented on the divorce of josephine it was not over the downfall of the man but over the defeat of the napoleonic idea that they rejoiced and in this they foresaw for themselves the bright and cheering prospect of a revivified political existence an old man decorated with the cross of saint louis now rose and proposed the health of king louis
