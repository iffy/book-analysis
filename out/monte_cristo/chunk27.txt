carefully to conceal from all else tis well danglars tis well replied m morrel you are a worthy fellow and i had already thought of your interests in the event of poor edmond having become captain of the pharaon is it possible you were so kind yes indeed i had previously inquired of dants what was his opinion of you and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your post for somehow i have perceived a sort of coolness between you and what was his reply that he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair which he merely referred to without entering into particulars but that whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ships owners would have his preference also the hypocrite murmured danglars poor dants said caderousse no one can deny his being a noble-hearted young fellow but meanwhile continued m morrel here is the pharaon without a captain oh replied danglars since we cannot leave this port for the next three months let us hope that ere the expiration of that period dants will be set at liberty no doubt but in the meantime i am entirely at your service m morrel answered danglars you know that i am as capable of managing a ship as the most experienced captain in the service and it will be so far advantageous to you to accept my services that upon edmonds release from prison no further change will be requisite on board the pharaon than for dants and myself each to resume our respective posts thanks danglars that will smooth over all difficulties i fully authorize you at once to assume the command of the pharaon and look carefully to the unloading of her freight private misfortunes must never be allowed to interfere with business be easy on that score m morrel but do you think we shall be permitted to see our poor edmond i will let you know that directly i have seen m de villefort whom i shall endeavor to interest in edmonds favor i am aware he is a furious royalist but in spite of that and of his being kings attorney he is a man like ourselves and i fancy not a bad sort of one perhaps not replied danglars but i hear that he is ambitious and thats rather against him well well returned m morrel we shall see but now hasten on board i will join you there ere long so saying the worthy shipowner quitted the two allies and proceeded in the direction of the palais de justice m you see said danglars addressing caderousse the turn things have taken do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence not the slightest but yet it seems to me a shocking thing that a mere joke should lead to such consequences but who perpetrated that joke let me ask neither you nor myself but fernand you knew very well that i threw the paper into a corner of the room indeed i fancied i had destroyed it oh no replied caderousse that i can answer for you did not i only wish i could see it now as plainly as i saw it lying all crushed and crumpled in a corner of the arbor well then if you did depend upon it fernand picked it up and either copied it or caused it to be copied perhaps even he did not take the trouble of recopying it and now i think of it by heavens he may have sent the letter itself fortunately for me the handwriting was disguised then you were aware of dants being engaged in a conspiracy not i as i before said
