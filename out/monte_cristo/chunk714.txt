then removed and behind the bed the new stones indicated where the breach made by the abb faria had been monte cristo felt his limbs tremble he seated himself upon a log of wood are there any stories connected with this prison besides the one relating to the poisoning of mirabeau asked the count are there any traditions respecting these dismal abodes in which it is difficult to believe men can ever have imprisoned their fellow-creatures yes sir indeed the jailer antoine told me one connected with this very dungeon monte cristo shuddered antoine had been his jailer he had almost forgotten his name and face but at the mention of the name he recalled his person as he used to see it the face encircled by a beard wearing the brown jacket the bunch of keys the jingling of which he still seemed to hear the count turned around and fancied he saw him in the corridor rendered still darker by the torch carried by the concierge would you like to hear the story sir yes relate it said monte cristo pressing his hand to his heart to still its violent beatings he felt afraid of hearing his own history this dungeon said the concierge was it appears some time ago occupied by a very dangerous prisoner the more so since he was full of industry another person was confined in the chteau at the same time but he was not wicked he was only a poor mad priest ah indeed mad repeated monte cristo and what was his mania he offered millions to anyone who would set him at liberty monte cristo raised his eyes but he could not see the heavens there was a stone veil between him and the firmament he thought that there had been no less thick a veil before the eyes of those to whom faria offered the treasures could the prisoners see each other he asked oh no sir it was expressly forbidden but they eluded the vigilance of the guards and made a passage from one dungeon to the other and which of them made this passage oh it must have been the young man certainly for he was strong and industrious while the abb was aged and weak besides his mind was too vacillating to allow him to carry out an idea blind fools murmured the count however be that as it may the young man made a tunnel how or by what means no one knows but he made it and there is the evidence yet remaining of his work do you see it and the man held the torch to the wall m ah yes i see said the count in a voice hoarse from emotion the result was that the two men communicated with one another how long they did so nobody knows one day the old man fell ill and died now guess what the young one did tell me he carried off the corpse which he placed in his own bed with its face to the wall then he entered the empty dungeon closed the entrance and slipped into the sack which had contained the dead body did you ever hear of such an idea monte cristo closed his eyes and seemed again to experience all the sensations he had felt when the coarse canvas yet moist with the cold dews of death had touched his face the jailer continued now this was his project he fancied that they buried the dead at the chteau dif and imagining they would not expend much labor on the grave of a prisoner he calculated on raising the earth with his shoulders but unfortunately their arrangements at the chteau frustrated his projects
