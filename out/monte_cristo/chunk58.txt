and then extended his hand to villefort who had followed all his motions with surprise which he could not conceal well now my dear grard said he to the young man with a very significant look do you know you seem as if you were not very glad to see me my dear father said villefort i am on the contrary delighted but i so little expected your visit that it has somewhat overcome me but my dear fellow replied m noirtier seating himself i might say the same thing to you when you announce to me your wedding for the th of february and on the rd of march you turn up here in paris and if i have come my dear father said grard drawing closer to m noirtier do not complain for it is for you that i came and my journey will be your salvation ah indeed said m noirtier stretching himself out at his ease in the chair really pray tell me all about it for it must be interesting father you have heard speak of a certain bonapartist club in the rue saint-jacques no yes i am vice-president father your coolness makes me shudder why my dear boy when a man has been proscribed by the mountaineers has escaped from paris in a hay-cart been hunted over the plains of bordeaux by robespierres bloodhounds he becomes accustomed to most things but go on what about the club in the rue saint-jacques why they induced general quesnel to go there and general quesnel who quitted his own house at nine oclock in the evening was found the next day in the seine m and who told you this fine story the king himself well then in return for your story continued noirtier i will tell you another my dear father i think i already know what you are about to tell me ah you have heard of the landing of the emperor not so loud father i entreat of you for your own sake as well as mine yes i heard this news and knew it even before you could for three days ago i posted from marseilles to paris with all possible speed half-desperate at the enforced delay three days ago you are crazy why three days ago the emperor had not landed no matter i was aware of his intention how did you know about it by a letter addressed to you from the island of elba to me to you and which i discovered in the pocket-book of the messenger had that letter fallen into the hands of another you my dear father would probably ere this have been shot villeforts father laughed come come said he will the restoration adopt imperial methods so promptly shot my dear boy what an idea where is the letter you speak of i know you too well to suppose you would allow such a thing to pass you i burnt it for fear that even a fragment should remain for that letter must have led to your condemnation and the destruction of your future prospects replied noirtier yes i can easily comprehend that but i have nothing to fear while i have you to protect me i do better than that sir i save you you do why really the thing becomes more and more dramatic explain yourself i must refer again to the club in the rue saint-jacques it appears that this club is rather a bore to the police why didnt they search more vigilantly they would have found they have not found but they are on the track yes that the usual phrase i am quite familiar with it when the police is at fault it declares
