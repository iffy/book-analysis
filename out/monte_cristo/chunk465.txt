saturday arrived upon which the ball was to take place at m de morcerfs it was ten oclock at night the branches of the great trees in the garden of the counts house stood out boldly against the azure canopy of heaven which was studded with golden stars but where the last fleeting clouds of a vanishing storm yet lingered from the apartments on the ground floor might be heard the sound of music with the whirl of the waltz and galop while brilliant streams of light shone through the openings of the venetian blinds at this moment the garden was only occupied by about ten servants who had just received orders from their mistress to prepare the supper the serenity of the weather continuing to increase until now it had been undecided whether the supper should take place in the dining-room or under a long tent erected on the lawn but the beautiful blue sky studded with stars had settled the question in favor of the lawn the gardens were illuminated with colored lanterns according to the italian custom and as is usual in countries where the luxuries of the table the rarest of all luxuries in their complete form are well understood the supper-table was loaded with wax-lights and flowers m at the time the countess of morcerf returned to the rooms after giving her orders many guests were arriving more attracted by the charming hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the count for owing to the good taste of mercds one was sure of finding some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing or even copying in case of need madame danglars in whom the events we have related had caused deep anxiety had hesitated about going to madame de morcerfs when during the morning her carriage happened to meet that of villefort the latter made a sign and when the carriages had drawn close together said you are going to madame de morcerfs are you not no replied madame danglars i am too ill you are wrong replied villefort significantly it is important that you should be seen there do you think so asked the baroness i do in that case i will go and the two carriages passed on towards their different destinations madame danglars therefore came not only beautiful in person but radiant with splendor she entered by one door at the time when mercds appeared at the door the countess took albert to meet madame danglars he approached paid her some well merited compliments on her toilet and offered his arm to conduct her to a seat albert looked around him you are looking for my daughter said the baroness smiling i confess it replied albert could you have been so cruel as not to bring her calm yourself she has met mademoiselle de villefort and has taken her arm see they are following us both in white dresses one with a bouquet of camellias the other with one of myosotis but tell me well what do you wish to know will not the count of monte cristo be here tonight seventeen replied albert what do you mean i only mean that the count seems the rage replied the viscount smiling and that you are the seventeenth person that has asked me the same question the count is in fashion i congratulate him upon it and have you replied to everyone as you have to me ah to be sure i have not answered you be satisfied we shall have this lion we are among the privileged ones were you at the opera yesterday no he was there ah indeed and did the eccentric person commit any new originality can he be seen without
