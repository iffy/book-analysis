what point shall i begin my story your excellency asked bertuccio where you please returned monte cristo since i know nothing at all of it i thought the abb busoni had told your excellency some particulars doubtless but that is seven or eight years ago and i have forgotten them then i can speak without fear of tiring your excellency go on m bertuccio you will supply the want of the evening papers the story begins in ah said monte cristo is not yesterday no monsieur and yet i recollect all things as clearly as if they had happened but then i had a brother an elder brother who was in the service of the emperor he had become lieutenant in a regiment composed entirely of corsicans this brother was my only friend we became orphans i at five he at eighteen he brought me up as if i had been his son and in he married when the emperor returned from the island of elba my brother instantly joined the army was slightly wounded at waterloo and retired with the army beyond the loire but that is the history of the hundred days m bertuccio said the count unless i am mistaken it has been already written excuse me excellency but these details are necessary and you promised to be patient go on i will keep my word one day we received a letter i should tell you that we lived in the little village of rogliano at the extremity of cap corse this letter was from my brother he told us that the army was disbanded and that he should return by chteauroux clermont-ferrand le puy and nmes and if i had any money he prayed me to leave it for him at nmes with an innkeeper with whom i had dealings in the smuggling line said monte cristo eh your excellency everyone must live certainly go on i loved my brother tenderly as i told your excellency and i resolved not to send the money but to take it to him myself i possessed a thousand francs i left five hundred with assunta my sister-in-law and with the other five hundred i set off for nmes it was easy to do so and as i had my boat and a lading to take in at sea everything favored my project but after we had taken in our cargo the wind became contrary so that we were four or five days without being able to enter the rhne at last however we succeeded and worked up to arles i left the boat between bellegarde and beaucaire and took the road to nmes we are getting to the story now yes your excellency excuse me but as you will see i only tell you what is absolutely necessary just at this time the famous massacres took place in the south of france three brigands called trestaillon truphemy and graffan publicly assassinated everybody whom they suspected of bonapartism you have doubtless heard of these massacres your excellency vaguely i was far from france at that period go on as i entered nmes i literally waded in blood at every step you encountered dead bodies and bands of murderers who killed plundered and burned at the sight of this slaughter and devastation i became terrified not for myself for i a simple corsican fisherman had nothing to fear on the contrary that time was most favorable for us smugglers but for my brother a soldier of the empire returning from the army of the loire with his uniform and his epaulets there was everything to apprehend i hastened to the innkeeper my misgivings had been but too true my brother had arrived the previous evening at
