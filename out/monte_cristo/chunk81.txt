dants as dextrously as he had ascended he nimbly leaped from the table to the ground what was it that you thought asked the young man anxiously in his turn descending from the table the elder prisoner pondered the matter yes said he at length it is so this side of your chamber looks out upon a kind of open gallery where patrols are continually passing and sentries keep watch day and night are you quite sure of that certain i saw the soldiers shape and the top of his musket that made me draw in my head so quickly for i was fearful he might also see me well inquired dants you perceive then the utter impossibility of escaping through your dungeon then pursued the young man eagerly then answered the elder prisoner the will of god be done and as the old man slowly pronounced those words an air of profound resignation spread itself over his careworn countenance dants gazed on the man who could thus philosophically resign hopes so long and ardently nourished with an astonishment mingled with admiration tell me i entreat of you who and what you are said he at length never have i met with so remarkable a person as yourself willingly answered the stranger if indeed you feel any curiosity respecting one now alas powerless to aid you in any way say not so you can console and support me by the strength of your own powerful mind pray let me know who you really are the stranger smiled a melancholy smile then listen said he i am the abb faria and have been imprisoned as you know in this chteau dif since the year previously to which i had been confined for three years in the fortress of fenestrelle in the year i was transferred to piedmont in france it was at this period i learned that the destiny which seemed subservient to every wish formed by napoleon had bestowed on him a son named king of rome even in his cradle i was very far then from expecting the change you have just informed me of namely that four years afterwards this colossus of power would be overthrown then who reigns in france at this moment napoleon ii no louis xviii the brother of louis xvi how inscrutable are the ways of providence for what great and mysterious purpose has it pleased heaven to abase the man once so elevated and raise up him who was so abased dants whole attention was riveted on a man who could thus forget his own misfortunes while occupying himself with the destinies of others yes yes continued he twill be the same as it was in england after charles i cromwell after cromwell charles ii and then james ii and then some son-in-law or relation some prince of orange a stadtholder who becomes a king then new concessions to the people then a constitution then liberty ah my friend said the abb turning towards dants and surveying him with the kindling gaze of a prophet you are young you will see all this come to pass probably if ever i get out of prison true replied faria we are prisoners but i forget this sometimes and there are even moments when my mental vision transports me beyond these walls and i fancy myself at liberty but wherefore are you here because in i dreamed of the very plan napoleon tried to realize in because like machiavelli i desired to alter the political face of italy and instead of allowing it to be split up into a quantity of petty principalities each held by some weak or tyrannical ruler i sought to form one large compact and powerful empire
