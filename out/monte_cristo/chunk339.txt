is as invisible as the parent you have seen nothing that resembles him because he works by secret springs and moves by hidden ways all i can do for you is to make you one of the agents of that providence the bargain was concluded i may sacrifice my soul but what matters it added monte cristo if the thing were to do again i would again do it villefort looked at monte cristo with extreme amazement count he inquired have you any relations no sir i am alone in the world so much the worse why asked monte cristo because then you might witness a spectacle calculated to break down your pride you say you fear nothing but death i did not say that i feared it i only said that death alone could check the execution of my plans and old age my end will be achieved before i grow old and madness i have been nearly mad and you know the axiom non bis in idem it is an axiom of criminal law and consequently you understand its full application m sir continued villefort there is something to fear besides death old age and madness for instance there is apoplexy that lightning-stroke which strikes but does not destroy you and yet which brings everything to an end you are still yourself as now and yet you are yourself no longer you who like ariel verge on the angelic are but an inert mass which like caliban verges on the brutal and this is called in human tongues as i tell you neither more nor less than apoplexy come if so you will count and continue this conversation at my house any day you may be willing to see an adversary capable of understanding and anxious to refute you and i will show you my father m noirtier de villefort one of the most fiery jacobins of the french revolution that is to say he had the most remarkable audacity seconded by a most powerful organization a man who has not perhaps like yourself seen all the kingdoms of the earth but who has helped to overturn one of the greatest in fact a man who believed himself like you one of the envoys not of god but of a supreme being not of providence but of fate well sir the rupture of a blood-vessel on the lobe of the brain has destroyed all this not in a day not in an hour but in a second m noirtier who on the previous night was the old jacobin the old senator the old carbonaro laughing at the guillotine the cannon and the dagger m noirtier playing with revolutions m noirtier for whom france was a vast chess-board from which pawns rooks knights and queens were to disappear so that the king was checkmated m noirtier the redoubtable was the next morning poor m noirtier the helpless old man at the tender mercies of the weakest creature in the household that is his grandchild valentine a dumb and frozen carcass in fact living painlessly on that time may be given for his frame to decompose without his consciousness of its decay alas sir said monte cristo this spectacle is neither strange to my eye nor my thought i am something of a physician and have like my fellows sought more than once for the soul in living and in dead matter yet like providence it has remained invisible to my eyes although present to my heart a hundred writers since socrates seneca st augustine and gall have made in verse and prose the comparison you have made and yet i can well understand that a fathers sufferings may effect great changes in the mind
