a dark night the ground from the steps to the river was covered with snow and hoarfrost the water of the river looked black and deep one of the seconds went for a lantern in a coal-barge near and by its light they examined the weapons the presidents sword which was simply as he had said one he carried in his cane was five inches shorter than the generals and had no guard the general proposed to cast lots for the swords but the president said it was he who had given the provocation and when he had given it he had supposed each would use his own arms the witnesses endeavored to insist but the president bade them be silent the lantern was placed on the ground the two adversaries took their stations and the duel began the light made the two swords appear like flashes of lightning as for the men they were scarcely perceptible the darkness was so great m general dpinay passed for one of the best swordsmen in the army but he was pressed so closely in the onset that he missed his aim and fell the witnesses thought he was dead but his adversary who knew he had not struck him offered him the assistance of his hand to rise the circumstance irritated instead of calming the general and he rushed on his adversary but his opponent did not allow his guard to be broken he received him on his sword and three times the general drew back on finding himself too closely engaged and then returned to the charge at the third he fell again they thought he slipped as at first and the witnesses seeing he did not move approached and endeavored to raise him but the one who passed his arm around the body found it was moistened with blood the general who had almost fainted revived ah said he they have sent some fencing-master to fight with me the president without answering approached the witness who held the lantern and raising his sleeve showed him two wounds he had received in his arm then opening his coat and unbuttoning his waistcoat displayed his side pierced with a third wound still he had not even uttered a sigh general dpinay died five minutes after franz read these last words in a voice so choked that they were hardly audible and then stopped passing his hand over his eyes as if to dispel a cloud but after a moments silence he continued the president went up the steps after pushing his sword into his cane a track of blood on the snow marked his course he had scarcely arrived at the top when he heard a heavy splash in the water it was the generals body which the witnesses had just thrown into the river after ascertaining that he was dead the general fell then in a loyal duel and not in ambush as it might have been reported in proof of this we have signed this paper to establish the truth of the facts lest the moment should arrive when either of the actors in this terrible scene should be accused of premeditated murder or of infringement of the laws of honor signed beaurepaire duchampy and lecharpal when franz had finished reading this account so dreadful for a son when valentine pale with emotion had wiped away a tear when villefort trembling and crouched in a corner had endeavored to lessen the storm by supplicating glances at the implacable old man sir said dpinay to noirtier since you are well acquainted with all these details which are attested by honorable signatures since you appear to take some interest in me although you have only manifested it
