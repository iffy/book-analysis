sailors had again hoisted sail and the vessel was once more cleaving the waves through the darkness franz whose eyes were now more accustomed to it could see the looming shore along which the boat was sailing and then as they rounded a rocky point he saw the fire more brilliant than ever and about it five or six persons seated the blaze illumined the sea for a hundred paces around gaetano skirted the light carefully keeping the boat in the shadow then when they were opposite the fire he steered to the centre of the circle singing a fishing song of which his companions sung the chorus at the first words of the song the men seated round the fire arose and approached the landing-place their eyes fixed on the boat evidently seeking to know who the new-comers were and what were their intentions they soon appeared satisfied and returned with the exception of one who remained at the shore to their fire at which the carcass of a goat was roasting when the boat was within twenty paces of the shore the man on the beach who carried a carbine presented arms after the manner of a sentinel and cried who comes there in sardinian franz coolly cocked both barrels gaetano then exchanged a few words with this man which the traveller did not understand but which evidently concerned him will your excellency give your name or remain incognito asked the captain my name must rest unknown replied franz merely say i am a frenchman travelling for pleasure as soon as gaetano had transmitted this answer the sentinel gave an order to one of the men seated round the fire who rose and disappeared among the rocks not a word was spoken everyone seemed occupied franz with his disembarkment the sailors with their sails the smugglers with their goat but in the midst of all this carelessness it was evident that they mutually observed each other the man who had disappeared returned suddenly on the opposite side to that by which he had left he made a sign with his head to the sentinel who turning to the boat said saccommodi the italian saccommodi is untranslatable it means at once come enter you are welcome make yourself at home you are the master it is like that turkish phrase of molires that so astonished the bourgeois gentleman by the number of things implied in its utterance the sailors did not wait for a second invitation four strokes of the oar brought them to land gaetano sprang to shore exchanged a few words with the sentinel then his comrades disembarked and lastly came franz one of his guns was swung over his shoulder gaetano had the other and a sailor held his rifle his dress half artist half dandy did not excite any suspicion and consequently no disquietude the boat was moored to the shore and they advanced a few paces to find a comfortable bivouac but doubtless the spot they chose did not suit the smuggler who filled the post of sentinel for he cried out not that way if you please gaetano faltered an excuse and advanced to the opposite side while two sailors kindled torches at the fire to light them on their way they advanced about thirty paces and then stopped at a small esplanade surrounded with rocks in which seats had been cut not unlike sentry-boxes around in the crevices of the rocks grew a few dwarf oaks and thick bushes of myrtles franz lowered a torch and saw by the mass of cinders that had accumulated that he was not the first to discover this retreat which was doubtless one of the halting-places of the wandering visitors of
