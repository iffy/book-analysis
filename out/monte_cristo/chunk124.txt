the profits were divided and each man had a hundred tuscan livres or about eighty francs but the voyage was not ended they turned the bowsprit towards sardinia where they intended to take in a cargo which was to replace what had been discharged the second operation was as successful as the first la jeune amlie was in luck this new cargo was destined for the coast of the duchy of lucca and consisted almost entirely of havana cigars sherry and malaga wines there they had a bit of a skirmish in getting rid of the duties the excise was in truth the everlasting enemy of the patron of la jeune amlie a customs officer was laid low and two sailors wounded dants was one of the latter a ball having touched him in the left shoulder dants was almost glad of this affray and almost pleased at being wounded for they were rude lessons which taught him with what eye he could view danger and with what endurance he could bear suffering he had contemplated danger with a smile and when wounded had exclaimed with the great philosopher pain thou art not an evil he had moreover looked upon the customs officer wounded to death and whether from heat of blood produced by the encounter or the chill of human sentiment this sight had made but slight impression upon him dants was on the way he desired to follow and was moving towards the end he wished to achieve his heart was in a fair way of petrifying in his bosom jacopo seeing him fall had believed him killed and rushing towards him raised him up and then attended to him with all the kindness of a devoted comrade this world was not then so good as doctor pangloss believed it neither was it so wicked as dants thought it since this man who had nothing to expect from his comrade but the inheritance of his share of the prize-money manifested so much sorrow when he saw him fall fortunately as we have said edmond was only wounded and with certain herbs gathered at certain seasons and sold to the smugglers by the old sardinian women the wound soon closed edmond then resolved to try jacopo and offered him in return for his attention a share of his prize-money but jacopo refused it indignantly as a result of the sympathetic devotion which jacopo had from the first bestowed on edmond the latter was moved to a certain degree of affection but this sufficed for jacopo who instinctively felt that edmond had a right to superiority of position a superiority which edmond had concealed from all others and from this time the kindness which edmond showed him was enough for the brave seaman then in the long days on board ship when the vessel gliding on with security over the azure sea required no care but the hand of the helmsman thanks to the favorable winds that swelled her sails edmond with a chart in his hand became the instructor of jacopo as the poor abb faria had been his tutor he pointed out to him the bearings of the coast explained to him the variations of the compass and taught him to read in that vast book opened over our heads which they call heaven and where god writes in azure with letters of diamonds and when jacopo inquired of him what is the use of teaching all these things to a poor sailor like me edmond replied who knows you may one day be the captain of a vessel your fellow-countryman bonaparte became emperor we had forgotten to say that jacopo was a corsican two months and a half elapsed in these trips
