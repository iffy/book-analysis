honor to the occasion albert de morcerf inhabited a pavilion situated at the corner of a large court and directly opposite another building in which were the servants apartments two windows only of the pavilion faced the street three other windows looked into the court and two at the back into the garden between the court and the garden built in the heavy style of the imperial architecture was the large and fashionable dwelling of the count and countess of morcerf a high wall surrounded the whole of the property surmounted at intervals by vases filled with flowers and broken in the centre by a large gate of gilded iron which served as the carriage entrance a small door close to the lodge of the concierge gave ingress and egress to the servants and masters when they were on foot it was easy to discover that the delicate care of a mother unwilling to part from her son and yet aware that a young man of the viscounts age required the full exercise of his liberty had chosen this habitation for albert there were not lacking however evidences of what we may call the intelligent egoism of a youth who is charmed with the indolent careless life of an only son and who lives as it were in a gilded cage by means of the two windows looking into the street albert could see all that passed the sight of what is going on is necessary to young men who always want to see the world traverse their horizon even if that horizon is only a public thoroughfare then should anything appear to merit a more minute examination albert de morcerf could follow up his researches by means of a small gate similar to that close to the concierges door and which merits a particular description it was a little entrance that seemed never to have been opened since the house was built so entirely was it covered with dust and dirt but the well-oiled hinges and locks told quite another story this door was a mockery to the concierge from whose vigilance and jurisdiction it was free and like that famous portal in the arabian nights opening at the sesame of ali baba it was wont to swing backward at a cabalistic word or a concerted tap from without from the sweetest voices or whitest fingers in the world at the end of a long corridor with which the door communicated and which formed the antechamber was on the right alberts breakfast-room looking into the court and on the left the salon looking into the garden shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows and hid from the garden and court these two apartments the only rooms into which as they were on the ground floor the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate on the floor above were similar rooms with the addition of a third formed out of the antechamber these three rooms were a salon a boudoir and a bedroom the salon downstairs was only an algerian divan for the use of smokers the boudoir upstairs communicated with the bedchamber by an invisible door on the staircase it was evident that every precaution had been taken above this floor was a large atelier which had been increased in size by pulling down the partitions a pandemonium in which the artist and the dandy strove for pre-eminence there were collected and piled up all alberts successive caprices hunting-horns bass-viols flutes a whole orchestra for albert had had not a taste but a fancy for music easels palettes brushes pencils for music had been succeeded by painting foils boxing-gloves broadswords and single-sticks for following the example of the fashionable young men of the time
