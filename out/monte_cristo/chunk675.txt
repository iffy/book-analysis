i owe you some explanations for my conduct and as you are a woman that can perfectly understand me i will give them listen then i received this morning five millions which i paid away almost directly afterwards another demand for the same sum was presented to me i put this creditor off till tomorrow and i intend leaving today to escape that tomorrow which would be rather too unpleasant for me to endure you understand this do you not my most precious wife i say you understand this because you are as conversant with my affairs as i am indeed i think you understand them better since i am ignorant of what has become of a considerable portion of my fortune once very tolerable while i am sure madame that you know perfectly well for women have infallible instincts they can even explain the marvellous by an algebraic calculation they have invented but i who only understand my own figures know nothing more than that one day these figures deceived me have you admired the rapidity of my fall have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden fusion of my ingots i confess i have seen nothing but the fire let us hope you have found some gold among the ashes with this consoling idea i leave you madame and most prudent wife without any conscientious reproach for abandoning you you have friends left and the ashes i have already mentioned and above all the liberty i hasten to restore to you and here madame i must add another word of explanation so long as i hoped you were working for the good of our house and for the fortune of our daughter i philosophically closed my eyes but as you have transformed that house into a vast ruin i will not be the foundation of another mans fortune you were rich when i married you but little respected excuse me for speaking so very candidly but as this is intended only for ourselves i do not see why i should weigh my words i have augmented our fortune and it has continued to increase during the last fifteen years till extraordinary and unexpected catastrophes have suddenly overturned it without any fault of mine i can honestly declare you madame have only sought to increase your own and i am convinced that you have succeeded i leave you therefore as i took you rich but little respected adieu i also intend from this time to work on my own account accept my acknowledgments for the example you have set me and which i intend following your very devoted husband baron danglars the baroness had watched debray while he read this long and painful letter and saw him notwithstanding his self-control change color once or twice when he had ended the perusal he folded the letter and resumed his pensive attitude well asked madame danglars with an anxiety easy to be understood well madame unhesitatingly repeated debray with what ideas does that letter inspire you oh it is simple enough madame it inspires me with the idea that m danglars has left suspiciously certainly but is this all you have to say to me i do not understand you said debray with freezing coldness he is gone gone never to return oh madame do not think that i tell you he will never return i know his character he is inflexible in any resolutions formed for his own interests if he could have made any use of me he would have taken me with him he leaves me in paris as our separation will conduce to his benefit therefore he has gone and i am free forever added madame danglars in the same supplicating
