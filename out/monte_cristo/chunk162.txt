and a most singular change had taken place in his position he had at the same time risen to the rank of cashier and sunk to the rank of a servant he was however the same cocles good patient devoted but inflexible on the subject of arithmetic the only point on which he would have stood firm against the world even against m morrel and strong in the multiplication-table which he had at his fingers ends no matter what scheme or what trap was laid to catch him in the midst of the disasters that befell the house cocles was the only one unmoved but this did not arise from a want of affection on the contrary from a firm conviction like the rats that one by one forsake the doomed ship even before the vessel weighs anchor so all the numerous clerks had by degrees deserted the office and the warehouse cocles had seen them go without thinking of inquiring the cause of their departure everything was as we have said a question of arithmetic to cocles and during twenty years he had always seen all payments made with such exactitude that it seemed as impossible to him that the house should stop payment as it would to a miller that the river that had so long turned his mill should cease to flow nothing had as yet occurred to shake cocles belief the last months payment had been made with the most scrupulous exactitude cocles had detected an overbalance of fourteen sous in his cash and the same evening he had brought them to m morrel who with a melancholy smile threw them into an almost empty drawer saying thanks cocles you are the pearl of cashiers cocles went away perfectly happy for this eulogium of m morrel himself the pearl of the honest men of marseilles flattered him more than a present of fifty crowns but since the end of the month m morrel had passed many an anxious hour in order to meet the payments then due he had collected all his resources and fearing lest the report of his distress should get bruited abroad at marseilles when he was known to be reduced to such an extremity he went to the beaucaire fair to sell his wifes and daughters jewels and a portion of his plate by this means the end of the month was passed but his resources were now exhausted credit owing to the reports afloat was no longer to be had and to meet the one hundred thousand francs due on the th of the present month and the one hundred thousand francs due on the th of the next month to m de boville m morrel had in reality no hope but the return of the pharaon of whose departure he had learnt from a vessel which had weighed anchor at the same time and which had already arrived in harbor but this vessel which like the pharaon came from calcutta had been in for a fortnight while no intelligence had been received of the pharaon m such was the state of affairs when the day after his interview with m de boville the confidential clerk of the house of thomson french of rome presented himself at m morrels emmanuel received him this young man was alarmed by the appearance of every new face for every new face might be that of a new creditor come in anxiety to question the head of the house the young man wishing to spare his employer the pain of this interview questioned the new-comer but the stranger declared that he had nothing to say to m emmanuel and that his business was with m morrel in person emmanuel sighed
