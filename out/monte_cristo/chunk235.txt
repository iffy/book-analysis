towards the three windows the side windows were hung with yellow damask and the centre one with white damask and a red cross the man in the mantle had kept his promise to the transteverin and there could now be no doubt that he was the count the three windows were still untenanted preparations were making on every side chairs were placed scaffolds were raised and windows were hung with flags the masks could not appear the carriages could not move about but the masks were visible behind the windows the carriages and the doors franz albert and the count continued to descend the corso as they approached the piazza del popolo the crowd became more dense and above the heads of the multitude two objects were visible the obelisk surmounted by a cross which marks the centre of the square and in front of the obelisk at the point where the three streets del babuino del corso and di ripetta meet the two uprights of the scaffold between which glittered the curved knife of the mandaa at the corner of the street they met the counts steward who was awaiting his master the window let at an exorbitant price which the count had doubtless wished to conceal from his guests was on the second floor of the great palace situated between the via del babuino and the monte pincio it consisted as we have said of a small dressing-room opening into a bedroom and when the door of communication was shut the inmates were quite alone on chairs were laid elegant masquerade costumes of blue and white satin m as you left the choice of your costumes to me said the count to the two friends i have had these brought as they will be the most worn this year and they are most suitable on account of the confetti sweetmeats as they do not show the flour franz heard the words of the count but imperfectly and he perhaps did not fully appreciate this new attention to their wishes for he was wholly absorbed by the spectacle that the piazza del popolo presented and by the terrible instrument that was in the centre it was the first time franz had ever seen a guillotine we say guillotine because the roman mandaa is formed on almost the same model as the french instrument the knife which is shaped like a crescent that cuts with the convex side falls from a less height and that is all the difference two men seated on the movable plank on which the victim is laid were eating their breakfasts while waiting for the criminal their repast consisted apparently of bread and sausages one of them lifted the plank took out a flask of wine drank some and then passed it to his companion these two men were the executioners assistants at this sight franz felt the perspiration start forth upon his brow the prisoners transported the previous evening from the carceri nuove to the little church of santa maria del popolo had passed the night each accompanied by two priests in a chapel closed by a grating before which were two sentinels who were relieved at intervals a double line of carbineers placed on each side of the door of the church reached to the scaffold and formed a circle around it leaving a path about ten feet wide and around the guillotine a space of nearly a hundred feet all the rest of the square was paved with heads many women held their infants on their shoulders and thus the children had the best view the monte pincio seemed a vast amphitheatre filled with spectators the balconies of the two churches at the corner of the via
