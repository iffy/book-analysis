gloves he said will your excellency deign to open it said the delighted bertuccio and you will find gloves in it elsewhere the count found everything he required smelling-bottles cigars knick-knacks m good he said and m bertuccio left enraptured so great so powerful and real was the influence exercised by this man over all who surrounded him at precisely six oclock the clatter of horses hoofs was heard at the entrance door it was our captain of spahis who had arrived on mdah i am sure i am the first cried morrel i did it on purpose to have you a minute to myself before everyone came julie and emmanuel have a thousand things to tell you ah really this is magnificent but tell me count will your people take care of my horse do not alarm yourself my dear maximilian they understand i mean because he wants petting if you had seen at what a pace he came like the wind i should think so a horse that cost francs said monte cristo in the tone which a father would use towards a son do you regret them asked morrel with his open laugh i certainly not replied the count no i should only regret if the horse had not proved good it is so good that i have distanced m de chteau-renaud one of the best riders in france and m debray who both mount the ministers arabians and close on their heels are the horses of madame danglars who always go at six leagues an hour then they follow you asked monte cristo see they are here and at the same minute a carriage with smoking horses accompanied by two mounted gentlemen arrived at the gate which opened before them the carriage drove round and stopped at the steps followed by the horsemen the instant debray had touched the ground he was at the carriage-door he offered his hand to the baroness who descending took it with a peculiarity of manner imperceptible to everyone but monte cristo but nothing escaped the counts notice and he observed a little note passed with the facility that indicates frequent practice from the hand of madame danglars to that of the ministers secretary after his wife the banker descended as pale as though he had issued from his tomb instead of his carriage madame danglars threw a rapid and inquiring glance which could only be interpreted by monte cristo around the courtyard over the peristyle and across the front of the house then repressing a slight emotion which must have been seen on her countenance if she had not kept her color she ascended the steps saying to morrel sir if you were a friend of mine i should ask you if you would sell your horse morrel smiled with an expression very like a grimace and then turned round to monte cristo as if to ask him to extricate him from his embarrassment the count understood him ah madame he said why did you not make that request of me with you sir replied the baroness one can wish for nothing one is so sure to obtain it if it were so with m morrel unfortunately replied the count i am witness that m morrel cannot give up his horse his honor being engaged in keeping it how so he laid a wager he would tame mdah in the space of six months you understand now that if he were to get rid of the animal before the time named he would not only lose his bet but people would say he was afraid and a brave captain of spahis cannot risk this even to gratify a pretty woman which is in my opinion
