a post as that you have now the good fortune to fill i neither ill-use nor ill-treat my servants by word or action an error i readily forgive but wilful negligence or forgetfulness never my commands are ordinarily short clear and precise and i would rather be obliged to repeat my words twice or even three times than they should be misunderstood i am rich enough to know whatever i desire to know and i can promise you i am not wanting in curiosity if then i should learn that you had taken upon yourself to speak of me to anyone favorably or unfavorably to comment on my actions or watch my conduct that very instant you would quit my service you may now retire i never caution my servants a second time remember that baptistin bowed and was proceeding towards the door i forgot to mention to you said the count that i lay yearly aside a certain sum for each servant in my establishment those whom i am compelled to dismiss lose as a matter of course all participation in this money while their portion goes to the fund accumulating for those domestics who remain with me and among whom it will be divided at my death you have been in my service a year your fund has already begun to accumulate let it continue to do so this address delivered in the presence of ali who not understanding one word of the language in which it was spoken stood wholly unmoved produced an effect on m baptistin only to be conceived by such as have occasion to study the character and disposition of french domestics i assure your excellency said he that at least it shall be my study to merit your approbation in all things and i will take m ali as my model by no means replied the count in the most frigid tones ali has many faults mixed with most excellent qualities he cannot possibly serve you as a pattern for your conduct not being as you are a paid servant but a mere slave a dog who should he fail in his duty towards me i should not discharge from my service but kill baptistin opened his eyes with astonishment you seem incredulous said monte cristo who repeated to ali in the arabic language what he had just been saying to baptistin in french the nubian smiled assentingly to his masters words then kneeling on one knee respectfully kissed the hand of the count this corroboration of the lesson he had just received put the finishing stroke to the wonder and stupefaction of m baptistin the count then motioned the valet de chambre to retire and to ali to follow to his study where they conversed long and earnestly together as the hand of the clock pointed to five the count struck thrice upon his gong when ali was wanted one stroke was given two summoned baptistin and three bertuccio the steward entered my horses said monte cristo they are at the door harnessed to the carriage as your excellency desired does your excellency wish me to accompany him no the coachman ali and baptistin will go the count descended to the door of his mansion and beheld his carriage drawn by the very pair of horses he had so much admired in the morning as the property of danglars as he passed them he said they are extremely handsome certainly and you have done well to purchase them although you were somewhat remiss not to have procured them sooner indeed your excellency i had very considerable difficulty in obtaining them and as it is they have cost an enormous price does the sum you gave for them
