unexpected visit signified a desire to make up for the sharp words he had uttered during the day assuming a dignified air she turned round to debray without answering her husband read me something m debray she said debray who was slightly disturbed at this visit recovered himself when he saw the calmness of the baroness and took up a book marked by a mother-of-pearl knife inlaid with gold excuse me said the banker but you will tire yourself baroness by such late hours and m debray lives some distance from here debray was petrified not only to hear danglars speak so calmly and politely but because it was apparent that beneath outward politeness there really lurked a determined spirit of opposition to anything his wife might wish to do the baroness was also surprised and showed her astonishment by a look which would doubtless have had some effect upon her husband if he had not been intently occupied with the paper where he was looking to see the closing stock quotations the result was that the proud look entirely failed of its purpose m lucien said the baroness i assure you i have no desire to sleep and that i have a thousand things to tell you this evening which you must listen to even though you slept while hearing me i am at your service madame replied lucien coldly my dear m debray said the banker do not kill yourself tonight listening to the follies of madame danglars for you can hear them as well tomorrow but i claim tonight and will devote it if you will allow me to talk over some serious matters with my wife this time the blow was so well aimed and hit so directly that lucien and the baroness were staggered and they interrogated each other with their eyes as if to seek help against this aggression but the irresistible will of the master of the house prevailed and the husband was victorious do not think i wish to turn you out my dear debray continued danglars oh no not at all an unexpected occurrence forces me to ask my wife to have a little conversation with me it is so rarely i make such a request i am sure you cannot grudge it to me debray muttered something bowed and went out knocking himself against the edge of the door like nathan in athalie it is extraordinary he said when the door was closed behind him how easily these husbands whom we ridicule gain an advantage over us m lucien having left danglars took his place on the sofa closed the open book and placing himself in a dreadfully dictatorial attitude he began playing with the dog but the animal not liking him as well as debray and attempting to bite him danglars seized him by the skin of his neck and threw him upon a couch on the other side of the room the animal uttered a cry during the transit but arrived at its destination it crouched behind the cushions and stupefied at such unusual treatment remained silent and motionless do you know sir asked the baroness that you are improving generally you are only rude but tonight you are brutal it is because i am in a worse humor than usual replied danglars hermine looked at the banker with supreme disdain these glances frequently exasperated the pride of danglars but this evening he took no notice of them and what have i to do with your ill-humor said the baroness irritated at the impassibility of her husband do these things concern me keep your ill-humor at home in your money boxes or since you have clerks whom you pay vent it upon them
