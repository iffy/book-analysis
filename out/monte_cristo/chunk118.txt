of the chteau dif uttered this prayer he saw off the farther point of the island of pomgue a small vessel with lateen sail skimming the sea like a gull in search of prey and with his sailors eye he knew it to be a genoese tartan she was coming out of marseilles harbor and was standing out to sea rapidly her sharp prow cleaving through the waves oh cried edmond to think that in half an hour i could join her did i not fear being questioned detected and conveyed back to marseilles what can i do what story can i invent under pretext of trading along the coast these men who are in reality smugglers will prefer selling me to doing a good action i must wait but i cannot i am starving in a few hours my strength will be utterly exhausted besides perhaps i have not been missed at the fortress i can pass as one of the sailors wrecked last night my story will be accepted for there is no one left to contradict me as he spoke dants looked toward the spot where the fishing-vessel had been wrecked and started the red cap of one of the sailors hung to a point of the rock and some timbers that had formed part of the vessels keel floated at the foot of the crag in an instant dants plan was formed he swam to the cap placed it on his head seized one of the timbers and struck out so as to cut across the course the vessel was taking i am saved murmured he and this conviction restored his strength he soon saw that the vessel with the wind dead ahead was tacking between the chteau dif and the tower of planier for an instant he feared lest instead of keeping in shore she should stand out to sea but he soon saw that she would pass like most vessels bound for italy between the islands of jaros and calaseraigne however the vessel and the swimmer insensibly neared one another and in one of its tacks the tartan bore down within a quarter of a mile of him he rose on the waves making signs of distress but no one on board saw him and the vessel stood on another tack dants would have shouted but he knew that the wind would drown his voice it was then he rejoiced at his precaution in taking the timber for without it he would have been unable perhaps to reach the vessel certainly to return to shore should he be unsuccessful in attracting attention dants though almost sure as to what course the vessel would take had yet watched it anxiously until it tacked and stood towards him then he advanced but before they could meet the vessel again changed her course by a violent effort he rose half out of the water waving his cap and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailors this time he was both seen and heard and the tartan instantly steered towards him at the same time he saw they were about to lower the boat an instant after the boat rowed by two men advanced rapidly towards him dants let go of the timber which he now thought to be useless and swam vigorously to meet them but he had reckoned too much upon his strength and then he realized how serviceable the timber had been to him his arms became stiff his legs lost their flexibility and he was almost breathless he shouted again the two sailors redoubled their efforts and one of them cried in italian courage the word reached his ear as a wave which he no longer had the strength
