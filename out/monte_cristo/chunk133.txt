he who compared italy to an artichoke which he could devour leaf by leaf knew too well the value of time to waste it in replacing this rock i will go down then he descended a smile on his lips and murmuring that last word of human philosophy perhaps but instead of the darkness and the thick and mephitic atmosphere he had expected to find dants saw a dim and bluish light which as well as the air entered not merely by the aperture he had just formed but by the interstices and crevices of the rock which were visible from without and through which he could distinguish the blue sky and the waving branches of the evergreen oaks and the tendrils of the creepers that grew from the rocks after having stood a few minutes in the cavern the atmosphere of which was rather warm than damp dants eye habituated as it was to darkness could pierce even to the remotest angles of the cavern which was of granite that sparkled like diamonds alas said edmond smiling these are the treasures the cardinal has left and the good abb seeing in a dream these glittering walls has indulged in fallacious hopes but he called to mind the words of the will which he knew by heart in the farthest angle of the second opening said the cardinals will he had only found the first grotto he had now to seek the second dants continued his search he reflected that this second grotto must penetrate deeper into the island he examined the stones and sounded one part of the wall where he fancied the opening existed masked for precautions sake the pickaxe struck for a moment with a dull sound that drew out of dants forehead large drops of perspiration at last it seemed to him that one part of the wall gave forth a more hollow and deeper echo he eagerly advanced and with the quickness of perception that no one but a prisoner possesses saw that there in all probability the opening must be however he like csar borgia knew the value of time and in order to avoid fruitless toil he sounded all the other walls with his pickaxe struck the earth with the butt of his gun and finding nothing that appeared suspicious returned to that part of the wall whence issued the consoling sound he had before heard he again struck it and with greater force then a singular thing occurred as he struck the wall pieces of stucco similar to that used in the ground work of arabesques broke off and fell to the ground in flakes exposing a large white stone the aperture of the rock had been closed with stones then this stucco had been applied and painted to imitate granite dants struck with the sharp end of his pickaxe which entered someway between the interstices it was there he must dig but by some strange play of emotion in proportion as the proofs that faria had not been deceived became stronger so did his heart give way and a feeling of discouragement stole over him this last proof instead of giving him fresh strength deprived him of it the pickaxe descended or rather fell he placed it on the ground passed his hand over his brow and remounted the stairs alleging to himself as an excuse a desire to be assured that no one was watching him but in reality because he felt that he was about to faint the island was deserted and the sun seemed to cover it with its fiery glance afar off a few small fishing boats studded the bosom of the blue ocean dants had tasted nothing but he thought not
