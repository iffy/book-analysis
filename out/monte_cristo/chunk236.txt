del babuino and the via di ripetta were crammed the steps even seemed a parti-colored sea that was impelled towards the portico every niche in the wall held its living statue what the count said was true the most curious spectacle in life is that of death and yet instead of the silence and the solemnity demanded by the occasion laughter and jests arose from the crowd it was evident that the execution was in the eyes of the people only the commencement of the carnival suddenly the tumult ceased as if by magic and the doors of the church opened a brotherhood of penitents clothed from head to foot in robes of gray sackcloth with holes for the eyes and holding in their hands lighted tapers appeared first the chief marched at the head m behind the penitents came a man of vast stature and proportions he was naked with the exception of cloth drawers at the left side of which hung a large knife in a sheath and he bore on his right shoulder a heavy iron sledge-hammer this man was the executioner he had moreover sandals bound on his feet by cords behind the executioner came in the order in which they were to die first peppino and then andrea each was accompanied by two priests neither had his eyes bandaged peppino walked with a firm step doubtless aware of what awaited him andrea was supported by two priests each of them from time to time kissed the crucifix a confessor held out to them at this sight alone franz felt his legs tremble under him he looked at albert he was as white as his shirt and mechanically cast away his cigar although he had not half smoked it the count alone seemed unmoved nay more a slight color seemed striving to rise in his pale cheeks his nostrils dilated like those of a wild beast that scents its prey and his lips half opened disclosed his white teeth small and sharp like those of a jackal and yet his features wore an expression of smiling tenderness such as franz had never before witnessed in them his black eyes especially were full of kindness and pity however the two culprits advanced and as they approached their faces became visible peppino was a handsome young man of four or five-and-twenty bronzed by the sun he carried his head erect and seemed on the watch to see on which side his liberator would appear andrea was short and fat his visage marked with brutal cruelty did not indicate age he might be thirty in prison he had suffered his beard to grow his head fell on his shoulder his legs bent beneath him and his movements were apparently automatic and unconscious i thought said franz to the count that you told me there would be but one execution i told you true replied he coldly and yet here are two culprits yes but only one of these two is about to die the other has many years to live if the pardon is to come there is no time to lose and see here it is said the count at the moment when peppino reached the foot of the mandaa a priest arrived in some haste forced his way through the soldiers and advancing to the chief of the brotherhood gave him a folded paper the piercing eye of peppino had noticed all the chief took the paper unfolded it and raising his hand heaven be praised and his holiness also said he in a loud voice here is a pardon for one of the prisoners a pardon cried the people with one voice a pardon at this cry andrea raised his head
