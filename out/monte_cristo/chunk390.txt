touched me to the quick indeed his griefs hopes and fears on that subject might furnish material for a most touching and pathetic poem at length he one day received a letter stating that the abductors of his son now offered to restore him or at least to give notice where he might be found on condition of receiving a large sum of money by way of ransom your father did not hesitate an instant and the sum was sent to the frontier of piedmont with a passport signed for italy you were in the south of france i think yes replied andrea with an embarrassed air i was in the south of france a carriage was to await you at nice precisely so and it conveyed me from nice to genoa from genoa to turin from turin to chambry from chambry to pont-de-beauvoisin and from pont-de-beauvoisin to paris m indeed then your father ought to have met with you on the road for it is exactly the same route which he himself took and that is how we have been able to trace your journey to this place but said andrea if my father had met me i doubt if he would have recognized me i must be somewhat altered since he last saw me oh the voice of nature said monte cristo true interrupted the young man i had not looked upon it in that light now replied monte cristo there is only one source of uneasiness left in your fathers mind which is this he is anxious to know how you have been employed during your long absence from him how you have been treated by your persecutors and if they have conducted themselves towards you with all the deference due to your rank finally he is anxious to see if you have been fortunate enough to escape the bad moral influence to which you have been exposed and which is infinitely more to be dreaded than any physical suffering he wishes to discover if the fine abilities with which nature had endowed you have been weakened by want of culture and in short whether you consider yourself capable of resuming and retaining in the world the high position to which your rank entitles you sir exclaimed the young man quite astounded i hope no false report as for myself i first heard you spoken of by my friend wilmore the philanthropist i believe he found you in some unpleasant position but do not know of what nature for i did not ask not being inquisitive your misfortunes engaged his sympathies so you see you must have been interesting he told me that he was anxious to restore you to the position which you had lost and that he would seek your father until he found him he did seek and has found him apparently since he is here now and finally my friend apprised me of your coming and gave me a few other instructions relative to your future fortune i am quite aware that my friend wilmore is peculiar but he is sincere and as rich as a gold mine consequently he may indulge his eccentricities without any fear of their ruining him and i have promised to adhere to his instructions now sir pray do not be offended at the question i am about to put to you as it comes in the way of my duty as your patron i would wish to know if the misfortunes which have happened to you misfortunes entirely beyond your control and which in no degree diminish my regard for you i would wish to know if they have not in some measure contributed to render you a stranger to the world
