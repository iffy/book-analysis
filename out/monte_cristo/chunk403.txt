terrified at her own sensations chapter m noirtier de villefort we will now relate what was passing in the house of the kings attorney after the departure of madame danglars and her daughter and during the time of the conversation between maximilian and valentine which we have just detailed m de villefort entered his fathers room followed by madame de villefort both of the visitors after saluting the old man and speaking to barrois a faithful servant who had been twenty-five years in his service took their places on either side of the paralytic m noirtier was sitting in an armchair which moved upon casters in which he was wheeled into the room in the morning and in the same way drawn out again at night he was placed before a large glass which reflected the whole apartment and so without any attempt to move which would have been impossible he could see all who entered the room and everything which was going on around him m noirtier although almost as immovable as a corpse looked at the new-comers with a quick and intelligent expression perceiving at once by their ceremonious courtesy that they were come on business of an unexpected and official character sight and hearing were the only senses remaining and they like two solitary sparks remained to animate the miserable body which seemed fit for nothing but the grave it was only however by means of one of these senses that he could reveal the thoughts and feelings that still occupied his mind and the look by which he gave expression to his inner life was like the distant gleam of a candle which a traveller sees by night across some desert place and knows that a living being dwells beyond the silence and obscurity noirtiers hair was long and white and flowed over his shoulders while in his eyes shaded by thick black lashes was concentrated as it often happens with an organ which is used to the exclusion of the others all the activity address force and intelligence which were formerly diffused over his whole body and so although the movement of the arm the sound of the voice and the agility of the body were wanting the speaking eye sufficed for all he commanded with it it was the medium through which his thanks were conveyed in short his whole appearance produced on the mind the impression of a corpse with living eyes and nothing could be more startling than to observe the expression of anger or joy suddenly lighting up these organs while the rest of the rigid and marble-like features were utterly deprived of the power of participation three persons only could understand this language of the poor paralytic these were villefort valentine and the old servant of whom we have already spoken but as villefort saw his father but seldom and then only when absolutely obliged and as he never took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there all the old mans happiness was centred in his granddaughter valentine by means of her love her patience and her devotion had learned to read in noirtiers look all the varied feelings which were passing in his mind to this dumb language which was so unintelligible to others she answered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her countenance and in this manner were the conversations sustained between the blooming girl and the helpless invalid whose body could scarcely be called a living one but who nevertheless possessed a fund of knowledge and penetration united with a will as powerful as ever although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying its impulses valentine had solved the problem and was able
