came it known i suppose you read it in the paper in the account from yanina who wrote to yanina to yanina yes who wrote for particulars concerning my father i imagine anyone may write to yanina but one person only wrote one only yes and that was you i doubtless wrote it appears to me that when about to marry your daughter to a young man it is right to make some inquiries respecting his family it is not only a right but a duty you wrote sir knowing what answer you would receive i indeed i assure you cried danglars with a confidence and security proceeding less from fear than from the interest he really felt for the young man i solemnly declare to you that i should never have thought of writing to yanina did i know anything of ali pashas misfortunes who then urged you to write tell me pardieu it was the most simple thing in the world i was speaking of your fathers past history i said the origin of his fortune remained obscure the person to whom i addressed my scruples asked me where your father had acquired his property i answered in greece then said he write to yanina and who thus advised you no other than your friend monte cristo the count of monte cristo told you to write to yanina yes and i wrote and will show you my correspondence if you like albert and beauchamp looked at each other sir said beauchamp who had not yet spoken you appear to accuse the count who is absent from paris at this moment and cannot justify himself i accuse no one sir said danglars i relate and i will repeat before the count what i have said to you does the count know what answer you received yes i showed it to him did he know my fathers christian name was fernand and his family name mondego yes i had told him that long since and i did only what any other would have done in my circumstances and perhaps less when the day after the arrival of this answer your father came by the advice of monte cristo to ask my daughters hand for you i decidedly refused him but without any explanation or exposure in short why should i have any more to do with the affair how did the honor or disgrace of m de morcerf affect me it neither increased nor decreased my income albert felt the blood mounting to his brow there was no doubt upon the subject danglars defended himself with the baseness but at the same time with the assurance of a man who speaks the truth at least in part if not wholly not for conscience sake but through fear besides what was morcerf seeking it was not whether danglars or monte cristo was more or less guilty it was a man who would answer for the offence whether trifling or serious it was a man who would fight and it was evident danglars would not fight in addition to this everything forgotten or unperceived before presented itself now to his recollection monte cristo knew everything as he had bought the daughter of ali pasha and knowing everything he had advised danglars to write to yanina the answer known he had yielded to alberts wish to be introduced to hayde and allowed the conversation to turn on the death of ali and had not opposed haydes recital but having doubtless warned the young girl in the few romaic words he spoke to her not to implicate morcerfs father besides had he not begged of morcerf not to mention his fathers name before hayde lastly he had taken albert
