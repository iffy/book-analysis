a living body for a corpse as he thus reasoned monte cristo walked down the rue de la caisserie it was the same through which twenty-four years ago he had been conducted by a silent and nocturnal guard the houses today so smiling and animated were on that night dark mute and closed and yet they were the same murmured monte cristo only now it is broad daylight instead of night it is the sun which brightens the place and makes it appear so cheerful he proceeded towards the quay by the rue saint-laurent and advanced to the consigne it was the point where he had embarked a pleasure-boat with striped awning was going by monte cristo called the owner who immediately rowed up to him with the eagerness of a boatman hoping for a good fare the weather was magnificent and the excursion a treat the sun red and flaming was sinking into the embrace of the welcoming ocean the sea smooth as crystal was now and then disturbed by the leaping of fish which were pursued by some unseen enemy and sought for safety in another element while on the extreme verge of the horizon might be seen the fishermens boats white and graceful as the sea-gull or the merchant vessels bound for corsica or spain but notwithstanding the serene sky the gracefully formed boats and the golden light in which the whole scene was bathed the count of monte cristo wrapped in his cloak could think only of this terrible voyage the details of which were one by one recalled to his memory the solitary light burning at the catalans that first sight of the chteau dif which told him whither they were leading him the struggle with the gendarmes when he wished to throw himself overboard his despair when he found himself vanquished and the sensation when the muzzle of the carbine touched his forehead all these were brought before him in vivid and frightful reality like the streams which the heat of the summer has dried up and which after the autumnal storms gradually begin oozing drop by drop so did the count feel his heart gradually fill with the bitterness which formerly nearly overwhelmed edmond dants clear sky swift-flitting boats and brilliant sunshine disappeared the heavens were hung with black and the gigantic structure of the chteau dif seemed like the phantom of a mortal enemy as they reached the shore the count instinctively shrunk to the extreme end of the boat and the owner was obliged to call out in his sweetest tone of voice sir we are at the landing monte cristo remembered that on that very spot on the same rock he had been violently dragged by the guards who forced him to ascend the slope at the points of their bayonets the journey had seemed very long to dants but monte cristo found it equally short each stroke of the oar seemed to awaken a new throng of ideas which sprang up with the flying spray of the sea m there had been no prisoners confined in the chteau dif since the revolution of july it was only inhabited by a guard kept there for the prevention of smuggling a concierge waited at the door to exhibit to visitors this monument of curiosity once a scene of terror the count inquired whether any of the ancient jailers were still there but they had all been pensioned or had passed on to some other employment the concierge who attended him had only been there since he visited his own dungeon he again beheld the dull light vainly endeavoring to penetrate the narrow opening his eyes rested upon the spot where had stood his bed since
