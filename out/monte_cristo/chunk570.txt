precisely said the count six years since i bought a horse in hungary remarkable for its swiftness the thirty-two that we shall use tonight are its progeny they are all entirely black with the exception of a star upon the forehead that is perfectly admirable but what do you do count with all these horses you see i travel with them but you are not always travelling when i no longer require them bertuccio will sell them and he expects to realize thirty or forty thousand francs by the sale but no monarch in europe will be wealthy enough to purchase them then he will sell them to some eastern vizier who will empty his coffers to purchase them and refill them by applying the bastinado to his subjects count may i suggest one idea to you certainly it is that next to you bertuccio must be the richest gentleman in europe you are mistaken viscount i believe he has not a franc in his possession then he must be a wonder my dear count if you tell me many more marvellous things i warn you i shall not believe them i countenance nothing that is marvellous m albert tell me why does a steward rob his master because i suppose it is his nature to do so for the love of robbing you are mistaken it is because he has a wife and family and ambitious desires for himself and them also because he is not sure of always retaining his situation and wishes to provide for the future now m bertuccio is alone in the world he uses my property without accounting for the use he makes of it he is sure never to leave my service why because i should never get a better probabilities are deceptive but i deal in certainties he is the best servant over whom one has the power of life and death do you possess that right over bertuccio yes there are words which close a conversation with an iron door such was the counts yes the whole journey was performed with equal rapidity the thirty-two horses dispersed over seven stages brought them to their destination in eight hours at midnight they arrived at the gate of a beautiful park the porter was in attendance he had been apprised by the groom of the last stage of the counts approach at half past two in the morning morcerf was conducted to his apartments where a bath and supper were prepared the servant who had travelled at the back of the carriage waited on him baptistin who rode in front attended the count albert bathed took his supper and went to bed all night he was lulled by the melancholy noise of the surf on rising he went to his window which opened on a terrace having the sea in front and at the back a pretty park bounded by a small forest in a creek lay a little sloop with a narrow keel and high masts bearing on its flag the monte cristo arms which were a mountain or on a sea azure with a cross gules in chief which might be an allusion to his name that recalled calvary the mount rendered by our lords passion more precious than gold and to the degrading cross which his blood had rendered holy or it might be some personal remembrance of suffering and regeneration buried in the night of this mysterious personages past life around the schooner lay a number of small fishing-boats belonging to the fishermen of the neighboring village like humble subjects awaiting orders from their queen there as in every spot where monte cristo stopped if but for two days luxury abounded and life went
