along the floor and he soon made his appearance in the room noirtier acknowledged by a look of extreme kindness and benevolence the thanks which morrel lavished on him for his timely intervention on behalf of valentine and himself an intervention which had saved them from despair morrel then cast on the invalid an interrogative look as to the new favor which he designed to bestow on him valentine was sitting at a little distance from them timidly awaiting the moment when she should be obliged to speak noirtier fixed his eyes on her am i to say what you told me asked valentine noirtier made a sign that she was to do so monsieur morrel said valentine to the young man who was regarding her with the most intense interest my grandfather m noirtier had a thousand things to say which he told me three days ago and now he has sent for you that i may repeat them to you i will repeat them then and since he has chosen me as his interpreter i will be faithful to the trust and will not alter a word of his intentions oh i am listening with the greatest impatience replied the young man speak i beg of you valentine cast down her eyes this was a good omen for morrel for he knew that nothing but happiness could have the power of thus overcoming valentine my grandfather intends leaving this house said she and barrois is looking out for suitable apartments for him in another but you mademoiselle de villefort you who are necessary to m noirtiers happiness i interrupted valentine i shall not leave my grandfather that is an understood thing between us my apartment will be close to his now m de villefort must either give his consent to this plan or his refusal in the first case i shall leave directly and in the second i shall wait till i am of age which will be in about ten months then i shall be free i shall have an independent fortune and and what demanded morrel and with my grandfathers consent i shall fulfil the promise which i have made you valentine pronounced these last few words in such a low tone that nothing but morrels intense interest in what she was saying could have enabled him to hear them have i not explained your wishes grandpapa said valentine addressing noirtier yes looked the old man once under my grandfathers roof m morrel can visit me in the presence of my good and worthy protector if we still feel that the union we contemplated will be likely to insure our future comfort and happiness in that case i shall expect m morrel to come and claim me at my own hands but alas i have heard it said that hearts inflamed by obstacles to their desire grew cold in time of security i trust we shall never find it so in our experience oh cried morrel almost tempted to throw himself on his knees before noirtier and valentine and to adore them as two superior beings what have i ever done in my life to merit such unbounded happiness until that time continued the young girl in a calm and self-possessed tone of voice we will conform to circumstances and be guided by the wishes of our friends so long as those wishes do not tend finally to separate us in a word and i repeat it because it expresses all i wish to convey we will wait and i swear to make all the sacrifices which this word imposes sir said morrel not only with resignation but with cheerfulness therefore continued valentine looking playfully at maximilian no more inconsiderate actions
