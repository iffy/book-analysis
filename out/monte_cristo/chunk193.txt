animals though wild and agile as chamois were too much like domestic goats and franz could not consider them as game moreover other ideas much more enthralling occupied his mind since the evening before he had really been the hero of one of the tales of the thousand and one nights and he was irresistibly attracted towards the grotto then in spite of the failure of his first search he began a second after having told gaetano to roast one of the two kids the second visit was a long one and when he returned the kid was roasted and the repast ready franz was sitting on the spot where he was on the previous evening when his mysterious host had invited him to supper and he saw the little yacht now like a sea-gull on the wave continuing her flight towards corsica why he remarked to gaetano you told me that signor sinbad was going to malaga while it seems he is in the direction of porto-vecchio dont you remember said the patron i told you that among the crew there were two corsican brigands true and he is going to land them added franz precisely so replied gaetano ah he is one who fears neither god nor satan they say and would at any time run fifty leagues out of his course to do a poor devil a service m but such services as these might involve him with the authorities of the country in which he practices this kind of philanthropy said franz and what cares he for that replied gaetano with a laugh or any authorities he smiles at them let them try to pursue him why in the first place his yacht is not a ship but a bird and he would beat any frigate three knots in every nine and if he were to throw himself on the coast why is he not certain of finding friends everywhere it was perfectly clear that the signor sinbad franzs host had the honor of being on excellent terms with the smugglers and bandits along the whole coast of the mediterranean and so enjoyed exceptional privileges as to franz he had no longer any inducement to remain at monte cristo he had lost all hope of detecting the secret of the grotto he consequently despatched his breakfast and his boat being ready he hastened on board and they were soon under way at the moment the boat began her course they lost sight of the yacht as it disappeared in the gulf of porto-vecchio with it was effaced the last trace of the preceding night and then supper sinbad hashish statues all became a dream for franz the boat sailed on all day and all night and next morning when the sun rose they had lost sight of monte cristo when franz had once again set foot on shore he forgot for the moment at least the events which had just passed while he finished his affairs of pleasure at florence and then thought of nothing but how he should rejoin his companion who was awaiting him at rome he set out and on the saturday evening reached the place de la douane by the mail-coach an apartment as we have said had been retained beforehand and thus he had but to go to signor pastrinis hotel but this was not so easy a matter for the streets were thronged with people and rome was already a prey to that low and feverish murmur which precedes all great events and at rome there are four great events in every year the carnival holy week corpus christi and the feast of st peter all the rest of the year the city is in
