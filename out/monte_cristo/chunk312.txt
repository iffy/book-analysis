the men keep your innocent stories to tell to the judge at nmes meanwhile come along with us and the best advice we can give you is to do so unresistingly alas resistance was far from my thoughts i was utterly overpowered by surprise and terror and without a word i suffered myself to be handcuffed and tied to a horses tail and thus they took me to nmes i had been tracked by a customs-officer who had lost sight of me near the tavern feeling certain that i intended to pass the night there he had returned to summon his comrades who just arrived in time to hear the report of the pistol and to take me in the midst of such circumstantial proofs of my guilt as rendered all hopes of proving my innocence utterly futile one only chance was left me that of beseeching the magistrate before whom i was taken to cause every inquiry to be made for the abb busoni who had stopped at the inn of the pont du gard on that morning if caderousse had invented the story relative to the diamond and there existed no such person as the abb busoni then indeed i was lost past redemption or at least my life hung upon the feeble chance of caderousse himself being apprehended and confessing the whole truth two months passed away in hopeless expectation on my part while i must do the magistrate the justice to say that he used every means to obtain information of the person i declared could exculpate me if he would caderousse still evaded all pursuit and i had resigned myself to what seemed my inevitable fate my trial was to come on at the approaching assizes when on the th of september that is to say precisely three months and five days after the events which had perilled my life the abb busoni whom i never ventured to believe i should see presented himself at the prison doors saying he understood one of the prisoners wished to speak to him he added that having learned at marseilles the particulars of my imprisonment he hastened to comply with my desire you may easily imagine with what eagerness i welcomed him and how minutely i related the whole of what i had seen and heard i felt some degree of nervousness as i entered upon the history of the diamond but to my inexpressible astonishment he confirmed it in every particular and to my equal surprise he seemed to place entire belief in all i said and then it was that won by his mild charity seeing that he was acquainted with all the habits and customs of my own country and considering also that pardon for the only crime of which i was really guilty might come with a double power from lips so benevolent and kind i besought him to receive my confession under the seal of which i recounted the auteuil affair in all its details as well as every other transaction of my life that which i had done by the impulse of my best feelings produced the same effect as though it had been the result of calculation my voluntary confession of the assassination at auteuil proved to him that i had not committed that of which i stood accused when he quitted me he bade me be of good courage and to rely upon his doing all in his power to convince my judges of my innocence i had speedy proofs that the excellent abb was engaged in my behalf for the rigors of my imprisonment were alleviated by many trifling though acceptable indulgences and i was told that my trial was to be postponed to
