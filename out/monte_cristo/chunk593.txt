that if my face is pale if my eyes are dull if my beauty is gone if mercds in short no longer resembles her former self in her features you will see that her heart is still the same adieu then edmond i have nothing more to ask of heaven i have seen you again and have found you as noble and as great as formerly you were adieu edmond adieu and thank you but the count did not answer mercds opened the door of the study and had disappeared before he had recovered from the painful and profound reverie into which his thwarted vengeance had plunged him the clock of the invalides struck one when the carriage which conveyed madame de morcerf rolled away on the pavement of the champs-lyses and made monte cristo raise his head what a fool i was said he not to tear my heart out on the day when i resolved to avenge myself chapter the meeting after mercds had left monte cristo he fell into profound gloom around him and within him the flight of thought seemed to have stopped his energetic mind slumbered as the body does after extreme fatigue what said he to himself while the lamp and the wax lights were nearly burnt out and the servants were waiting impatiently in the anteroom what this edifice which i have been so long preparing which i have reared with so much care and toil is to be crushed by a single touch a word a breath yes this self of whom i thought so much of whom i was so proud who had appeared so worthless in the dungeons of the chteau dif and whom i had succeeded in making so great will be but a lump of clay tomorrow alas it is not the death of the body i regret for is not the destruction of the vital principle the repose to which everything is tending to which every unhappy being aspires is not this the repose of matter after which i so long sighed and which i was seeking to attain by the painful process of starvation when faria appeared in my dungeon what is death for me one step farther into rest two perhaps into silence no it is not existence then that i regret but the ruin of projects so slowly carried out so laboriously framed providence is now opposed to them when i most thought it would be propitious it is not gods will that they should be accomplished this burden almost as heavy as a world which i had raised and i had thought to bear to the end was too great for my strength and i was compelled to lay it down in the middle of my career oh shall i then again become a fatalist whom fourteen years of despair and ten of hope had rendered a believer in providence and all this all this because my heart which i thought dead was only sleeping because it has awakened and has begun to beat again because i have yielded to the pain of the emotion excited in my breast by a womans voice yet continued the count becoming each moment more absorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow which mercds had accepted yet it is impossible that so noble-minded a woman should thus through selfishness consent to my death when i am in the prime of life and strength it is impossible that she can carry to such a point maternal love or rather delirium there are virtues which become crimes by exaggeration no she must have conceived some pathetic scene she will come and throw herself between us and what would be sublime
