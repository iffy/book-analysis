than mere fascination andrea made no resistance although he protested against it suddenly a voice was heard at the wicket benedetto exclaimed an inspector the keeper relaxed his hold i am called said andrea to the visitors room said the same voice you see someone pays me a visit ah my dear sir you will see whether a cavalcanti is to be treated like a common person and andrea gliding through the court like a black shadow rushed out through the wicket leaving his comrades and even the keeper lost in wonder certainly a call to the visitors room had scarcely astonished andrea less than themselves for the wily youth instead of making use of his privilege of waiting to be claimed on his entry into la force had maintained a rigid silence m everything he said proves me to be under the protection of some powerful person this sudden fortune the facility with which i have overcome all obstacles an unexpected family and an illustrious name awarded to me gold showered down upon me and the most splendid alliances about to be entered into an unhappy lapse of fortune and the absence of my protector have cast me down certainly but not forever the hand which has retreated for a while will be again stretched forth to save me at the very moment when i shall think myself sinking into the abyss why should i risk an imprudent step it might alienate my protector he has two means of extricating me from this dilemma the one by a mysterious escape managed through bribery the other by buying off my judges with gold i will say and do nothing until i am convinced that he has quite abandoned me and then andrea had formed a plan which was tolerably clever the unfortunate youth was intrepid in the attack and rude in the defence he had borne with the public prison and with privations of all sorts still by degrees nature or rather custom had prevailed and he suffered from being naked dirty and hungry it was at this moment of discomfort that the inspectors voice called him to the visiting-room andrea felt his heart leap with joy it was too soon for a visit from the examining magistrate and too late for one from the director of the prison or the doctor it must then be the visitor he hoped for behind the grating of the room into which andrea had been led he saw while his eyes dilated with surprise the dark and intelligent face of m bertuccio who was also gazing with sad astonishment upon the iron bars the bolted doors and the shadow which moved behind the other grating ah said andrea deeply affected good morning benedetto said bertuccio with his deep hollow voice you you said the young man looking fearfully around him do you not recognize me unhappy child silence be silent said andrea who knew the delicate sense of hearing possessed by the walls for heavens sake do not speak so loud you wish to speak with me alone do you not said bertuccio oh yes that is well and bertuccio feeling in his pocket signed to a keeper whom he saw through the window of the wicket read he said what is that asked andrea an order to conduct you to a room and to leave you there to talk to me oh cried andrea leaping with joy then he mentally added still my unknown protector i am not forgotten they wish for secrecy since we are to converse in a private room i understand bertuccio has been sent by my protector the keeper spoke for a moment with an official then opened the iron gates and
