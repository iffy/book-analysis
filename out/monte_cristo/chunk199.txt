who owned a small flock and lived by the wool and the milk which he sold at rome when quite a child the little vampa displayed a most extraordinary precocity one day when he was seven years old he came to the curate of palestrina and asked to be taught to read it was somewhat difficult for he could not quit his flock but the good curate went every day to say mass at a little hamlet too poor to pay a priest and which having no other name was called borgo he told luigi that he might meet him on his return and that then he would give him a lesson warning him that it would be short and that he must profit as much as possible by it the child accepted joyfully every day luigi led his flock to graze on the road that leads from palestrina to borgo every day at nine oclock in the morning the priest and the boy sat down on a bank by the wayside and the little shepherd took his lesson out of the priests breviary at the end of three months he had learned to read this was not enough he must now learn to write the priest had a writing teacher at rome make three alphabets one large one middling and one small and pointed out to him that by the help of a sharp instrument he could trace the letters on a slate and thus learn to write the same evening when the flock was safe at the farm the little luigi hastened to the smith at palestrina took a large nail heated and sharpened it and formed a sort of stylus the next morning he gathered an armful of pieces of slate and began at the end of three months he had learned to write the curate astonished at his quickness and intelligence made him a present of pens paper and a penknife this demanded new effort but nothing compared to the first at the end of a week he wrote as well with this pen as with the stylus the curate related the incident to the count of san-felice who sent for the little shepherd made him read and write before him ordered his attendant to let him eat with the domestics and to give him two piastres a month with this luigi purchased books and pencils he applied his imitative powers to everything and like giotto when young he drew on his slate sheep houses and trees then with his knife he began to carve all sorts of objects in wood it was thus that pinelli the famous sculptor had commenced m a girl of six or seven that is a little younger than vampa tended sheep on a farm near palestrina she was an orphan born at valmontone and was named teresa the two children met sat down near each other let their flocks mingle together played laughed and conversed together in the evening they separated the count of san-felices flock from those of baron cervetri and the children returned to their respective farms promising to meet the next morning the next day they kept their word and thus they grew up together vampa was twelve and teresa eleven and yet their natural disposition revealed itself beside his taste for the fine arts which luigi had carried as far as he could in his solitude he was given to alternating fits of sadness and enthusiasm was often angry and capricious and always sarcastic none of the lads of pampinara palestrina or valmontone had been able to gain any influence over him or even to become his companion his disposition always inclined to exact concessions rather than to make them kept
