the food i had not tasted for three days if anyone had said to either of us then live the day will come when you will be happy and will bless life no matter whose voice had spoken we should have heard him with the smile of doubt or the anguish of incredulity and yet how many times has your father blessed life while embracing you how often have i myself ah exclaimed morrel interrupting the count you had only lost your liberty my father had only lost his fortune but i have lost valentine look at me said monte cristo with that expression which sometimes made him so eloquent and persuasive look at me there are no tears in my eyes nor is there fever in my veins yet i see you suffer you maximilian whom i love as my own son well does not this tell you that in grief as in life there is always something to look forward to beyond now if i entreat if i order you to live morrel it is in the conviction that one day you will thank me for having preserved your life oh heavens said the young man oh heavens what are you saying count take care but perhaps you have never loved child replied the count i mean as i love you see i have been a soldier ever since i attained manhood i reached the age of twenty-nine without loving for none of the feelings i before then experienced merit the appellation of love well at twenty-nine i saw valentine for two years i have loved her for two years i have seen written in her heart as in a book all the virtues of a daughter and wife count to possess valentine would have been a happiness too infinite too ecstatic too complete too divine for this world since it has been denied me but without valentine the earth is desolate i have told you to hope said the count then have a care i repeat for you seek to persuade me and if you succeed i should lose my reason for i should hope that i could again behold valentine the count smiled my friend my father said morrel with excitement have a care i again repeat for the power you wield over me alarms me weigh your words before you speak for my eyes have already become brighter and my heart beats strongly be cautious or you will make me believe in supernatural agencies i must obey you though you bade me call forth the dead or walk upon the water hope my friend repeated the count ah said morrel falling from the height of excitement to the abyss of despair ah you are playing with me like those good or rather selfish mothers who soothe their children with honeyed words because their screams annoy them no my friend i was wrong to caution you do not fear i will bury my grief so deep in my heart i will disguise it so that you shall not even care to sympathize with me adieu my friend adieu on the contrary said the count after this time you must live with me you must not leave me and in a week we shall have left france behind us and you still bid me hope i tell you to hope because i have a method of curing you count you render me sadder than before if it be possible you think the result of this blow has been to produce an ordinary grief and you would cure it by an ordinary remedy change of scene and morrel dropped his head with disdainful incredulity what can i say more asked monte cristo
