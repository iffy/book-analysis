you will but tonight you neither can nor shall for that purpose i mean to keep you all to myself franz protested he could not defer his pursuit till the following day for many reasons listen to me said the countess and do not be so very headstrong i am going home i have a party at my house tonight and therefore cannot possibly remain till the end of the opera now i cannot for one instant believe you so devoid of gallantry as to refuse a lady your escort when she even condescends to ask you for it there was nothing else left for franz to do but to take up his hat open the door of the box and offer the countess his arm it was quite evident by her manner that her uneasiness was not feigned and franz himself could not resist a feeling of superstitious dread so much the stronger in him as it arose from a variety of corroborative recollections while the terror of the countess sprang from an instinctive belief originally created in her mind by the wild tales she had listened to till she believed them truths franz could even feel her arm tremble as he assisted her into the carriage upon arriving at her hotel franz perceived that she had deceived him when she spoke of expecting company on the contrary her own return before the appointed hour seemed greatly to astonish the servants excuse my little subterfuge said the countess in reply to her companions half-reproachful observation on the subject but that horrid man had made me feel quite uncomfortable and i longed to be alone that i might compose my startled mind franz essayed to smile nay said she do not smile it ill accords with the expression of your countenance and i am sure it does not spring from your heart however promise me one thing what is it promise me i say i will do anything you desire except relinquish my determination of finding out who this man is i have more reasons than you can imagine for desiring to know who he is from whence he came and whither he is going where he comes from i am ignorant but i can readily tell you where he is going to and that is down below without the least doubt let us only speak of the promise you wished me to make said franz well then you must give me your word to return immediately to your hotel and make no attempt to follow this man tonight there are certain affinities between the persons we quit and those we meet afterwards for heavens sake do not serve as a conductor between that man and me pursue your chase after him tomorrow as eagerly as you please but never bring him near me if you would not see me die of terror and now good-night go to your rooms and try to sleep away all recollections of this evening for my own part i am quite sure i shall not be able to close my eyes so saying the countess quitted franz leaving him unable to decide whether she were merely amusing herself at his expense or whether her fears and agitations were genuine upon his return to the hotel franz found albert in his dressing-gown and slippers listlessly extended on a sofa smoking a cigar my dear fellow cried he springing up is it really you why i did not expect to see you before tomorrow my dear albert replied franz i am glad of this opportunity to tell you once and forever that you entertain a most erroneous notion concerning italian women i should have thought the continual failures you have met
