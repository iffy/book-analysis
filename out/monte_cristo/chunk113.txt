himself time to reconsider his decision and indeed that he might not allow his thoughts to be distracted from his desperate resolution he bent over the appalling shroud opened it with the knife which faria had made drew the corpse from the sack and bore it along the tunnel to his own chamber laid it on his couch tied around its head the rag he wore at night around his own covered it with his counterpane once again kissed the ice-cold brow and tried vainly to close the resisting eyes which glared horribly turned the head towards the wall so that the jailer might when he brought the evening meal believe that he was asleep as was his frequent custom entered the tunnel again drew the bed against the wall returned to the other cell took from the hiding-place the needle and thread flung off his rags that they might feel only naked flesh beneath the coarse canvas and getting inside the sack placed himself in the posture in which the dead body had been laid and sewed up the mouth of the sack from the inside he would have been discovered by the beating of his heart if by any mischance the jailers had entered at that moment dants might have waited until the evening visit was over but he was afraid that the governor would change his mind and order the dead body to be removed earlier in that case his last hope would have been destroyed now his plans were fully made and this is what he intended to do if while he was being carried out the grave-diggers should discover that they were bearing a live instead of a dead body dants did not intend to give them time to recognize him but with a sudden cut of the knife he meant to open the sack from top to bottom and profiting by their alarm escape if they tried to catch him he would use his knife to better purpose m if they took him to the cemetery and laid him in a grave he would allow himself to be covered with earth and then as it was night the grave-diggers could scarcely have turned their backs before he would have worked his way through the yielding soil and escaped he hoped that the weight of earth would not be so great that he could not overcome it if he was detected in this and the earth proved too heavy he would be stifled and then so much the better all would be over dants had not eaten since the preceding evening but he had not thought of hunger nor did he think of it now his situation was too precarious to allow him even time to reflect on any thought but one the first risk that dants ran was that the jailer when he brought him his supper at seven oclock might perceive the change that had been made fortunately twenty times at least from misanthropy or fatigue dants had received his jailer in bed and then the man placed his bread and soup on the table and went away without saying a word this time the jailer might not be as silent as usual but speak to dants and seeing that he received no reply go to the bed and thus discover all when seven oclock came dants agony really began his hand placed upon his heart was unable to redress its throbbings while with the other he wiped the perspiration from his temples from time to time chills ran through his whole body and clutched his heart in a grasp of ice then he thought he was going to die yet the hours passed on without any unusual
