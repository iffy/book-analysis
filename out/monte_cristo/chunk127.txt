and beyond the flat but verdant island of la pianosa the peak of monte cristo reddened by the burning sun was seen against the azure sky dants ordered the helmsman to put down his helm in order to leave la pianosa to starboard as he knew that he should shorten his course by two or three knots about five oclock in the evening the island was distinct and everything on it was plainly perceptible owing to that clearness of the atmosphere peculiar to the light which the rays of the sun cast at its setting edmond gazed very earnestly at the mass of rocks which gave out all the variety of twilight colors from the brightest pink to the deepest blue and from time to time his cheeks flushed his brow darkened and a mist passed over his eyes never did a gamester whose whole fortune is staked on one cast of the die experience the anguish which edmond felt in his paroxysms of hope night came and at ten oclock they anchored la jeune amlie was first at the rendezvous in spite of his usual command over himself dants could not restrain his impetuosity he was the first to jump on shore and had he dared he would like lucius brutus have kissed his mother earth it was dark but at eleven oclock the moon rose in the midst of the ocean whose every wave she silvered and then ascending high played in floods of pale light on the rocky hills of this second pelion the island was familiar to the crew of la jeune amlie it was one of her regular haunts as to dants he had passed it on his voyage to and from the levant but never touched at it he questioned jacopo where shall we pass the night he inquired why on board the tartan replied the sailor should we not do better in the grottos what grottos why the grottos caves of the island i do not know of any grottos replied jacopo the cold sweat sprang forth on dants brow what are there no grottos at monte cristo he asked none for a moment dants was speechless then he remembered that these caves might have been filled up by some accident or even stopped up for the sake of greater security by cardinal spada the point was then to discover the hidden entrance it was useless to search at night and dants therefore delayed all investigation until the morning besides a signal made half a league out at sea and to which la jeune amlie replied by a similar signal indicated that the moment for business had come the boat that now arrived assured by the answering signal that all was well soon came in sight white and silent as a phantom and cast anchor within a cables length of shore then the landing began dants reflected as he worked on the shout of joy which with a single word he could evoke from all these men if he gave utterance to the one unchanging thought that pervaded his heart but far from disclosing this precious secret he almost feared that he had already said too much and by his restlessness and continual questions his minute observations and evident preoccupation aroused suspicions fortunately as regarded this circumstance at least his painful past gave to his countenance an indelible sadness and the glimmerings of gayety seen beneath this cloud were indeed but transitory no one had the slightest suspicion and when next day taking a fowling-piece powder and shot dants declared his intention to go and kill some of the wild goats that were seen springing from rock to rock his wish was construed into a love of sport
