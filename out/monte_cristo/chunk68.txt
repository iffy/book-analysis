murmured dants since my only protector is removed had m de villefort any cause of personal dislike to you none on the contrary he was very kind to me i can then rely on the notes he has left concerning you entirely that is well wait patiently then dants fell on his knees and prayed earnestly the door closed but this time a fresh inmate was left with dants hope m will you see the register at once asked the governor or proceed to the other cell let us visit them all said the inspector if i once went up those stairs i should never have the courage to come down again ah this one is not like the other and his madness is less affecting than this ones display of reason what is his folly he fancies he possesses an immense treasure the first year he offered government a million of francs for his release the second two the third three and so on progressively he is now in his fifth year of captivity he will ask to speak to you in private and offer you five millions how curious what is his name the abb faria no said the inspector it is here unlock the door antoine the turnkey obeyed and the inspector gazed curiously into the chamber of the mad abb as the prisoner was usually called in the centre of the cell in a circle traced with a fragment of plaster detached from the wall sat a man whose tattered garments scarcely covered him he was drawing in this circle geometrical lines and seemed as much absorbed in his problem as archimedes was when the soldier of marcellus slew him he did not move at the sound of the door and continued his calculations until the flash of the torches lighted up with an unwonted glare the sombre walls of his cell then raising his head he perceived with astonishment the number of persons present he hastily seized the coverlet of his bed and wrapped it round him what is it you want said the inspector i monsieur replied the abb with an air of surprise i want nothing you do not understand continued the inspector i am sent here by government to visit the prison and hear the requests of the prisoners oh that is different cried the abb and we shall understand each other i hope there now whispered the governor it is just as i told you monsieur continued the prisoner i am the abb faria born at rome i was for twenty years cardinal spadas secretary i was arrested why i know not toward the beginning of the year since then i have demanded my liberty from the italian and french government why from the french government because i was arrested at piombino and i presume that like milan and florence piombino has become the capital of some french department ah said the inspector you have not the latest news from italy my information dates from the day on which i was arrested returned the abb faria and as the emperor had created the kingdom of rome for his infant son i presume that he has realized the dream of machiavelli and csar borgia which was to make italy a united kingdom monsieur returned the inspector providence has changed this gigantic plan you advocate so warmly it is the only means of rendering italy strong happy and independent very possibly only i am not come to discuss politics but to inquire if you have anything to ask or to complain of the food is the same as in other prisons that is very bad the lodging is very unhealthful but on the whole passable for a dungeon
