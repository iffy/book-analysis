that so important an event as the signature of a marriage-contract was going on morrel looked at his watch which wanted a quarter to ten but soon the same clock he had already heard strike two or three times rectified the error by striking half-past nine this was already half an hour past the time valentine had fixed it was a terrible moment for the young man the slightest rustling of the foliage the least whistling of the wind attracted his attention and drew the perspiration to his brow then he tremblingly fixed his ladder and not to lose a moment placed his foot on the first step amidst all these alternations of hope and fear the clock struck ten it is impossible said maximilian that the signing of a contract should occupy so long a time without unexpected interruptions i have weighed all the chances calculated the time required for all the forms something must have happened and then he walked rapidly to and fro and pressed his burning forehead against the fence had valentine fainted or had she been discovered and stopped in her flight these were the only obstacles which appeared possible to the young man the idea that her strength had failed her in attempting to escape and that she had fainted in one of the paths was the one that most impressed itself upon his mind in that case said he i should lose her and by my own fault he dwelt on this idea for a moment then it appeared reality he even thought he could perceive something on the ground at a distance he ventured to call and it seemed to him that the wind wafted back an almost inarticulate sigh at last the half-hour struck it was impossible to wait longer his temples throbbed violently his eyes were growing dim he passed one leg over the wall and in a moment leaped down on the other side he was on villeforts premises had arrived there by scaling the wall what might be the consequences however he had not ventured thus far to draw back he followed a short distance close under the wall then crossed a path hid entered a clump of trees in a moment he had passed through them and could see the house distinctly m then morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was not illuminated instead of lights at every window as is customary on days of ceremony he saw only a gray mass which was veiled also by a cloud which at that moment obscured the moons feeble light a light moved rapidly from time to time past three windows of the second floor these three windows were in madame de saint-mrans room another remained motionless behind some red curtains which were in madame de villeforts bedroom morrel guessed all this so many times in order to follow valentine in thought at every hour in the day had he made her describe the whole house that without having seen it he knew it all this darkness and silence alarmed morrel still more than valentines absence had done almost mad with grief and determined to venture everything in order to see valentine once more and be certain of the misfortune he feared morrel gained the edge of the clump of trees and was going to pass as quickly as possible through the flower-garden when the sound of a voice still at some distance but which was borne upon the wind reached him at this sound as he was already partially exposed to view he stepped back and concealed himself completely remaining perfectly motionless he had formed his resolution if it was valentine alone he would speak as she
