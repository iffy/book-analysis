a vow at a time when i little thought i should ever be able to accomplish it said the unknown with a singular smile and i made some others also which i hope i may fulfil in due season although sinbad pronounced these words with much calmness his eyes gave forth gleams of extraordinary ferocity you have suffered a great deal sir said franz inquiringly sinbad started and looked fixedly at him as he replied what makes you suppose so everything answered franz your voice your look your pallid complexion and even the life you lead i i live the happiest life possible the real life of a pasha i am king of all creation i am pleased with one place and stay there i get tired of it and leave it i am free as a bird and have wings like one my attendants obey my slightest wish sometimes i amuse myself by delivering some bandit or criminal from the bonds of the law then i have my mode of dispensing justice silent and sure without respite or appeal which condemns or pardons and which no one sees ah if you had tasted my life you would not desire any other and would never return to the world unless you had some great project to accomplish there revenge for instance observed franz the unknown fixed on the young man one of those looks which penetrate into the depth of the heart and thoughts and why revenge he asked because replied franz you seem to me like a man who persecuted by society has a fearful account to settle with it ah responded sinbad laughing with his singular laugh which displayed his white and sharp teeth you have not guessed rightly such as you see me i am a sort of philosopher and one day perhaps i shall go to paris to rival monsieur appert and the man in the little blue cloak and will that be the first time you ever took that journey yes it will i must seem to you by no means curious but i assure you that it is not my fault i have delayed it so long it will happen one day or the other m and do you propose to make this journey very shortly i do not know it depends on circumstances which depend on certain arrangements i should like to be there at the time you come and i will endeavor to repay you as far as lies in my power for your liberal hospitality displayed to me at monte cristo i should avail myself of your offer with pleasure replied the host but unfortunately if i go there it will be in all probability incognito the supper appeared to have been supplied solely for franz for the unknown scarcely touched one or two dishes of the splendid banquet to which his guest did ample justice then ali brought on the dessert or rather took the baskets from the hands of the statues and placed them on the table between the two baskets he placed a small silver cup with a silver cover the care with which ali placed this cup on the table roused franzs curiosity he raised the cover and saw a kind of greenish paste something like preserved angelica but which was perfectly unknown to him he replaced the lid as ignorant of what the cup contained as he was before he had looked at it and then casting his eyes towards his host he saw him smile at his disappointment you cannot guess said he what there is in that small vase can you no i really cannot well then that green preserve is nothing less than the ambrosia which hebe served
