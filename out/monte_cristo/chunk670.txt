pity were you not hateful in my eyes morrel yes you tell me to lay aside the mask and i will do so be satisfied when you spoke to me at the cemetery i answered you my heart was softened when you arrived here i allowed you to enter but since you abuse my confidence since you have devised a new torture after i thought i had exhausted them all then count of monte cristo my pretended benefactor then count of monte cristo the universal guardian be satisfied you shall witness the death of your friend and morrel with a maniacal laugh again rushed towards the pistols and i again repeat you shall not commit suicide prevent me then replied morrel with another struggle which like the first failed in releasing him from the counts iron grasp i will prevent you m and who are you then that arrogate to yourself this tyrannical right over free and rational beings who am i repeated monte cristo listen i am the only man in the world having the right to say to you morrel your fathers son shall not die today and monte cristo with an expression of majesty and sublimity advanced with arms folded toward the young man who involuntarily overcome by the commanding manner of this man recoiled a step why do you mention my father stammered he why do you mingle a recollection of him with the affairs of today because i am he who saved your fathers life when he wished to destroy himself as you do today because i am the man who sent the purse to your young sister and the pharaon to old morrel because i am the edmond dants who nursed you a child on my knees morrel made another step back staggering breathless crushed then all his strength give way and he fell prostrate at the feet of monte cristo then his admirable nature underwent a complete and sudden revulsion he arose rushed out of the room and to the stairs exclaiming energetically julie julie emmanuel emmanuel monte cristo endeavored also to leave but maximilian would have died rather than relax his hold of the handle of the door which he closed upon the count julie emmanuel and some of the servants ran up in alarm on hearing the cries of maximilian morrel seized their hands and opening the door exclaimed in a voice choked with sobs on your knees on your knees he is our benefactor the saviour of our father he is he would have added edmond dants but the count seized his arm and prevented him julie threw herself into the arms of the count emmanuel embraced him as a guardian angel morrel again fell on his knees and struck the ground with his forehead then the iron-hearted man felt his heart swell in his breast a flame seemed to rush from his throat to his eyes he bent his head and wept for a while nothing was heard in the room but a succession of sobs while the incense from their grateful hearts mounted to heaven julie had scarcely recovered from her deep emotion when she rushed out of the room descended to the next floor ran into the drawing-room with childlike joy and raised the crystal globe which covered the purse given by the unknown of the alles de meilhan meanwhile emmanuel in a broken voice said to the count oh count how could you hearing us so often speak of our unknown benefactor seeing us pay such homage of gratitude and adoration to his memory how could you continue so long without discovering yourself to us oh it was cruel to us and dare i say it to you also listen
