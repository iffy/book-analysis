inquired a turnkey why about ten or eleven oclock shall we watch by the corpse of what use would it be shut the dungeon as if he were alive that is all then the steps retreated and the voices died away in the distance the noise of the door with its creaking hinges and bolts ceased and a silence more sombre than that of solitude ensued the silence of death which was all-pervasive and struck its icy chill to the very soul of dants then he raised the flag-stone cautiously with his head and looked carefully around the chamber it was empty and dants emerged from the tunnel chapter the cemetery of the chteau dif on the bed at full length and faintly illuminated by the pale light that came from the window lay a sack of canvas and under its rude folds was stretched a long and stiffened form it was farias last winding-sheet a winding-sheet which as the turnkey said cost so little everything was in readiness a barrier had been placed between dants and his old friend no longer could edmond look into those wide-open eyes which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of death no longer could he clasp the hand which had done so much to make his existence blessed faria the beneficent and cheerful companion with whom he was accustomed to live so intimately no longer breathed he seated himself on the edge of that terrible bed and fell into melancholy and gloomy reverie alone he was alone again again condemned to silence again face to face with nothingness alone never again to see the face never again to hear the voice of the only human being who united him to earth was not farias fate the better after all to solve the problem of life at its source even at the risk of horrible suffering the idea of suicide which his friend had driven away and kept away by his cheerful presence now hovered like a phantom over the abbs dead body if i could die he said i should go where he goes and should assuredly find him again but how to die it is very easy he went on with a smile i will remain here rush on the first person that opens the door strangle him and then they will guillotine me but excessive grief is like a storm at sea where the frail bark is tossed from the depths to the top of the wave dants recoiled from the idea of so infamous a death and passed suddenly from despair to an ardent desire for life and liberty die oh no he exclaimed not die now after having lived and suffered so long and so much die yes had i died years ago but now to die would be indeed to give way to the sarcasm of destiny no i want to live i shall struggle to the very last i will yet win back the happiness of which i have been deprived before i die i must not forget that i have my executioners to punish and perhaps too who knows some friends to reward yet they will forget me here and i shall die in my dungeon like faria as he said this he became silent and gazed straight before him like one overwhelmed with a strange and amazing thought suddenly he arose lifted his hand to his brow as if his brain were giddy paced twice or thrice round the dungeon and then paused abruptly by the bed just god he muttered whence comes this thought is it from thee since none but the dead pass freely from this dungeon let me take the place of the dead without giving
