the holy father looked for in the first place he could sell the great appointments and splendid offices which the cardinals already held and then he had the two hats to sell besides there was a third point in view which will appear hereafter the pope and csar borgia first found the two future cardinals they were giovanni rospigliosi who held four of the highest dignities of the holy see and csar spada one of the noblest and richest of the roman nobility both felt the high honor of such a favor from the pope they were ambitious and csar borgia soon found purchasers for their appointments the result was that rospigliosi and spada paid for being cardinals and eight other persons paid for the offices the cardinals held before their elevation and thus eight hundred thousand crowns entered into the coffers of the speculators m it is time now to proceed to the last part of the speculation the pope heaped attentions upon rospigliosi and spada conferred upon them the insignia of the cardinalate and induced them to arrange their affairs and take up their residence at rome then the pope and csar borgia invited the two cardinals to dinner this was a matter of dispute between the holy father and his son csar thought they could make use of one of the means which he always had ready for his friends that is to say in the first place the famous key which was given to certain persons with the request that they go and open a designated cupboard this key was furnished with a small iron point a negligence on the part of the locksmith when this was pressed to effect the opening of the cupboard of which the lock was difficult the person was pricked by this small point and died next day then there was the ring with the lions head which csar wore when he wanted to greet his friends with a clasp of the hand the lion bit the hand thus favored and at the end of twenty-four hours the bite was mortal csar proposed to his father that they should either ask the cardinals to open the cupboard or shake hands with them but alexander vi replied now as to the worthy cardinals spada and rospigliosi let us ask both of them to dinner something tells me that we shall get that money back besides you forget csar an indigestion declares itself immediately while a prick or a bite occasions a delay of a day or two csar gave way before such cogent reasoning and the cardinals were consequently invited to dinner the table was laid in a vineyard belonging to the pope near san pierdarena a charming retreat which the cardinals knew very well by report rospigliosi quite set up with his new dignities went with a good appetite and his most ingratiating manner spada a prudent man and greatly attached to his only nephew a young captain of the highest promise took paper and pen and made his will he then sent word to his nephew to wait for him near the vineyard but it appeared the servant did not find him spada knew what these invitations meant since christianity so eminently civilizing had made progress in rome it was no longer a centurion who came from the tyrant with a message csar wills that you die but it was a legate latere who came with a smile on his lips to say from the pope his holiness requests you to dine with him spada set out about two oclock to san pierdarena the pope awaited him the first sight that attracted the eyes of spada was that of his nephew in full costume and
