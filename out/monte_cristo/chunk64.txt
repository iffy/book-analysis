it is sometimes essential to government to cause a mans disappearance without leaving any traces so that no written forms or documents may defeat their wishes it might be so under the bourbons but at present it has always been so my dear morrel since the reign of louis xiv the emperor is more strict in prison discipline than even louis himself and the number of prisoners whose names are not on the register is incalculable had morrel even any suspicions so much kindness would have dispelled them well m de villefort how would you advise me to act asked he petition the minister oh i know what that is the minister receives two hundred petitions every day and does not read three that is true but he will read a petition countersigned and presented by me and will you undertake to deliver it with the greatest pleasure dants was then guilty and now he is innocent and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn him villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry which however improbable it might be if it did take place would leave him defenceless but how shall i address the minister sit down there said villefort giving up his place to morrel and write what i dictate will you be so good certainly but lose no time we have lost too much already that is true only think what the poor fellow may even now be suffering villefort shuddered at the suggestion but he had gone too far to draw back dants must be crushed to gratify villeforts ambition villefort dictated a petition in which from an excellent intention no doubt dants patriotic services were exaggerated and he was made out one of the most active agents of napoleons return it was evident that at the sight of this document the minister would instantly release him the petition finished villefort read it aloud that will do said he leave the rest to me will the petition go soon today countersigned by you the best thing i can do will be to certify the truth of the contents of your petition and sitting down villefort wrote the certificate at the bottom what more is to be done i will do whatever is necessary this assurance delighted morrel who took leave of villefort and hastened to announce to old dants that he would soon see his son as for villefort instead of sending to paris he carefully preserved the petition that so fearfully compromised dants in the hopes of an event that seemed not unlikely that is a second restoration dants remained a prisoner and heard not the noise of the fall of louis xviiis throne or the still more tragic destruction of the empire twice during the hundred days had morrel renewed his demand and twice had villefort soothed him with promises at last there was waterloo and morrel came no more he had done all that was in his power and any fresh attempt would only compromise himself uselessly louis xviii remounted the throne villefort to whom marseilles had become filled with remorseful memories sought and obtained the situation of kings procureur at toulouse and a fortnight afterwards he married mademoiselle de saint-mran whose father now stood higher at court than ever and so dants after the hundred days and after waterloo remained in his dungeon forgotten of earth and heaven danglars comprehended the full extent of the wretched fate that overwhelmed dants and when napoleon returned to france he after the manner of mediocre minds termed the coincidence a decree of providence but when napoleon returned to paris danglars heart failed him and he lived in constant fear of dants return on
