travelling friend do we cried the countess extending her hand to him with all the warmth and cordiality of an old acquaintance it was really very good of you to recognize me so quickly and still more so to bestow your first visit on me be assured replied albert that if i had been aware of your arrival in paris and had known your address i should have paid my respects to you before this allow me to introduce my friend baron de chteau-renaud one of the few true gentlemen now to be found in france and from whom i have just learned that you were a spectator of the races in the champ-de-mars yesterday chteau-renaud bowed to the countess so you were at the races baron inquired the countess eagerly yes madame well then pursued madame g with considerable animation you can probably tell me who won the jockey club stakes i am sorry to say i cannot replied the baron and i was just asking the same question of albert are you very anxious to know countess asked albert to know what the name of the owner of the winning horse excessively only imagine but do tell me viscount whether you really are acquainted with it or no i beg your pardon madame but you were about to relate some story were you not you said only imagine and then paused pray continue well then listen you must know i felt so interested in the splendid roan horse with his elegant little rider so tastefully dressed in a pink satin jacket and cap that i could not help praying for their success with as much earnestness as though the half of my fortune were at stake and when i saw them outstrip all the others and come to the winning-post in such gallant style i actually clapped my hands with joy imagine my surprise when upon returning home the first object i met on the staircase was the identical jockey in the pink jacket i concluded that by some singular chance the owner of the winning horse must live in the same hotel as myself but as i entered my apartments i beheld the very gold cup awarded as a prize to the unknown horse and rider inside the cup was a small piece of paper on which were written these words from lord ruthven to countess g precisely i was sure of it said morcerf sure of what that the owner of the horse was lord ruthven himself what lord ruthven do you mean why our lord ruthven the vampire of the salle argentina is it possible exclaimed the countess is he here in paris to be sure why not and you visit him meet him at your own house and elsewhere i assure you he is my most intimate friend and m de chteau-renaud has also the honor of his acquaintance but why are you so sure of his being the winner of the jockey club prize was not the winning horse entered by the name of vampa what of that why do you not recollect the name of the celebrated bandit by whom i was made prisoner oh yes and from whose hands the count extricated me in so wonderful a manner to be sure i remember it all now he called himself vampa you see its evident where the count got the name but what could have been his motive for sending the cup to me in the first place because i had spoken much of you to him as you may believe and in the second because he delighted to see a countrywoman take so lively an interest in his success i trust and hope you never repeated
