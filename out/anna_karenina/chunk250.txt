and socially delightful life the old man who had been sitting beside him had long ago gone home the people had all separated those who lived near had gone home while those who came from far were gathered into a group for supper and to spend the night in the meadow levin unobserved by the peasants still lay on the haycock and still looked on and listened and mused the peasants who remained for the night in the meadow scarcely slept all the short summer night at first there was the sound of merry talk and laughing all together over the supper then singing again and laughter all the long day of toil had left no trace in them but lightness of heart before the early dawn all was hushed nothing was to be heard but the night sounds of the frogs that never ceased in the marsh and the horses snorting in the mist that rose over the meadow before the morning rousing himself levin got up from the haycock and looking at the stars he saw that the night was over well what am i going to do how am i to set about it he said to himself trying to express to himself all the thoughts and feelings he had passed through in that brief night all the thoughts and feelings he had passed through fell into three separate trains of thought one was the renunciation of his old life of his utterly useless education this renunciation gave him satisfaction and was easy and simple another series of thoughts and mental images related to the life he longed to live now the simplicity the purity the sanity of this life he felt clearly and he was convinced he would find in it the content the peace and the dignity of the lack of which he was so miserably conscious but a third series of ideas turned upon the question how to effect this transition from the old life to the new and there nothing took clear shape for him have a wife have work and the necessity of work leave pokrovskoe buy land become a member of a peasant community marry a peasant girl how am i to set about it he asked himself again and could not find an answer i havent slept all night though and i cant think it out clearly he said to himself ill work it out later one things certain this night has decided my fate all my old dreams of home life were absurd not the real thing he told himself its all ever so much simpler and better how beautiful he thought looking at the strange as it were mother-of-pearl shell of white fleecy cloudlets resting right over his head in the middle of the sky how exquisite it all is in this
