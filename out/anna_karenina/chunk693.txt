latch a grotesque-looking lady wearing a bustle anna mentally undressed the woman and was appalled at her hideousness and a little girl laughing affectedly ran down the platform katerina andreevna shes got them all ma tante cried the girl even the childs hideous and affected thought anna to avoid seeing anyone she got up quickly and seated herself at the opposite window of the empty carriage a misshapen-looking peasant covered with dirt in a cap from which his tangled hair stuck out all round passed by that window stooping down to the carriage wheels theres something familiar about that hideous peasant thought anna and remembering her dream she moved away to the opposite door shaking with terror the conductor opened the door and let in a man and his wife do you wish to get out anna made no answer the conductor and her two fellow-passengers did not notice under her veil her panic-stricken face she went back to her corner and sat down the couple seated themselves on the opposite side and intently but surreptitiously scrutinized her clothes both husband and wife seemed repulsive to anna the husband asked would she allow him to smoke obviously not with a view to smoking but to getting into conversation with her receiving her assent he said to his wife in french something about caring less to smoke than to talk they made inane and affected remarks to one another entirely for her benefit anna saw clearly that they were sick of each other and hated each other and no one could have helped hating such miserable monstrosities a second bell sounded and was followed by moving of luggage noise shouting and laughter it was so clear to anna that there was nothing for anyone to be glad of that this laughter irritated her agonizingly and she would have liked to stop up her ears not to hear it at last the third bell rang there was a whistle and a hiss of steam and a clank of chains and the man in her carriage crossed himself it would be interesting to ask him what meaning he attaches to that thought anna looking angrily at him she looked past the lady out of the window at the people who seemed whirling by as they ran beside the train or stood on the platform the train jerking at regular intervals at the junctions of the rails rolled by the platform past a stone wall a signal-box past other trains the wheels moving more smoothly and evenly resounded with a slight clang on the rails the window was lighted up by the bright evening sun and a slight breeze fluttered the curtain anna forgot her fellow passengers and to the light swaying of the train she fell to thinking again as she breathed the fresh air yes
