was waked by a horrible nightmare which had recurred several times in her dreams even before her connection with vronsky a little old man with unkempt beard was doing something bent down over some iron muttering meaningless french words and she as she always did in this nightmare it was what made the horror of it felt that this peasant was taking no notice of her but was doing something horrible with the iron over her and she waked up in a cold sweat when she got up the previous day came back to her as though veiled in mist there was a quarrel just what has happened several times i said i had a headache and he did not come in to see me tomorrow were going away i must see him and get ready for the journey she said to herself and learning that he was in his study she went down to him as she passed through the drawing-room she heard a carriage stop at the entrance and looking out of the window she saw the carriage from which a young girl in a lilac hat was leaning out giving some direction to the footman ringing the bell after a parley in the hall someone came upstairs and vronskys steps could be heard passing the drawing-room he went rapidly downstairs anna went again to the window she saw him come out onto the steps without his hat and go up to the carriage the young girl in the lilac hat handed him a parcel vronsky smiling said something to her the carriage drove away he ran rapidly upstairs again the mists that had shrouded everything in her soul parted suddenly the feelings of yesterday pierced the sick heart with a fresh pang she could not understand now how she could have lowered herself by spending a whole day with him in his house she went into his room to announce her determination that was madame sorokina and her daughter they came and brought me the money and the deeds from maman i couldnt get them yesterday how is your head better he said quietly not wishing to see and to understand the gloomy and solemn expression of her face she looked silently intently at him standing in the middle of the room he glanced at her frowned for a moment and went on reading a letter she turned and went deliberately out of the room he still might have turned her back but she had reached the door he was still silent and the only sound audible was the rustling of the note paper as he turned it oh by the way he said at the very moment she was in the doorway were going tomorrow for certain arent we you but not i she said turning round to him
