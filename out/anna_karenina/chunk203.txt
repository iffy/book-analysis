for practicing her new principles in imitation of varenka at first the princess noticed nothing but that kitty was much under the influence of her engouement as she called it for madame stahl and still more for varenka she saw that kitty did not merely imitate varenka in her conduct but unconsciously imitated her in her manner of walking of talking of blinking her eyes but later on the princess noticed that apart from this adoration some kind of serious spiritual change was taking place in her daughter the princess saw that in the evenings kitty read a french testament that madame stahl had given her a thing she had never done before that she avoided society acquaintances and associated with the sick people who were under varenkas protection and especially one poor family that of a sick painter petrov kitty was unmistakably proud of playing the part of a sister of mercy in that family all this was well enough and the princess had nothing to say against it especially as petrovs wife was a perfectly nice sort of woman and that the german princess noticing kittys devotion praised her calling her an angel of consolation all this would have been very well if there had been no exaggeration but the princess saw that her daughter was rushing into extremes and so indeed she told her il ne faut jamais rien outrer she said to her her daughter made her no reply only in her heart she thought that one could not talk about exaggeration where christianity was concerned what exaggeration could there be in the practice of a doctrine wherein one was bidden to turn the other cheek when one was smitten and give ones cloak if ones coat were taken but the princess disliked this exaggeration and disliked even more the fact that she felt her daughter did not care to show her all her heart kitty did in fact conceal her new views and feelings from her mother she concealed them not because she did not respect or did not love her mother but simply because she was her mother she would have revealed them to anyone sooner than to her mother how is it anna pavlovnas not been to see us for so long the princess said one day of madame petrova ive asked her but she seems put out about something no ive not noticed it maman said kitty flushing hotly is it long since you went to see them were meaning to make an expedition to the mountains tomorrow answered kitty well you can go answered the princess gazing at her daughters embarrassed face and trying to guess the cause of her embarrassment that day varenka came to dinner and told them that anna pavlovna had changed her mind and given up the expedition for the morrow
