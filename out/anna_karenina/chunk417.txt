gave her his arm and with a new strange sense of closeness walked out of the church he did not believe he could not believe that it was true it was only when their wondering and timid eyes met that he believed in it because he felt that they were one after supper the same night the young people left for the country chapter vronsky and anna had been traveling for three months together in europe they had visited venice rome and naples and had just arrived at a small italian town where they meant to stay some time a handsome head waiter with thick pomaded hair parted from the neck upwards an evening coat a broad white cambric shirt front and a bunch of trinkets hanging above his rounded stomach stood with his hands in the full curve of his pockets looking contemptuously from under his eyelids while he gave some frigid reply to a gentleman who had stopped him catching the sound of footsteps coming from the other side of the entry towards the staircase the head waiter turned round and seeing the russian count who had taken their best rooms he took his hands out of his pockets deferentially and with a bow informed him that a courier had been and that the business about the palazzo had been arranged the steward was prepared to sign the agreement ah im glad to hear it said vronsky is madame at home or not madame has been out for a walk but has returned now answered the waiter vronsky took off his soft wide-brimmed hat and passed his handkerchief over his heated brow and hair which had grown half over his ears and was brushed back covering the bald patch on his head and glancing casually at the gentleman who still stood there gazing intently at him he would have gone on this gentleman is a russian and was inquiring after you said the head waiter with mingled feelings of annoyance at never being able to get away from acquaintances anywhere and longing to find some sort of diversion from the monotony of his life vronsky looked once more at the gentleman who had retreated and stood still again and at the same moment a light came into the eyes of both golenishtchev vronsky it really was golenishtchev a comrade of vronskys in the corps of pages in the corps golenishtchev had belonged to the liberal party he left the corps without entering the army and had never taken office under the government vronsky and he had gone completely different ways on leaving the corps and had only met once since at that meeting vronsky perceived that golenishtchev had taken up a sort of lofty intellectually liberal line and was consequently disposed to look down upon vronskys interests and calling in life
