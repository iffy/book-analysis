feeling with his system of managing his land was not an exceptional case but the general condition of things in russia that the organization of some relation of the laborers to the soil in which they would work as with the peasant he had met half-way to the sviazhskys was not a dream but a problem which must be solved and it seemed to him that the problem could be solved and that he ought to try and solve it after saying good-night to the ladies and promising to stay the whole of the next day so as to make an expedition on horseback with them to see an interesting ruin in the crown forest levin went before going to bed into his hosts study to get the books on the labor question that sviazhsky had offered him sviazhskys study was a huge room surrounded by bookcases and with two tables in it one a massive writing-table standing in the middle of the room and the other a round table covered with recent numbers of reviews and journals in different languages ranged like the rays of a star round the lamp on the writing-table was a stand of drawers marked with gold lettering and full of papers of various sorts sviazhsky took out the books and sat down in a rocking-chair what are you looking at there he said to levin who was standing at the round table looking through the reviews oh yes theres a very interesting article here said sviazhsky of the review levin was holding in his hand it appears he went on with eager interest that friedrich was not after all the person chiefly responsible for the partition of poland it is proved and with his characteristic clearness he summed up those new very important and interesting revelations although levin was engrossed at the moment by his ideas about the problem of the land he wondered as he heard sviazhsky what is there inside of him and why why is he interested in the partition of poland when sviazhsky had finished levin could not help asking well and what then but there was nothing to follow it was simply interesting that it had been proved to be so and so but sviazhsky did not explain and saw no need to explain why it was interesting to him yes but i was very much interested by your irritable neighbor said levin sighing hes a clever fellow and said a lot that was true oh get along with you an inveterate supporter of serfdom at heart like all of them said sviazhsky whose marshal you are yes only i marshal them in the other direction said sviazhsky laughing ill tell you what interests me very much said levin hes right that our system thats to say of rational farming doesnt answer
