letting himself go into the snare of words the philosophers set for him he seemed to comprehend something but he had only to forget the artificial train of reasoning and to turn from life itself to what had satisfied him while thinking in accordance with the fixed definitions and all this artificial edifice fell to pieces at once like a house of cards and it became clear that the edifice had been built up out of those transposed words apart from anything in life more important than reason at one time reading schopenhauer he put in place of his will the word love and for a couple of days this new philosophy charmed him till he removed a little away from it but then when he turned from life itself to glance at it again it fell away too and proved to be the same muslin garment with no warmth in it his brother sergey ivanovitch advised him to read the theological works of homiakov levin read the second volume of homiakovs works and in spite of the elegant epigrammatic argumentative style which at first repelled him he was impressed by the doctrine of the church he found in them he was struck at first by the idea that the apprehension of divine truths had not been vouchsafed to man but to a corporation of men bound together by love to the church what delighted him was the thought how much easier it was to believe in a still existing living church embracing all the beliefs of men and having god at its head and therefore holy and infallible and from it to accept the faith in god in the creation the fall the redemption than to begin with god a mysterious far-away god the creation etc but afterwards on reading a catholic writers history of the church and then a greek orthodox writers history of the church and seeing that the two churches in their very conception infallible each deny the authority of the other homiakovs doctrine of the church lost all its charm for him and this edifice crumbled into dust like the philosophers edifices all that spring he was not himself and went through fearful moments of horror without knowing what i am and why i am here lifes impossible and that i cant know and so i cant live levin said to himself in infinite time in infinite matter in infinite space is formed a bubble-organism and that bubble lasts a while and bursts and that bubble is me it was an agonizing error but it was the sole logical result of ages of human thought in that direction this was the ultimate belief on which all the systems elaborated by human thought in almost all their ramifications rested it was the prevalent conviction and of all other explanations
