there is no denying that the opposite camp has strong points in its favor you are for classics sergey ivanovitch will you take red wine said stepan arkadyevitch i am not expressing my own opinion of either form of culture sergey ivanovitch said holding out his glass with a smile of condescension as to a child i only say that both sides have strong arguments to support them he went on addressing alexey alexandrovitch my sympathies are classical from education but in this discussion i am personally unable to arrive at a conclusion i see no distinct grounds for classical studies being given a preeminence over scientific studies the natural sciences have just as great an educational value put in pestsov take astronomy take botany or zoology with its system of general principles i cannot quite agree with that responded alexey alexandrovitch it seems to me that one must admit that the very process of studying the forms of language has a peculiarly favorable influence on intellectual development moreover it cannot be denied that the influence of the classical authors is in the highest degree moral while unfortunately with the study of the natural sciences are associated the false and noxious doctrines which are the curse of our day sergey ivanovitch would have said something but pestsov interrupted him in his rich bass he began warmly contesting the justice of this view sergey ivanovitch waited serenely to speak obviously with a convincing reply ready but said sergey ivanovitch smiling subtly and addressing karenin one must allow that to weigh all the advantages and disadvantages of classical and scientific studies is a difficult task and the question which form of education was to be preferred would not have been so quickly and conclusively decided if there had not been in favor of classical education as you expressed it just now its moral disons le mot anti-nihilist influence undoubtedly if it had not been for the distinctive property of anti-nihilistic influence on the side of classical studies we should have considered the subject more have weighed the arguments on both sides said sergey ivanovitch with a subtle smile we should have given elbow-room to both tendencies but now we know that these little pills of classical learning possess the medicinal property of anti-nihilism and we boldly prescribe them to our patients but what if they had no such medicinal property he wound up humorously at sergey ivanovitchs little pills everyone laughed turovtsin in especial roared loudly and jovially glad at last to have found something to laugh at all he ever looked for in listening to conversation stepan arkadyevitch had not made a mistake in inviting pestsov with pestsov intellectual conversation never flagged for an instant directly sergey ivanovitch had concluded the conversation with his jest pestsov promptly started a new one i cant agree
