many of his intimate chums were to be found at the extreme ends of the social ladder and would have been very much surprised to learn that they had through the medium of oblonsky something in common he was the familiar friend of everyone with whom he took a glass of champagne and he took a glass of champagne with everyone and when in consequence he met any of his disreputable chums as he used in joke to call many of his friends in the presence of his subordinates he well knew how with his characteristic tact to diminish the disagreeable impression made on them levin was not a disreputable chum but oblonsky with his ready tact felt that levin fancied he might not care to show his intimacy with him before his subordinates and so he made haste to take him off into his room levin was almost of the same age as oblonsky their intimacy did not rest merely on champagne levin had been the friend and companion of his early youth they were fond of one another in spite of the difference of their characters and tastes as friends are fond of one another who have been together in early youth but in spite of this each of them as is often the way with men who have selected careers of different kinds though in discussion he would even justify the others career in his heart despised it it seemed to each of them that the life he led himself was the only real life and the life led by his friend was a mere phantasm oblonsky could not restrain a slight mocking smile at the sight of levin how often he had seen him come up to moscow from the country where he was doing something but what precisely stepan arkadyevitch could never quite make out and indeed he took no interest in the matter levin arrived in moscow always excited and in a hurry rather ill at ease and irritated by his own want of ease and for the most part with a perfectly new unexpected view of things stepan arkadyevitch laughed at this and liked it in the same way levin in his heart despised the town mode of life of his friend and his official duties which he laughed at and regarded as trifling but the difference was that oblonsky as he was doing the same as everyone did laughed complacently and good-humoredly while levin laughed without complacency and sometimes angrily we have long been expecting you said stepan arkadyevitch going into his room and letting levins hand go as though to show that here all danger was over i am very very glad to see you he went on well how are you eh when did you come levin was silent looking at the unknown faces
