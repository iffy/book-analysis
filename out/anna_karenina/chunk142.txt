rood well mind you crumble up the clods said levin going towards his horse and keep an eye on mishka and if theres a good crop you shall have half a rouble for every acre humbly thankful we are very well content sir as it is levin got on his horse and rode towards the field where was last years clover and the one which was ploughed ready for the spring corn the crop of clover coming up in the stubble was magnificent it had survived everything and stood up vividly green through the broken stalks of last years wheat the horse sank in up to the pasterns and he drew each hoof with a sucking sound out of the half-thawed ground over the ploughland riding was utterly impossible the horse could only keep a foothold where there was ice and in the thawing furrows he sank deep in at each step the ploughland was in splendid condition in a couple of days it would be fit for harrowing and sowing everything was capital everything was cheering levin rode back across the streams hoping the water would have gone down and he did in fact get across and startled two ducks there must be snipe too he thought and just as he reached the turning homewards he met the forest keeper who confirmed his theory about the snipe levin went home at a trot so as to have time to eat his dinner and get his gun ready for the evening chapter as he rode up to the house in the happiest frame of mind levin heard the bell ring at the side of the principal entrance of the house yes thats someone from the railway station he thought just the time to be here from the moscow train who could it be what if its brother nikolay he did say maybe ill go to the waters or maybe ill come down to you he felt dismayed and vexed for the first minute that his brother nikolays presence should come to disturb his happy mood of spring but he felt ashamed of the feeling and at once he opened as it were the arms of his soul and with a softened feeling of joy and expectation now he hoped with all his heart that it was his brother he pricked up his horse and riding out from behind the acacias he saw a hired three-horse sledge from the railway station and a gentleman in a fur coat it was not his brother oh if it were only some nice person one could talk to a little he thought ah cried levin joyfully flinging up both his hands heres a delightful visitor ah how glad i am to see you he shouted recognizing stepan arkadyevitch i shall find out for certain whether shes married or
