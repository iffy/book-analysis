expecting an englishman who wanted to buy it oh thats only an old study he said how fine said golenishtchev he too with unmistakable sincerity falling under the spell of the picture two boys were angling in the shade of a willow-tree the elder had just dropped in the hook and was carefully pulling the float from behind a bush entirely absorbed in what he was doing the other a little younger was lying in the grass leaning on his elbows with his tangled flaxen head in his hands staring at the water with his dreamy blue eyes what was he thinking of the enthusiasm over this picture stirred some of the old feeling for it in mihailov but he feared and disliked this waste of feeling for things past and so even though this praise was grateful to him he tried to draw his visitors away to a third picture but vronsky asked whether the picture was for sale to mihailov at that moment excited by visitors it was extremely distasteful to speak of money matters it is put up there to be sold he answered scowling gloomily when the visitors had gone mihailov sat down opposite the picture of pilate and christ and in his mind went over what had been said and what though not said had been implied by those visitors and strange to say what had had such weight with him while they were there and while he mentally put himself at their point of view suddenly lost all importance for him he began to look at his picture with all his own full artist vision and was soon in that mood of conviction of the perfectibility and so of the significance of his picture a conviction essential to the most intense fervor excluding all other interests in which alone he could work christs foreshortened leg was not right though he took his palette and began to work as he corrected the leg he looked continually at the figure of john in the background which his visitors had not even noticed but which he knew was beyond perfection when he had finished the leg he wanted to touch that figure but he felt too much excited for it he was equally unable to work when he was cold and when he was too much affected and saw everything too much there was only one stage in the transition from coldness to inspiration at which work was possible today he was too much agitated he would have covered the picture but he stopped holding the cloth in his hand and smiling blissfully gazed a long while at the figure of john at last as it were regretfully tearing himself away he dropped the cloth and exhausted but happy went home vronsky anna and golenishtchev on their way home were
