you wouldnt believe he would say to his brother what a pleasure this rural laziness is to me not an idea in ones brain as empty as a drum but konstantin levin found it dull sitting and listening to him especially when he knew that while he was away they would be carting dung onto the fields not ploughed ready for it and heaping it all up anyhow and would not screw the shares in the ploughs but would let them come off and then say that the new ploughs were a silly invention and there was nothing like the old andreevna plough and so on come youve done enough trudging about in the heat sergey ivanovitch would say to him no i must just run round to the counting-house for a minute levin would answer and he would run off to the fields chapter early in june it happened that agafea mihalovna the old nurse and housekeeper in carrying to the cellar a jar of mushrooms she had just pickled slipped fell and sprained her wrist the district doctor a talkative young medical student who had just finished his studies came to see her he examined the wrist said it was not broken was delighted at a chance of talking to the celebrated sergey ivanovitch koznishev and to show his advanced views of things told him all the scandal of the district complaining of the poor state into which the district council had fallen sergey ivanovitch listened attentively asked him questions and roused by a new listener he talked fluently uttered a few keen and weighty observations respectfully appreciated by the young doctor and was soon in that eager frame of mind his brother knew so well which always with him followed a brilliant and eager conversation after the departure of the doctor he wanted to go with a fishing rod to the river sergey ivanovitch was fond of angling and was it seemed proud of being able to care for such a stupid occupation konstantin levin whose presence was needed in the plough land and meadows had come to take his brother in the trap it was that time of the year the turning-point of summer when the crops of the present year are a certainty when one begins to think of the sowing for next year and the mowing is at hand when the rye is all in ear though its ears are still light not yet full and it waves in gray-green billows in the wind when the green oats with tufts of yellow grass scattered here and there among it droop irregularly over the late-sown fields when the early buckwheat is already out and hiding the ground when the fallow lands trodden hard as stone by the cattle are half ploughed over with paths left untouched by the plough
