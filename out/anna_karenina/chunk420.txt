at the same work then he went on recalling that he had been told golenishtchev was writing something yes im writing the second part of the two elements said golenishtchev coloring with pleasure at the question that is to be exact i am not writing it yet i am preparing collecting materials it will be of far wider scope and will touch on almost all questions we in russia refuse to see that we are the heirs of byzantium and he launched into a long and heated explanation of his views vronsky at the first moment felt embarrassed at not even knowing of the first part of the two elements of which the author spoke as something well known but as golenishtchev began to lay down his opinions and vronsky was able to follow them even without knowing the two elements he listened to him with some interest for golenishtchev spoke well but vronsky was startled and annoyed by the nervous irascibility with which golenishtchev talked of the subject that engrossed him as he went on talking his eyes glittered more and more angrily he was more and more hurried in his replies to imaginary opponents and his face grew more and more excited and worried remembering golenishtchev a thin lively good-natured and well-bred boy always at the head of the class vronsky could not make out the reason of his irritability and he did not like it what he particularly disliked was that golenishtchev a man belonging to a good set should put himself on a level with some scribbling fellows with whom he was irritated and angry was it worth it vronsky disliked it yet he felt that golenishtchev was unhappy and was sorry for him unhappiness almost mental derangement was visible on his mobile rather handsome face while without even noticing annas coming in he went on hurriedly and hotly expressing his views when anna came in in her hat and cape and her lovely hand rapidly swinging her parasol and stood beside him it was with a feeling of relief that vronsky broke away from the plaintive eyes of golenishtchev which fastened persistently upon him and with a fresh rush of love looked at his charming companion full of life and happiness golenishtchev recovered himself with an effort and at first was dejected and gloomy but anna disposed to feel friendly with everyone as she was at that time soon revived his spirits by her direct and lively manner after trying various subjects of conversation she got him upon painting of which he talked very well and she listened to him attentively they walked to the house they had taken and looked over it i am very glad of one thing said anna to golenishtchev when they were on their way back alexey will have a capital atelier you
