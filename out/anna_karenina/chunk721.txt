there could be any sort of tendency and struggle in the eternal and i was astonished that in spite of the utmost effort of thought along that road i could not discover the meaning of life the meaning of my impulses and yearnings now i say that i know the meaning of my life to live for god for my soul and this meaning in spite of its clearness is mysterious and marvelous such indeed is the meaning of everything existing yes pride he said to himself turning over on his stomach and beginning to tie a noose of blades of grass trying not to break them and not merely pride of intellect but dulness of intellect and most of all the deceitfulness yes the deceitfulness of intellect the cheating knavishness of intellect thats it he said to himself and he briefly went through mentally the whole course of his ideas during the last two years the beginning of which was the clear confronting of death at the sight of his dear brother hopelessly ill then for the first time grasping that for every man and himself too there was nothing in store but suffering death and forgetfulness he had made up his mind that life was impossible like that and that he must either interpret life so that it would not present itself to him as the evil jest of some devil or shoot himself but he had not done either but had gone on living thinking and feeling and had even at that very time married and had had many joys and had been happy when he was not thinking of the meaning of his life what did this mean it meant that he had been living rightly but thinking wrongly he had lived without being aware of it on those spiritual truths that he had sucked in with his mothers milk but he had thought not merely without recognition of these truths but studiously ignoring them now it was clear to him that he could only live by virtue of the beliefs in which he had been brought up what should i have been and how should i have spent my life if i had not had these beliefs if i had not known that i must live for god and not for my own desires i should have robbed and lied and killed nothing of what makes the chief happiness of my life would have existed for me and with the utmost stretch of imagination he could not conceive the brutal creature he would have been himself if he had not known what he was living for i looked for an answer to my question and thought could not give an answer to my question it is incommensurable with my question the answer has been given me by life
