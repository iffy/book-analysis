that the only thing that answers is the money-lender system like that meek-looking gentlemans or else the very simplest whose fault is it our own of course besides its not true that it doesnt answer it answers with vassiltchikov a factory but i really dont know what it is you are surprised at the people are at such a low stage of rational and moral development that its obvious theyre bound to oppose everything thats strange to them in europe a rational system answers because the people are educated it follows that we must educate the people thats all but how are we to educate the people to educate the people three things are needed schools and schools and schools but you said yourself the people are at such a low stage of material development what help are schools for that do you know you remind me of the story of the advice given to the sick man you should try purgative medicine taken worse try leeches tried them worse well then theres nothing left but to pray to god tried it worse thats just how it is with us i say political economy you say worse i say socialism worse education worse but how do schools help matters they give the peasant fresh wants well thats a thing ive never understood levin replied with heat in what way are schools going to help the people to improve their material position you say schools education will give them fresh wants so much the worse since they wont be capable of satisfying them and in what way a knowledge of addition and subtraction and the catechism is going to improve their material condition i never could make out the day before yesterday i met a peasant woman in the evening with a little baby and asked her where she was going she said she was going to the wise woman her boy had screaming fits so she was taking him to be doctored i asked why how does the wise woman cure screaming fits she puts the child on the hen-roost and repeats some charm well youre saying it yourself whats wanted to prevent her taking her child to the hen-roost to cure it of screaming fits is just sviazhsky said smiling good-humoredly oh no said levin with annoyance that method of doctoring i merely meant as a simile for doctoring the people with schools the people are poor and ignorant that we see as surely as the peasant woman sees the baby is ill because it screams but in what way this trouble of poverty and ignorance is to be cured by schools is as incomprehensible as how the hen-roost affects the screaming what has to be cured is what makes him poor well in that at least youre in agreement with spencer
