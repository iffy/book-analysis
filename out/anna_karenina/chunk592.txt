a ballot put it to the vote no need for more talking then several voices began to talk all at once and the tall nobleman with the ring getting more and more exasperated shouted more and more loudly but it was impossible to make out what he said he was shouting for the very course sergey ivanovitch had proposed but it was evident that he hated him and all his party and this feeling of hatred spread through the whole party and roused in opposition to it the same vindictiveness though in a more seemly form on the other side shouts were raised and for a moment all was confusion so that the marshal of the province had to call for order a ballot a ballot every nobleman sees it we shed our blood for our country the confidence of the monarch no checking the accounts of the marshal hes not a cashier but thats not the point votes please beastly shouted furious and violent voices on all sides looks and faces were even more violent and furious than their words they expressed the most implacable hatred levin did not in the least understand what was the matter and he marveled at the passion with which it was disputed whether or not the decision about flerov should be put to the vote he forgot as sergey ivanovitch explained to him afterwards this syllogism that it was necessary for the public good to get rid of the marshal of the province that to get rid of the marshal it was necessary to have a majority of votes that to get a majority of votes it was necessary to secure flerovs right to vote that to secure the recognition of flerovs right to vote they must decide on the interpretation to be put on the act and one vote may decide the whole question and one must be serious and consecutive if one wants to be of use in public life concluded sergey ivanovitch but levin forgot all that and it was painful to him to see all these excellent persons for whom he had a respect in such an unpleasant and vicious state of excitement to escape from this painful feeling he went away into the other room where there was nobody except the waiters at the refreshment bar seeing the waiters busy over washing up the crockery and setting in order their plates and wine-glasses seeing their calm and cheerful faces levin felt an unexpected sense of relief as though he had come out of a stuffy room into the fresh air he began walking up and down looking with pleasure at the waiters he particularly liked the way one gray-whiskered waiter who showed his scorn for the other younger ones and was jeered at by them was teaching them how to fold
