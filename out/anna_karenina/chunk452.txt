nikolaevna terrible as it was to levin to put his arms round that terrible body to take hold of that under the quilt of which he preferred to know nothing under his wifes influence he made his resolute face that she knew so well and putting his arms into the bed took hold of the body but in spite of his own strength he was struck by the strange heaviness of those powerless limbs while he was turning him over conscious of the huge emaciated arm about his neck kitty swiftly and noiselessly turned the pillow beat it up and settled in it the sick mans head smoothing back his hair which was sticking again to his moist brow the sick man kept his brothers hand in his own levin felt that he meant to do something with his hand and was pulling it somewhere levin yielded with a sinking heart yes he drew it to his mouth and kissed it levin shaking with sobs and unable to articulate a word went out of the room chapter thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes so levin thought about his wife as he talked to her that evening levin thought of the text not because he considered himself wise and prudent he did not so consider himself but he could not help knowing that he had more intellect than his wife and agafea mihalovna and he could not help knowing that when he thought of death he thought with all the force of his intellect he knew too that the brains of many great men whose thoughts he had read had brooded over death and yet knew not a hundredth part of what his wife and agafea mihalovna knew about it different as those two women were agafea mihalovna and katya as his brother nikolay had called her and as levin particularly liked to call her now they were quite alike in this both knew without a shade of doubt what sort of thing life was and what was death and though neither of them could have answered and would even not have understood the questions that presented themselves to levin both had no doubt of the significance of this event and were precisely alike in their way of looking at it which they shared with millions of people the proof that they knew for a certainty the nature of death lay in the fact that they knew without a second of hesitation how to deal with the dying and were not frightened of them levin and other men like him though they could have said a great deal about death obviously did not know this since they were afraid of death and were absolutely at a loss what to do when people were dying
