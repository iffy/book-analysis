bear her off but she clung to the cold door post and holding her skirt got down onto the platform and under the shelter of the carriages the wind had been powerful on the steps but on the platform under the lee of the carriages there was a lull with enjoyment she drew deep breaths of the frozen snowy air and standing near the carriage looked about the platform and the lighted station chapter the raging tempest rushed whistling between the wheels of the carriages about the scaffolding and round the corner of the station the carriages posts people everything that was to be seen was covered with snow on one side and was getting more and more thickly covered for a moment there would come a lull in the storm but then it would swoop down again with such onslaughts that it seemed impossible to stand against it meanwhile men ran to and fro talking merrily together their steps crackling on the platform as they continually opened and closed the big doors the bent shadow of a man glided by at her feet and she heard sounds of a hammer upon iron hand over that telegram came an angry voice out of the stormy darkness on the other side this way no several different voices shouted again and muffled figures ran by covered with snow two gentlemen with lighted cigarettes passed by her she drew one more deep breath of the fresh air and had just put her hand out of her muff to take hold of the door post and get back into the carriage when another man in a military overcoat quite close beside her stepped between her and the flickering light of the lamp post she looked round and the same instant recognized vronskys face putting his hand to the peak of his cap he bowed to her and asked was there anything she wanted could he be of any service to her she gazed rather a long while at him without answering and in spite of the shadow in which he was standing she saw or fancied she saw both the expression of his face and his eyes it was again that expression of reverential ecstasy which had so worked upon her the day before more than once she had told herself during the past few days and again only a few moments before that vronsky was for her only one of the hundreds of young men forever exactly the same that are met everywhere that she would never allow herself to bestow a thought upon him but now at the first instant of meeting him she was seized by a feeling of joyful pride she had no need to ask why he had come she knew as certainly as if he had told her that he was here
