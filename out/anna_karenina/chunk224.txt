mean just like one of the peasants all day long yes its very pleasant said levin its splendid as exercise only youll hardly be able to stand it said sergey ivanovitch without a shade of irony ive tried it its hard work at first but you get into it i dare say i shall manage to keep it up really what an idea but tell me how do the peasants look at it i suppose they laugh in their sleeves at their masters being such a queer fish no i dont think so but its so delightful and at the same time such hard work that one has no time to think about it but how will you do about dining with them to send you a bottle of lafitte and roast turkey out there would be a little awkward no ill simply come home at the time of their noonday rest next morning konstantin levin got up earlier than usual but he was detained giving directions on the farm and when he reached the mowing grass the mowers were already at their second row from the uplands he could get a view of the shaded cut part of the meadow below with its grayish ridges of cut grass and the black heaps of coats taken off by the mowers at the place from which they had started cutting gradually as he rode towards the meadow the peasants came into sight some in coats some in their shirts mowing one behind another in a long string swinging their scythes differently he counted forty-two of them they were mowing slowly over the uneven low-lying parts of the meadow where there had been an old dam levin recognized some of his own men here was old yermil in a very long white smock bending forward to swing a scythe there was a young fellow vaska who had been a coachman of levins taking every row with a wide sweep here too was tit levins preceptor in the art of mowing a thin little peasant he was in front of all and cut his wide row without bending as though playing with the scythe levin got off his mare and fastening her up by the roadside went to meet tit who took a second scythe out of a bush and gave it to him its ready sir its like a razor cuts of itself said tit taking off his cap with a smile and giving him the scythe levin took the scythe and began trying it as they finished their rows the mowers hot and good-humored came out into the road one after another and laughing a little greeted the master they all stared at him but no one made any remark till a tall old man with a wrinkled beardless face wearing a short sheepskin jacket
