schools what do you mean can there be two opinions of the advantage of education if its a good thing for you its a good thing for everyone konstantin levin felt himself morally pinned against a wall and so he got hot and unconsciously blurted out the chief cause of his indifference to public business perhaps it may all be very good but why should i worry myself about establishing dispensaries which i shall never make use of and schools to which i shall never send my children to which even the peasants dont want to send their children and to which ive no very firm faith that they ought to send them said he sergey ivanovitch was for a minute surprised at this unexpected view of the subject but he promptly made a new plan of attack he was silent for a little drew out a hook threw it in again and turned to his brother smiling come now in the first place the dispensary is needed we ourselves sent for the district doctor for agafea mihalovna oh well but i fancy her wrist will never be straight again that remains to be proved next the peasant who can read and write is as a workman of more use and value to you no you can ask anyone you like konstantin levin answered with decision the man that can read and write is much inferior as a workman and mending the highroads is an impossibility and as soon as they put up bridges theyre stolen still thats not the point said sergey ivanovitch frowning he disliked contradiction and still more arguments that were continually skipping from one thing to another introducing new and disconnected points so that there was no knowing to which to reply do you admit that education is a benefit for the people yes i admit it said levin without thinking and he was conscious immediately that he had said what he did not think he felt that if he admitted that it would be proved that he had been talking meaningless rubbish how it would be proved he could not tell but he knew that this would inevitably be logically proved to him and he awaited the proofs the argument turned out to be far simpler than he had expected if you admit that it is a benefit said sergey ivanovitch then as an honest man you cannot help caring about it and sympathizing with the movement and so wishing to work for it but i still do not admit this movement to be just said konstantin levin reddening a little what but you said just now thats to say i dont admit its being either good or possible that you cant tell without making the trial well supposing thats so said levin though he did not suppose so
