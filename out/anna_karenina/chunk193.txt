sent to alexey to find out how he is and he writes me he is quite well and unhurt but in despair so he will be here she thought what a good thing i told him all she glanced at her watch she had still three hours to wait and the memories of their last meeting set her blood in flame my god how light it is its dreadful but i do love to see his face and i do love this fantastic light my husband oh yes well thank god everythings over with him chapter in the little german watering-place to which the shtcherbatskys had betaken themselves as in all places indeed where people are gathered together the usual process as it were of the crystallization of society went on assigning to each member of that society a definite and unalterable place just as the particle of water in frost definitely and unalterably takes the special form of the crystal of snow so each new person that arrived at the springs was at once placed in his special place frst shtcherbatsky sammt gemahlin und tochter by the apartments they took and from their name and from the friends they made were immediately crystallized into a definite place marked out for them there was visiting the watering-place that year a real german frstin in consequence of which the crystallizing process went on more vigorously than ever princess shtcherbatskaya wished above everything to present her daughter to this german princess and the day after their arrival she duly performed this rite kitty made a low and graceful curtsey in the very simple that is to say very elegant frock that had been ordered her from paris the german princess said i hope the roses will soon come back to this pretty little face and for the shtcherbatskys certain definite lines of existence were at once laid down from which there was no departing the shtcherbatskys made the acquaintance too of the family of an english lady somebody and of a german countess and her son wounded in the last war and of a learned swede and of m canut and his sister but yet inevitably the shtcherbatskys were thrown most into the society of a moscow lady marya yevgenyevna rtishtcheva and her daughter whom kitty disliked because she had fallen ill like herself over a love affair and a moscow colonel whom kitty had known from childhood and always seen in uniform and epaulets and who now with his little eyes and his open neck and flowered cravat was uncommonly ridiculous and tedious because there was no getting rid of him when all this was so firmly established kitty began to be very much bored especially as the prince went away to carlsbad and she was left alone with her mother she took no interest
