its impossible impossible im so glad you think so said stepan arkadyevitch shaking his head with a serious and sympathetically distressed expression thats what ive come to petersburg for the whole towns talking of it she said its an impossible position she pines and pines away he doesnt understand that shes one of those women who cant trifle with their feelings one of two things either let him take her away act with energy or give her a divorce this is stifling her yes yes just so oblonsky said sighing thats what ive come for at least not solely for that ive been made a kammerherr of course one has to say thank you but the chief thing was having to settle this well god help you said betsy after accompanying betsy to the outside hall once more kissing her hand above the glove at the point where the pulse beats and murmuring to her such unseemly nonsense that she did not know whether to laugh or be angry stepan arkadyevitch went to his sister he found her in tears although he happened to be bubbling over with good spirits stepan arkadyevitch immediately and quite naturally fell into the sympathetic poetically emotional tone which harmonized with her mood he asked her how she was and how she had spent the morning very very miserably today and this morning and all past days and days to come she said i think youre giving way to pessimism you must rouse yourself you must look life in the face i know its hard but i have heard it said that women love men even for their vices anna began suddenly but i hate him for his virtues i cant live with him do you understand the sight of him has a physical effect on me it makes me beside myself i cant i cant live with him what am i to do i have been unhappy and used to think one couldnt be more unhappy but the awful state of things i am going through now i could never have conceived would you believe it that knowing hes a good man a splendid man that im not worth his little finger still i hate him i hate him for his generosity and theres nothing left for me but she would have said death but stepan arkadyevitch would not let her finish you are ill and overwrought he said believe me youre exaggerating dreadfully theres nothing so terrible in it and stepan arkadyevitch smiled no one else in stepan arkadyevitchs place having to do with such despair would have ventured to smile the smile would have seemed brutal but in his smile there was so much of sweetness and almost feminine tenderness that his smile did not wound but softened and soothed his gentle soothing words and
