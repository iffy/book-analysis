as to be duly naked as she moved forward towards the footlights into the light of the gas and the sight of all eyes vronsky drove to the french theater where he really had to see the colonel of his regiment who never missed a single performance there he wanted to see him to report on the result of his mediation which had occupied and amused him for the last three days petritsky whom he liked was implicated in the affair and the other culprit was a capital fellow and first-rate comrade who had lately joined the regiment the young prince kedrov and what was most important the interests of the regiment were involved in it too both the young men were in vronskys company the colonel of the regiment was waited upon by the government clerk venden with a complaint against his officers who had insulted his wife his young wife so venden told the story he had been married half a year was at church with her mother and suddenly overcome by indisposition arising from her interesting condition she could not remain standing she drove home in the first sledge a smart-looking one she came across on the spot the officers set off in pursuit of her she was alarmed and feeling still more unwell ran up the staircase home venden himself on returning from his office heard a ring at their bell and voices went out and seeing the intoxicated officers with a letter he had turned them out he asked for exemplary punishment yes its all very well said the colonel to vronsky whom he had invited to come and see him petritskys becoming impossible not a week goes by without some scandal this government clerk wont let it drop hell go on with the thing vronsky saw all the thanklessness of the business and that there could be no question of a duel in it that everything must be done to soften the government clerk and hush the matter up the colonel had called in vronsky just because he knew him to be an honorable and intelligent man and more than all a man who cared for the honor of the regiment they talked it over and decided that petritsky and kedrov must go with vronsky to vendens to apologize the colonel and vronsky were both fully aware that vronskys name and rank would be sure to contribute greatly to the softening of the injured husbands feelings and these two influences were not in fact without effect though the result remained as vronsky had described uncertain on reaching the french theater vronsky retired to the foyer with the colonel and reported to him his success or non-success the colonel thinking it all over made up his mind not to pursue the matter further but then for his own satisfaction
