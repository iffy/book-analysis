rational and it has a future just like christianity in its first ages all that i maintain is that the labor force ought to be investigated from the point of view of natural science that is to say it ought to be studied its qualities ascertained but thats utter waste of time that force finds a certain form of activity of itself according to the stage of its development there have been slaves first everywhere then metayers and we have the half-crop system rent and day laborers what are you trying to find levin suddenly lost his temper at these words because at the bottom of his heart he was afraid that it was true true that he was trying to hold the balance even between communism and the familiar forms and that this was hardly possible i am trying to find means of working productively for myself and for the laborers i want to organize he answered hotly you dont want to organize anything its simply just as youve been all your life that you want to be original to pose as not exploiting the peasants simply but with some idea in view oh all right thats what you think and let me alone answered levin feeling the muscles of his left cheek twitching uncontrollably youve never had and never have convictions all you want is to please your vanity oh very well then let me alone and i will let you alone and its high time i did and go to the devil with you and im very sorry i ever came in spite of all levins efforts to soothe his brother afterwards nikolay would listen to nothing he said declaring that it was better to part and konstantin saw that it simply was that life was unbearable to him nikolay was just getting ready to go when konstantin went in to him again and begged him rather unnaturally to forgive him if he had hurt his feelings in any way ah generosity said nikolay and he smiled if you want to be right i can give you that satisfaction youre in the right but im going all the same it was only just at parting that nikolay kissed him and said looking with sudden strangeness and seriousness at his brother anyway dont remember evil against me kostya and his voice quivered these were the only words that had been spoken sincerely between them levin knew that those words meant you see and you know that im in a bad way and maybe we shall not see each other again levin knew this and the tears gushed from his eyes he kissed his brother once more but he could not speak and knew not what to say three days after his brothers departure levin too set off for his foreign tour
