victim killed or wounded its even more senseless but apart from that a challenge to fight would be an act hardly honest on my side dont i know perfectly well that my friends would never allow me to fight a duel would never allow the life of a statesman needed by russia to be exposed to danger knowing perfectly well beforehand that the matter would never come to real danger it would amount to my simply trying to gain a certain sham reputation by such a challenge that would be dishonest that would be false that would be deceiving myself and others a duel is quite irrational and no one expects it of me my aim is simply to safeguard my reputation which is essential for the uninterrupted pursuit of my public duties official duties which had always been of great consequence in alexey alexandrovitchs eyes seemed of special importance to his mind at this moment considering and rejecting the duel alexey alexandrovitch turned to divorce another solution selected by several of the husbands he remembered passing in mental review all the instances he knew of divorces there were plenty of them in the very highest society with which he was very familiar alexey alexandrovitch could not find a single example in which the object of divorce was that which he had in view in all these instances the husband had practically ceded or sold his unfaithful wife and the very party which being in fault had not the right to contract a fresh marriage had formed counterfeit pseudo-matrimonial ties with a self-styled husband in his own case alexey alexandrovitch saw that a legal divorce that is to say one in which only the guilty wife would be repudiated was impossible of attainment he saw that the complex conditions of the life they led made the coarse proofs of his wifes guilt required by the law out of the question he saw that a certain refinement in that life would not admit of such proofs being brought forward even if he had them and that to bring forward such proofs would damage him in the public estimation more than it would her an attempt at divorce could lead to nothing but a public scandal which would be a perfect godsend to his enemies for calumny and attacks on his high position in society his chief object to define the position with the least amount of disturbance possible would not be attained by divorce either moreover in the event of divorce or even of an attempt to obtain a divorce it was obvious that the wife broke off all relations with the husband and threw in her lot with the lover and in spite of the complete as he supposed contempt and indifference he now felt for his wife at the bottom of his heart
