the immense sums cost him by the hospital by machinery by cows ordered from switzerland and many other things he was convinced that he was not wasting but increasing his substance in all matters affecting income the sales of timber wheat and wool the letting of lands vronsky was hard as a rock and knew well how to keep up prices in all operations on a large scale on this and his other estates he kept to the simplest methods involving no risk and in trifling details he was careful and exacting to an extreme degree in spite of all the cunning and ingenuity of the german steward who would try to tempt him into purchases by making his original estimate always far larger than really required and then representing to vronsky that he might get the thing cheaper and so make a profit vronsky did not give in he listened to his steward cross-examined him and only agreed to his suggestions when the implement to be ordered or constructed was the very newest not yet known in russia and likely to excite wonder apart from such exceptions he resolved upon an increased outlay only where there was a surplus and in making such an outlay he went into the minutest details and insisted on getting the very best for his money so that by the method on which he managed his affairs it was clear that he was not wasting but increasing his substance in october there were the provincial elections in the kashinsky province where were the estates of vronsky sviazhsky koznishev oblonsky and a small part of levins land these elections were attracting public attention from several circumstances connected with them and also from the people taking part in them there had been a great deal of talk about them and great preparations were being made for them persons who never attended the elections were coming from moscow from petersburg and from abroad to attend these vronsky had long before promised sviazhsky to go to them before the elections sviazhsky who often visited vozdvizhenskoe drove over to fetch vronsky on the day before there had been almost a quarrel between vronsky and anna over this proposed expedition it was the very dullest autumn weather which is so dreary in the country and so preparing himself for a struggle vronsky with a hard and cold expression informed anna of his departure as he had never spoken to her before but to his surprise anna accepted the information with great composure and merely asked when he would be back he looked intently at her at a loss to explain this composure she smiled at his look he knew that way she had of withdrawing into herself and knew that it only happened when she had determined upon something without letting him know
