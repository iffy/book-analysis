was a horrid woman she caused me all sorts of worries but he did not say what the annoyances were he could not say that he had cast off marya nikolaevna because the tea was weak and above all because she would look after him as though he were an invalid besides i want to turn over a new leaf completely now ive done silly things of course like everyone else but moneys the last consideration i dont regret it so long as theres health and my health thank god is quite restored levin listened and racked his brains but could think of nothing to say nikolay probably felt the same he began questioning his brother about his affairs and levin was glad to talk about himself because then he could speak without hypocrisy he told his brother of his plans and his doings his brother listened but evidently he was not interested by it these two men were so akin so near each other that the slightest gesture the tone of voice told both more than could be said in words both of them now had only one thought the illness of nikolay and the nearness of his death which stifled all else but neither of them dared to speak of it and so whatever they said not uttering the one thought that filled their minds was all falsehood never had levin been so glad when the evening was over and it was time to go to bed never with any outside person never on any official visit had he been so unnatural and false as he was that evening and the consciousness of this unnaturalness and the remorse he felt at it made him even more unnatural he wanted to weep over his dying dearly loved brother and he had to listen and keep on talking of how he meant to live as the house was damp and only one bedroom had been kept heated levin put his brother to sleep in his own bedroom behind a screen his brother got into bed and whether he slept or did not sleep tossed about like a sick man coughed and when he could not get his throat clear mumbled something sometimes when his breathing was painful he said oh my god sometimes when he was choking he muttered angrily ah the devil levin could not sleep for a long while hearing him his thoughts were of the most various but the end of all his thoughts was the same death death the inevitable end of all for the first time presented itself to him with irresistible force and death which was here in this loved brother groaning half asleep and from habit calling without distinction on god and the devil was not so remote as it had hitherto seemed to him it
