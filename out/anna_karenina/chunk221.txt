at all supposing that is so still i dont see all the same what im to worry myself about it for how so no since we are talking explain it to me from the philosophical point of view said levin i cant see where philosophy comes in said sergey ivanovitch in a tone levin fancied as though he did not admit his brothers right to talk about philosophy and that irritated levin ill tell you then he said with heat i imagine the mainspring of all our actions is after all self-interest now in the local institutions i as a nobleman see nothing that could conduce to my prosperity and the roads are not better and could not be better my horses carry me well enough over bad ones doctors and dispensaries are no use to me an arbitrator of disputes is no use to me i never appeal to him and never shall appeal to him the schools are no good to me but positively harmful as i told you for me the district institutions simply mean the liability to pay fourpence halfpenny for every three acres to drive into the town sleep with bugs and listen to all sorts of idiocy and loathsomeness and self-interest offers me no inducement excuse me sergey ivanovitch interposed with a smile self-interest did not induce us to work for the emancipation of the serfs but we did work for it no konstantin levin broke in with still greater heat the emancipation of the serfs was a different matter there self-interest did come in one longed to throw off that yoke that crushed us all decent people among us but to be a town councilor and discuss how many dustmen are needed and how chimneys shall be constructed in the town in which i dont live to serve on a jury and try a peasant whos stolen a flitch of bacon and listen for six hours at a stretch to all sorts of jabber from the counsel for the defense and the prosecution and the president cross-examining my old half-witted alioshka do you admit prisoner in the dock the fact of the removal of the bacon eh konstantin levin had warmed to his subject and began mimicking the president and the half-witted alioshka it seemed to him that it was all to the point but sergey ivanovitch shrugged his shoulders well what do you mean to say then i simply mean to say that those rights that touch me my interest i shall always defend to the best of my ability that when they made raids on us students and the police read our letters i was ready to defend those rights to the utmost to defend my rights to education and freedom i can understand compulsory military service which affects my children my brothers and myself
