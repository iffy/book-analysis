personal individual will sergey ivanovitch and katavasov had their replies ready and both began speaking at the same time but the point is my dear fellow that there may be cases when the government does not carry out the will of the citizens and then the public asserts its will said katavasov but evidently sergey ivanovitch did not approve of this answer his brows contracted at katavasovs words and he said something else you dont put the matter in its true light there is no question here of a declaration of war but simply the expression of a human christian feeling our brothers one with us in religion and in race are being massacred even supposing they were not our brothers nor fellow-christians but simply children women old people feeling is aroused and russians go eagerly to help in stopping these atrocities fancy if you were going along the street and saw drunken men beating a woman or a child i imagine you would not stop to inquire whether war had been declared on the men but would throw yourself on them and protect the victim but i should not kill them said levin yes you would kill them i dont know if i saw that i might give way to my impulse of the moment but i cant say beforehand and such a momentary impulse there is not and there cannot be in the case of the oppression of the slavonic peoples possibly for you there is not but for others there is said sergey ivanovitch frowning with displeasure there are traditions still extant among the people of slavs of the true faith suffering under the yoke of the unclean sons of hagar the people have heard of the sufferings of their brethren and have spoken perhaps so said levin evasively but i dont see it im one of the people myself and i dont feel it here am i too said the old prince ive been staying abroad and reading the papers and i must own up to the time of the bulgarian atrocities i couldnt make out why it was all the russians were all of a sudden so fond of their slavonic brethren while i didnt feel the slightest affection for them i was very much upset thought i was a monster or that it was the influence of carlsbad on me but since i have been here my minds been set at rest i see that there are people besides me whore only interested in russia and not in their slavonic brethren heres konstantin too personal opinions mean nothing in such a case said sergey ivanovitch its not a matter of personal opinions when all russia the whole people has expressed its will but excuse me i dont see that the people dont know anything about it if
