had looked at her when he came to tell her he was going had wounded her and before he had started her peace of mind was destroyed in solitude afterwards thinking over that glance which had expressed his right to freedom she came as she always did to the same point the sense of her own humiliation he has the right to go away when and where he chooses not simply to go away but to leave me he has every right and i have none but knowing that he ought not to do it what has he done though he looked at me with a cold severe expression of course that is something indefinable impalpable but it has never been so before and that glance means a great deal she thought that glance shows the beginning of indifference and though she felt sure that a coldness was beginning there was nothing she could do she could not in any way alter her relations to him just as before only by love and by charm could she keep him and so just as before only by occupation in the day by morphine at night could she stifle the fearful thought of what would be if he ceased to love her it is true there was still one means not to keep him for that she wanted nothing more than his love but to be nearer to him to be in such a position that he would not leave her that means was divorce and marriage and she began to long for that and made up her mind to agree to it the first time he or stiva approached her on the subject absorbed in such thoughts she passed five days without him the five days that he was to be at the elections walks conversation with princess varvara visits to the hospital and most of all reading reading of one book after another filled up her time but on the sixth day when the coachman came back without him she felt that now she was utterly incapable of stifling the thought of him and of what he was doing there just at that time her little girl was taken ill anna began to look after her but even that did not distract her mind especially as the illness was not serious however hard she tried she could not love this little child and to feign love was beyond her powers towards the evening of that day still alone anna was in such a panic about him that she decided to start for the town but on second thoughts wrote him the contradictory letter that vronsky received and without reading it through sent it off by a special messenger the next morning she received his letter and regretted her own she dreaded a repetition
