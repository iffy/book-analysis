sought at every convenient opportunity to remind him that she remembered his generosity and appreciated it to grasp the impossibility of taking back his gift it was as impossible as beating a woman stealing or lying one thing only could and ought to be done and vronsky determined upon it without an instants hesitation to borrow money from a money-lender ten thousand roubles a proceeding which presented no difficulty to cut down his expenses generally and to sell his race horses resolving on this he promptly wrote a note to rolandak who had more than once sent to him with offers to buy horses from him then he sent for the englishman and the money-lender and divided what money he had according to the accounts he intended to pay having finished this business he wrote a cold and cutting answer to his mother then he took out of his notebook three notes of annas read them again burned them and remembering their conversation on the previous day he sank into meditation chapter vronskys life was particularly happy in that he had a code of principles which defined with unfailing certitude what he ought and what he ought not to do this code of principles covered only a very small circle of contingencies but then the principles were never doubtful and vronsky as he never went outside that circle had never had a moments hesitation about doing what he ought to do these principles laid down as invariable rules that one must pay a cardsharper but need not pay a tailor that one must never tell a lie to a man but one may to a woman that one must never cheat anyone but one may a husband that one must never pardon an insult but one may give one and so on these principles were possibly not reasonable and not good but they were of unfailing certainty and so long as he adhered to them vronsky felt that his heart was at peace and he could hold his head up only quite lately in regard to his relations with anna vronsky had begun to feel that his code of principles did not fully cover all possible contingencies and to foresee in the future difficulties and perplexities for which he could find no guiding clue his present relation to anna and to her husband was to his mind clear and simple it was clearly and precisely defined in the code of principles by which he was guided she was an honorable woman who had bestowed her love upon him and he loved her and therefore she was in his eyes a woman who had a right to the same or even more respect than a lawful wife he would have had his hand chopped off before he would have allowed himself by a word
