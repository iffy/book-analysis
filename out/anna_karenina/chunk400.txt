had nothing to talk about as was almost always the case at this time and laying her hand on the table she kept opening and shutting it and laughed herself as she watched her action he remembered how he had kissed it and then had examined the lines on the pink palm have mercy on us again thought levin crossing himself bowing and looking at the supple spring of the deacons back bowing before him she took my hand then and examined the lines youve got a splendid hand she said and he looked at his own hand and the short hand of the deacon yes now it will soon be over he thought no it seems to be beginning again he thought listening to the prayers no its just ending there he is bowing down to the ground thats always at the end the deacons hand in a plush cuff accepted a three-rouble note unobtrusively and the deacon said he would put it down in the register and his new boots creaking jauntily over the flagstones of the empty church he went to the altar a moment later he peeped out thence and beckoned to levin thought till then locked up began to stir in levins head but he made haste to drive it away it will come right somehow he thought and went towards the altar-rails he went up the steps and turning to the right saw the priest the priest a little old man with a scanty grizzled beard and weary good-natured eyes was standing at the altar-rails turning over the pages of a missal with a slight bow to levin he began immediately reading prayers in the official voice when he had finished them he bowed down to the ground and turned facing levin christ is present here unseen receiving your confession he said pointing to the crucifix do you believe in all the doctrines of the holy apostolic church the priest went on turning his eyes away from levins face and folding his hands under his stole i have doubted i doubt everything said levin in a voice that jarred on himself and he ceased speaking the priest waited a few seconds to see if he would not say more and closing his eyes he said quickly with a broad vladimirsky accent doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind but we must pray that god in his mercy will strengthen us what are your special sins he added without the slightest interval as though anxious not to waste time my chief sin is doubt i have doubts of everything and for the most part i am in doubt doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind the priest repeated the same words what do you doubt about principally i doubt of everything i sometimes even have doubts
