put a different interpretation on this passing expression of hardness when she got her husbands letter she knew then at the bottom of her heart that everything would go on in the old way that she would not have the strength of will to forego her position to abandon her son and to join her lover the morning spent at princess tverskayas had confirmed her still more in this but this interview was still of the utmost gravity for her she hoped that this interview would transform her position and save her if on hearing this news he were to say to her resolutely passionately without an instants wavering throw up everything and come with me she would give up her son and go away with him but this news had not produced what she had expected in him he simply seemed as though he were resenting some affront it was not in the least painful to me it happened of itself she said irritably and see she pulled her husbands letter out of her glove i understand i understand he interrupted her taking the letter but not reading it and trying to soothe her the one thing i longed for the one thing i prayed for was to cut short this position so as to devote my life to your happiness why do you tell me that she said do you suppose i can doubt it if i doubted whos that coming said vronsky suddenly pointing to two ladies walking towards them perhaps they know us and he hurriedly turned off drawing her after him into a side path oh i dont care she said her lips were quivering and he fancied that her eyes looked with strange fury at him from under the veil i tell you thats not the point i cant doubt that but see what he writes to me read it she stood still again again just as at the first moment of hearing of her rupture with her husband vronsky on reading the letter was unconsciously carried away by the natural sensation aroused in him by his own relation to the betrayed husband now while he held his letter in his hands he could not help picturing the challenge which he would most likely find at home today or tomorrow and the duel itself in which with the same cold and haughty expression that his face was assuming at this moment he would await the injured husbands shot after having himself fired into the air and at that instant there flashed across his mind the thought of what serpuhovskoy had just said to him and what he had himself been thinking in the morning that it was better not to bind himself and he knew that this thought he could not tell her having read the letter
