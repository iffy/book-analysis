ivanovitchs eyes his younger brother was a capital fellow with his heart in the right place as he expressed it in french but with a mind which though fairly quick was too much influenced by the impressions of the moment and consequently filled with contradictions with all the condescension of an elder brother he sometimes explained to him the true import of things but he derived little satisfaction from arguing with him because he got the better of him too easily konstantin levin regarded his brother as a man of immense intellect and culture as generous in the highest sense of the word and possessed of a special faculty for working for the public good but in the depths of his heart the older he became and the more intimately he knew his brother the more and more frequently the thought struck him that this faculty of working for the public good of which he felt himself utterly devoid was possibly not so much a quality as a lack of something not a lack of good honest noble desires and tastes but a lack of vital force of what is called heart of that impulse which drives a man to choose someone out of the innumerable paths of life and to care only for that one the better he knew his brother the more he noticed that sergey ivanovitch and many other people who worked for the public welfare were not led by an impulse of the heart to care for the public good but reasoned from intellectual considerations that it was a right thing to take interest in public affairs and consequently took interest in them levin was confirmed in this generalization by observing that his brother did not take questions affecting the public welfare or the question of the immortality of the soul a bit more to heart than he did chess problems or the ingenious construction of a new machine besides this konstantin levin was not at his ease with his brother because in summer in the country levin was continually busy with work on the land and the long summer day was not long enough for him to get through all he had to do while sergey ivanovitch was taking a holiday but though he was taking a holiday now that is to say he was doing no writing he was so used to intellectual activity that he liked to put into concise and eloquent shape the ideas that occurred to him and liked to have someone to listen to him his most usual and natural listener was his brother and so in spite of the friendliness and directness of their relations konstantin felt an awkwardness in leaving him alone sergey ivanovitch liked to stretch himself on the grass in the sun and to lie so basking and chatting lazily
