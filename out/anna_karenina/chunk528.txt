this sound for the flying of a grouse he heard too not far behind him a splashing in the water which he could not explain to himself picking his steps he moved up to the dog fetch it not a grouse but a snipe flew up from beside the dog levin had lifted his gun but at the very instant when he was taking aim the sound of splashing grew louder came closer and was joined with the sound of veslovskys voice shouting something with strange loudness levin saw he had his gun pointed behind the snipe but still he fired when he had made sure he had missed levin looked round and saw the horses and the wagonette not on the road but in the marsh veslovsky eager to see the shooting had driven into the marsh and got the horses stuck in the mud damn the fellow levin said to himself as he went back to the carriage that had sunk in the mire what did you drive in for he said to him dryly and calling the coachman he began pulling the horses out levin was vexed both at being hindered from shooting and at his horses getting stuck in the mud and still more at the fact that neither stepan arkadyevitch nor veslovsky helped him and the coachman to unharness the horses and get them out since neither of them had the slightest notion of harnessing without vouchsafing a syllable in reply to vassenkas protestations that it had been quite dry there levin worked in silence with the coachman at extricating the horses but then as he got warm at the work and saw how assiduously veslovsky was tugging at the wagonette by one of the mud-guards so that he broke it indeed levin blamed himself for having under the influence of yesterdays feelings been too cold to veslovsky and tried to be particularly genial so as to smooth over his chilliness when everything had been put right and the carriage had been brought back to the road levin had the lunch served bon apptit bonne conscience ce poulet va tomber jusquau fond de mes bottes vassenka who had recovered his spirits quoted the french saying as he finished his second chicken well now our troubles are over now everythings going to go well only to atone for my sins im bound to sit on the box thats so eh no no ill be your automedon you shall see how ill get you along he answered not letting go the rein when levin begged him to let the coachman drive no i must atone for my sins and im very comfortable on the box and he drove levin was a little afraid he would exhaust the horses especially the chestnut whom he did not know how to hold in
