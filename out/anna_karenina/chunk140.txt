masters eye so theyre sowing clover behind the birch dale ill go and have a look at them he said getting on to the little bay cob kolpik who was led up by the coachman you cant get across the streams konstantin dmitrievitch the coachman shouted all right ill go by the forest and levin rode through the slush of the farmyard to the gate and out into the open country his good little horse after his long inactivity stepping out gallantly snorting over the pools and asking as it were for guidance if levin had felt happy before in the cattle pens and farmyard he felt happier yet in the open country swaying rhythmically with the ambling paces of his good little cob drinking in the warm yet fresh scent of the snow and the air as he rode through his forest over the crumbling wasted snow still left in parts and covered with dissolving tracks he rejoiced over every tree with the moss reviving on its bark and the buds swelling on its shoots when he came out of the forest in the immense plain before him his grass fields stretched in an unbroken carpet of green without one bare place or swamp only spotted here and there in the hollows with patches of melting snow he was not put out of temper even by the sight of the peasants horses and colts trampling down his young grass he told a peasant he met to drive them out nor by the sarcastic and stupid reply of the peasant ipat whom he met on the way and asked well ipat shall we soon be sowing we must get the ploughing done first konstantin dmitrievitch answered ipat the further he rode the happier he became and plans for the land rose to his mind each better than the last to plant all his fields with hedges along the southern borders so that the snow should not lie under them to divide them up into six fields of arable and three of pasture and hay to build a cattle yard at the further end of the estate and to dig a pond and to construct movable pens for the cattle as a means of manuring the land and then eight hundred acres of wheat three hundred of potatoes and four hundred of clover and not one acre exhausted absorbed in such dreams carefully keeping his horse by the hedges so as not to trample his young crops he rode up to the laborers who had been sent to sow clover a cart with the seed in it was standing not at the edge but in the middle of the crop and the winter corn had been torn up by the wheels and trampled by the horse both the laborers were sitting in the hedge probably
