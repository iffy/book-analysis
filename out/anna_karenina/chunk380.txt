then the queer posture of alexey alexandrovitch on the floor beside the bed to sleep to forget he said to himself with the serene confidence of a healthy man that if he is tired and sleepy he will go to sleep at once and the same instant his head did begin to feel drowsy and he began to drop off into forgetfulness the waves of the sea of unconsciousness had begun to meet over his head when all at once it was as though a violent shock of electricity had passed over him he started so that he leaped up on the springs of the sofa and leaning on his arms got in a panic onto his knees his eyes were wide open as though he had never been asleep the heaviness in his head and the weariness in his limbs that he had felt a minute before had suddenly gone you may trample me in the mud he heard alexey alexandrovitchs words and saw him standing before him and saw annas face with its burning flush and glittering eyes gazing with love and tenderness not at him but at alexey alexandrovitch he saw his own as he fancied foolish and ludicrous figure when alexey alexandrovitch took his hands away from his face he stretched out his legs again and flung himself on the sofa in the same position and shut his eyes to sleep to forget he repeated to himself but with his eyes shut he saw more distinctly than ever annas face as it had been on the memorable evening before the races that is not and will not be and she wants to wipe it out of her memory but i cannot live without it how can we be reconciled how can we be reconciled he said aloud and unconsciously began to repeat these words this repetition checked the rising up of fresh images and memories which he felt were thronging in his brain but repeating words did not check his imagination for long again in extraordinarily rapid succession his best moments rose before his mind and then his recent humiliation take away his hands annas voice says he takes away his hands and feels the shamestruck and idiotic expression of his face he still lay down trying to sleep though he felt there was not the smallest hope of it and kept repeating stray words from some chain of thought trying by this to check the rising flood of fresh images he listened and heard in a strange mad whisper words repeated i did not appreciate it did not make enough of it i did not appreciate it did not make enough of it whats this am i going out of my mind he said to himself perhaps what makes men go out of their minds what makes men
