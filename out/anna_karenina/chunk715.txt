and less till it vanished into nothing but now since his marriage when he had begun to confine himself more and more to living for himself though he experienced no delight at all at the thought of the work he was doing he felt a complete conviction of its necessity saw that it succeeded far better than in old days and that it kept on growing more and more now involuntarily it seemed he cut more and more deeply into the soil like a plough so that he could not be drawn out without turning aside the furrow to live the same family life as his father and forefathers that is in the same condition of culture and to bring up his children in the same was incontestably necessary it was as necessary as dining when one was hungry and to do this just as it was necessary to cook dinner it was necessary to keep the mechanism of agriculture at pokrovskoe going so as to yield an income just as incontestably as it was necessary to repay a debt was it necessary to keep the property in such a condition that his son when he received it as a heritage would say thank you to his father as levin had said thank you to his grandfather for all he built and planted and to do this it was necessary to look after the land himself not to let it and to breed cattle manure the fields and plant timber it was impossible not to look after the affairs of sergey ivanovitch of his sister of the peasants who came to him for advice and were accustomed to do so as impossible as to fling down a child one is carrying in ones arms it was necessary to look after the comfort of his sister-in-law and her children and of his wife and baby and it was impossible not to spend with them at least a short time each day and all this together with shooting and his new bee-keeping filled up the whole of levins life which had no meaning at all for him when he began to think but besides knowing thoroughly what he had to do levin knew in just the same way how he had to do it all and what was more important than the rest he knew he must hire laborers as cheaply as possible but to hire men under bond paying them in advance at less than the current rate of wages was what he must not do even though it was very profitable selling straw to the peasants in times of scarcity of provender was what he might do even though he felt sorry for them but the tavern and the pothouse must be put down though they were a source of income felling timber
