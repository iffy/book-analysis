benediction and announcement can take place now thats very well the princess went up to her husband kissed him and would have gone away but he kept her embraced her and tenderly as a young lover kissed her several times smiling the old people were obviously muddled for a moment and did not quite know whether it was they who were in love again or their daughter when the prince and the princess had gone levin went up to his betrothed and took her hand he was self-possessed now and could speak and he had a great deal he wanted to tell her but he said not at all what he had to say how i knew it would be so i never hoped for it and yet in my heart i was always sure he said i believe that it was ordained and i she said even when she stopped and went on again looking at him resolutely with her truthful eyes even when i thrust from me my happiness i always loved you alone but i was carried away i ought to tell you can you forgive that perhaps it was for the best you will have to forgive me so much i ought to tell you this was one of the things he had meant to speak about he had resolved from the first to tell her two things that he was not chaste as she was and that he was not a believer it was agonizing but he considered he ought to tell her both these facts no not now later he said very well later but you must certainly tell me im not afraid of anything i want to know everything now it is settled he added settled that youll take me whatever i may be you wont give me up yes yes yes their conversation was interrupted by mademoiselle linon who with an affected but tender smile came to congratulate her favorite pupil before she had gone the servants came in with their congratulations then relations arrived and there began that state of blissful absurdity from which levin did not emerge till the day after his wedding levin was in a continual state of awkwardness and discomfort but the intensity of his happiness went on all the while increasing he felt continually that a great deal was being expected of him what he did not know and he did everything he was told and it all gave him happiness he had thought his engagement would have nothing about it like others that the ordinary conditions of engaged couples would spoil his special happiness but it ended in his doing exactly as other people did and his happiness being only increased thereby and becoming more and more special more and more unlike anything that had ever happened now
