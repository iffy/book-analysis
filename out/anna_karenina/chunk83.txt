youre not going to get away from us and youre not going to be different but youre going to be the same as youve always been with doubts everlasting dissatisfaction with yourself vain efforts to amend and falls and everlasting expectation of a happiness which you wont get and which isnt possible for you this the things said to him but another voice in his heart was telling him that he must not fall under the sway of the past and that one can do anything with oneself and hearing that voice he went into the corner where stood his two heavy dumbbells and began brandishing them like a gymnast trying to restore his confident temper there was a creak of steps at the door he hastily put down the dumbbells the bailiff came in and said everything thank god was doing well but informed him that the buckwheat in the new drying machine had been a little scorched this piece of news irritated levin the new drying machine had been constructed and partly invented by levin the bailiff had always been against the drying machine and now it was with suppressed triumph that he announced that the buckwheat had been scorched levin was firmly convinced that if the buckwheat had been scorched it was only because the precautions had not been taken for which he had hundreds of times given orders he was annoyed and reprimanded the bailiff but there had been an important and joyful event pava his best cow an expensive beast bought at a show had calved kouzma give me my sheepskin and you tell them to take a lantern ill come and look at her he said to the bailiff the cowhouse for the more valuable cows was just behind the house walking across the yard passing a snowdrift by the lilac tree he went into the cowhouse there was the warm steamy smell of dung when the frozen door was opened and the cows astonished at the unfamiliar light of the lantern stirred on the fresh straw he caught a glimpse of the broad smooth black and piebald back of hollandka berkoot the bull was lying down with his ring in his lip and seemed about to get up but thought better of it and only gave two snorts as they passed by him pava a perfect beauty huge as a hippopotamus with her back turned to them prevented their seeing the calf as she sniffed her all over levin went into the pen looked pava over and lifted the red and spotted calf onto her long tottering legs pava uneasy began lowing but when levin put the calf close to her she was soothed and sighing heavily began licking her with her rough tongue the calf fumbling poked her nose under her mothers udder and stiffened her
