was any tragedy about it and this is why to my mind love both the sorts of love which you remember plato defines in his banquet served as the test of men some men only understand one sort and some only the other and those who only know the non-platonic love have no need to talk of tragedy in such love there can be no sort of tragedy im much obliged for the gratification my humble respects thats all the tragedy and in platonic love there can be no tragedy because in that love all is clear and pure because at that instant levin recollected his own sins and the inner conflict he had lived through and he added unexpectedly but perhaps you are right very likely i dont know i dont know its this dont you see said stepan arkadyevitch youre very much all of a piece thats your strong point and your failing you have a character thats all of a piece and you want the whole of life to be of a piece too but thats not how it is you despise public official work because you want the reality to be invariably corresponding all the while with the aim and thats not how it is you want a mans work too always to have a defined aim and love and family life always to be undivided and thats not how it is all the variety all the charm all the beauty of life is made up of light and shadow levin sighed and made no reply he was thinking of his own affairs and did not hear oblonsky and suddenly both of them felt that though they were friends though they had been dining and drinking together which should have drawn them closer yet each was thinking only of his own affairs and they had nothing to do with one another oblonsky had more than once experienced this extreme sense of aloofness instead of intimacy coming on after dinner and he knew what to do in such cases bill he called and he went into the next room where he promptly came across an aide-de-camp of his acquaintance and dropped into conversation with him about an actress and her protector and at once in the conversation with the aide-de-camp oblonsky had a sense of relaxation and relief after the conversation with levin which always put him to too great a mental and spiritual strain when the tatar appeared with a bill for twenty-six roubles and odd kopecks besides a tip for himself levin who would another time have been horrified like anyone from the country at his share of fourteen roubles did not notice it paid and set off homewards to dress and go to the shtcherbatskys there to decide his fate chapter the young princess kitty shtcherbatskaya was eighteen
