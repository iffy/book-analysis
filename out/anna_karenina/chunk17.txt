so strange to see this sensible manly face in such a childish plight that oblonsky left off looking at him oh where shall we meet you know i want very much to talk to you said levin oblonsky seemed to ponder ill tell you what lets go to gurins to lunch and there we can talk i am free till three no answered levin after an instants thought i have got to go on somewhere else all right then lets dine together dine together but i have nothing very particular only a few words to say and a question i want to ask you and we can have a talk afterwards well say the few words then at once and well gossip after dinner well its this said levin but its of no importance though his face all at once took an expression of anger from the effort he was making to surmount his shyness what are the shtcherbatskys doing everything as it used to be he said stepan arkadyevitch who had long known that levin was in love with his sister-in-law kitty gave a hardly perceptible smile and his eyes sparkled merrily you said a few words but i cant answer in a few words because excuse me a minute a secretary came in with respectful familiarity and the modest consciousness characteristic of every secretary of superiority to his chief in the knowledge of their business he went up to oblonsky with some papers and began under pretense of asking a question to explain some objection stepan arkadyevitch without hearing him out laid his hand genially on the secretarys sleeve no you do as i told you he said softening his words with a smile and with a brief explanation of his view of the matter he turned away from the papers and said so do it that way if you please zahar nikititch the secretary retired in confusion during the consultation with the secretary levin had completely recovered from his embarrassment he was standing with his elbows on the back of a chair and on his face was a look of ironical attention i dont understand it i dont understand it he said what dont you understand said oblonsky smiling as brightly as ever and picking up a cigarette he expected some queer outburst from levin i dont understand what you are doing said levin shrugging his shoulders how can you do it seriously why not why because theres nothing in it you think so but were overwhelmed with work on paper but there youve a gift for it added levin thats to say you think theres a lack of something in me perhaps so said levin but all the same i admire your grandeur and am proud that ive a friend in such a great person youve not answered my question
