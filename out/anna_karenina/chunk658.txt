and handed him a note of the marks he had gained in school well thats very fair said his father you can go hes thinner and taller and has grown out of being a child into a boy i like that said stepan arkadyevitch do you remember me the boy looked back quickly at his uncle yes mon oncle he answered glancing at his father and again he looked downcast his uncle called him to him and took his hand well and how are you getting on he said wanting to talk to him and not knowing what to say the boy blushing and making no answer cautiously drew his hand away as soon as stepan arkadyevitch let go his hand he glanced doubtfully at his father and like a bird set free he darted out of the room a year had passed since the last time seryozha had seen his mother since then he had heard nothing more of her and in the course of that year he had gone to school and made friends among his schoolfellows the dreams and memories of his mother which had made him ill after seeing her did not occupy his thoughts now when they came back to him he studiously drove them away regarding them as shameful and girlish below the dignity of a boy and a schoolboy he knew that his father and mother were separated by some quarrel he knew that he had to remain with his father and he tried to get used to that idea he disliked seeing his uncle so like his mother for it called up those memories of which he was ashamed he disliked it all the more as from some words he had caught as he waited at the study door and still more from the faces of his father and uncle he guessed that they must have been talking of his mother and to avoid condemning the father with whom he lived and on whom he was dependent and above all to avoid giving way to sentimentality which he considered so degrading seryozha tried not to look at his uncle who had come to disturb his peace of mind and not to think of what he recalled to him but when stepan arkadyevitch going out after him saw him on the stairs and calling to him asked him how he spent his playtime at school seryozha talked more freely to him away from his fathers presence we have a railway now he said in answer to his uncles question its like this do you see two sit on a bench theyre the passengers and one stands up straight on the bench and all are harnessed to it by their arms or by their belts and they run through all the rooms the doors are left open
