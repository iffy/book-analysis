the same age as the girl she got up and taking off her hat took up from a little table an album in which there were photographs of her son at different ages she wanted to compare them and began taking them out of the album she took them all out except one the latest and best photograph in it he was in a white smock sitting astride a chair with frowning eyes and smiling lips it was his best most characteristic expression with her little supple hands her white delicate fingers that moved with a peculiar intensity today she pulled at a corner of the photograph but the photograph had caught somewhere and she could not get it out there was no paper-knife on the table and so pulling out the photograph that was next to her sons it was a photograph of vronsky taken at rome in a round hat and with long hair she used it to push out her sons photograph oh here is he she said glancing at the portrait of vronsky and she suddenly recalled that he was the cause of her present misery she had not once thought of him all the morning but now coming all at once upon that manly noble face so familiar and so dear to her she felt a sudden rush of love for him but where is he how is it he leaves me alone in my misery she thought all at once with a feeling of reproach forgetting she had herself kept from him everything concerning her son she sent to ask him to come to her immediately with a throbbing heart she awaited him rehearsing to herself the words in which she would tell him all and the expressions of love with which he would console her the messenger returned with the answer that he had a visitor with him but that he would come immediately and that he asked whether she would let him bring with him prince yashvin who had just arrived in petersburg hes not coming alone and since dinner yesterday he has not seen me she thought hes not coming so that i could tell him everything but coming with yashvin and all at once a strange idea came to her what if he had ceased to love her and going over the events of the last few days it seemed to her that she saw in everything a confirmation of this terrible idea the fact that he had not dined at home yesterday and the fact that he had insisted on their taking separate sets of rooms in petersburg and that even now he was not coming to her alone as though he were trying to avoid meeting her face to face but he ought to tell me so i must know that
