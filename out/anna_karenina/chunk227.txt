the peasants had been mowing no less than four hours without stopping and it was time for their lunch lunch sir said the old man is it really time thats right lunch then levin gave his scythe to tit and together with the peasants who were crossing the long stretch of mown grass slightly sprinkled with rain to get their bread from the heap of coats he went towards his house only then he suddenly awoke to the fact that he had been wrong about the weather and the rain was drenching his hay the hay will be spoiled he said not a bit of it sir mow in the rain and youll rake in fine weather said the old man levin untied his horse and rode home to his coffee sergey ivanovitch was only just getting up when he had drunk his coffee levin rode back again to the mowing before sergey ivanovitch had had time to dress and come down to the dining-room chapter after lunch levin was not in the same place in the string of mowers as before but stood between the old man who had accosted him jocosely and now invited him to be his neighbor and a young peasant who had only been married in the autumn and who was mowing this summer for the first time the old man holding himself erect moved in front with his feet turned out taking long regular strides and with a precise and regular action which seemed to cost him no more effort than swinging ones arms in walking as though it were in play he laid down the high even row of grass it was as though it were not he but the sharp scythe of itself swishing through the juicy grass behind levin came the lad mishka his pretty boyish face with a twist of fresh grass bound round his hair was all working with effort but whenever anyone looked at him he smiled he would clearly have died sooner than own it was hard work for him levin kept between them in the very heat of the day the mowing did not seem such hard work to him the perspiration with which he was drenched cooled him while the sun that burned his back his head and his arms bare to the elbow gave a vigor and dogged energy to his labor and more and more often now came those moments of unconsciousness when it was possible not to think what one was doing the scythe cut of itself these were happy moments still more delightful were the moments when they reached the stream where the rows ended and the old man rubbed his scythe with the wet thick grass rinsed its blade in the fresh water of the stream ladled out a little in a tin dipper
