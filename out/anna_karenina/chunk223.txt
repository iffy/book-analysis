you its a temporary error and will pass konstantin was silent he felt himself vanquished on all sides but he felt at the same time that what he wanted to say was unintelligible to his brother only he could not make up his mind whether it was unintelligible because he was not capable of expressing his meaning clearly or because his brother would not or could not understand him but he did not pursue the speculation and without replying he fell to musing on a quite different and personal matter sergey ivanovitch wound up the last line untied the horse and they drove off chapter the personal matter that absorbed levin during his conversation with his brother was this once in a previous year he had gone to look at the mowing and being made very angry by the bailiff he had recourse to his favorite means for regaining his temper he took a scythe from a peasant and began mowing he liked the work so much that he had several times tried his hand at mowing since he had cut the whole of the meadow in front of his house and this year ever since the early spring he had cherished a plan for mowing for whole days together with the peasants ever since his brothers arrival he had been in doubt whether to mow or not he was loath to leave his brother alone all day long and he was afraid his brother would laugh at him about it but as he drove into the meadow and recalled the sensations of mowing he came near deciding that he would go mowing after the irritating discussion with his brother he pondered over this intention again i must have physical exercise or my temperll certainly be ruined he thought and he determined he would go mowing however awkward he might feel about it with his brother or the peasants towards evening konstantin levin went to his counting house gave directions as to the work to be done and sent about the village to summon the mowers for the morrow to cut the hay in kalinov meadow the largest and best of his grass lands and send my scythe please to tit for him to set it and bring it round tomorrow i shall maybe do some mowing myself too he said trying not to be embarrassed the bailiff smiled and said yes sir at tea the same evening levin said to his brother i fancy the fine weather will last tomorrow i shall start mowing im so fond of that form of field labor said sergey ivanovitch im awfully fond of it i sometimes mow myself with the peasants and tomorrow i want to try mowing the whole day sergey ivanovitch lifted his head and looked with interest at his brother how do you
