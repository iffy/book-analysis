the man was afraid and turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet and he said who art thou and she answered i am ruth thine handmaid spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid for thou art a near kinsman and he said blessed be thou of the lord my daughter for thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning inasmuch as thou followedst not young men whether poor or rich and now my daughter fear not i will do to thee all that thou requirest for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman and now it is true that i am thy near kinsman howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than i tarry this night and it shall be in the morning that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman well let him do the kinsmans part but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee then will i do the part of a kinsman to thee as the lord liveth lie down until the morning and she lay at his feet until the morning and she rose up before one could know another and he said let it not be known that a woman came into the floor also he said bring the vail that thou hast upon thee and hold it and when she held it he measured six measures of barley and laid it on her and she went into the city and when she came to her mother in law she said who art thou my daughter and she told her all that the man had done to her and she said these six measures of barley gave he me for he said to me go not empty unto thy mother in law then said she sit still my daughter until thou know how the matter will fall for the man will not be in rest until he have finished the thing this day then went boaz up to the gate and sat him down there and behold the kinsman of whom boaz spake came by unto whom he said ho such a one turn aside sit down here and he turned aside and sat down and he took ten men of the elders of the city and said sit ye down here and they sat down and he said unto the kinsman naomi that is come again out of the country of moab selleth a parcel of land which was our brother elimelechs and i thought to advertise thee saying buy it before the inhabitants and before the elders of my people if thou wilt redeem it redeem it but if thou wilt not redeem it then tell me that i may know for there is none to redeem it beside thee and i am after thee and he said i will redeem it then said boaz what day thou buyest the field of the hand of naomi thou must buy it also of ruth the moabitess the wife of the dead to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance and the kinsman said i cannot redeem it for myself lest i mar mine own inheritance redeem thou my right to thyself for i cannot redeem it now this was the manner in former time in israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing for to confirm all things a man plucked off his shoe and gave it to his neighbour and this was a testimony in israel therefore the kinsman said unto boaz buy it for thee so he drew off his shoe and boaz said unto the elders and unto all the people ye are witnesses this day that i have bought all that was elimelechs and all that was chilions and mahlons of the hand of naomi moreover ruth the moabitess the wife of mahlon have i purchased to be my wife to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren and from the gate of his place ye are witnesses this day and all the people that were in the gate and the elders said we are witnesses the lord make the woman that is come into thine house like rachel and like leah which two did build the house of israel and do thou worthily in ephratah and be famous in bethlehem and let thy house be like the house of pharez whom tamar bare unto judah of the seed which the lord shall give thee of this young woman so boaz took ruth and she was his wife and when he went in unto her the lord gave her conception and she bare a son and the women said unto naomi blessed be the lord which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman that his name may be famous in israel and he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life and a nourisher of thine old age for thy daughter in law which loveth thee which is better to thee than seven sons hath born him and naomi took the child and laid it in her bosom and became nurse unto it and the women her neighbours gave it a name saying there is a son born to naomi and they called his name obed he is the father of jesse the father of david now these are the generations of pharez pharez begat hezron and hezron begat ram and ram begat amminadab and amminadab begat nahshon and nahshon begat salmon and salmon begat boaz and boaz begat obed and obed begat jesse and jesse begat david the first book of samuel otherwise called the first book of the kings now there was a certain man of ramathaimzophim of mount ephraim and his name was elkanah the son of jeroham the son of elihu the son of tohu the son of zuph an ephrathite and he had two wives the name of the one was hannah and the name of the other peninnah and peninnah had children but hannah had no children and this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the lord of hosts in shiloh and the two sons of eli hophni and phinehas
