syrians be too strong for me then thou shalt help me but if the children of ammon be too strong for thee then i will help thee be of good courage and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people and for the cities of our god and let the lord do that which is good in his sight so joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the syrians unto the battle and they fled before him and when the children of ammon saw that the syrians were fled they likewise fled before abishai his brother and entered into the city then joab came to jerusalem and when the syrians saw that they were put to the worse before israel they sent messengers and drew forth the syrians that were beyond the river and shophach the captain of the host of hadarezer went before them and it was told david and he gathered all israel and passed over jordan and came upon them and set the battle in array against them so when david had put the battle in array against the syrians they fought with him but the syrians fled before israel and david slew of the syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots and forty thousand footmen and killed shophach the captain of the host and when the servants of hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before israel they made peace with david and became his servants neither would the syrians help the children of ammon any more and it came to pass that after the year was expired at the time that kings go out to battle joab led forth the power of the army and wasted the country of the children of ammon and came and besieged rabbah but david tarried at jerusalem and joab smote rabbah and destroyed it and david took the crown of their king from off his head and found it to weigh a talent of gold and there were precious stones in it and it was set upon davids head and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city and he brought out the people that were in it and cut them with saws and with harrows of iron and with axes even so dealt david with all the cities of the children of ammon and david and all the people returned to jerusalem and it came to pass after this that there arose war at gezer with the philistines at which time sibbechai the hushathite slew sippai that was of the children of the giant and they were subdued and there was war again with the philistines and elhanan the son of jair slew lahmi the brother of goliath the gittite whose spear staff was like a weavers beam and yet again there was war at gath where was a man of great stature whose fingers and toes were four and twenty six on each hand and six on each foot and he also was the son of the giant but when he defied israel jonathan the son of shimea davids brother slew him these were born unto the giant in gath and they fell by the hand of david and by the hand of his servants and satan stood up against israel and provoked david to number israel and david said to joab and to the rulers of the people go number israel from beersheba even to dan and bring the number of them to me that i may know it and joab answered the lord make his people an hundred times so many more as they be but my lord the king are they not all my lords servants why then doth my lord require this thing why will he be a cause of trespass to israel nevertheless the kings word prevailed against joab wherefore joab departed and went throughout all israel and came to jerusalem and joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto david and all they of israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword and judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword but levi and benjamin counted he not among them for the kings word was abominable to joab and god was displeased with this thing therefore he smote israel and david said unto god i have sinned greatly because i have done this thing but now i beseech thee do away the iniquity of thy servant for i have done very foolishly and the lord spake unto gad davids seer saying go and tell david saying thus saith the lord i offer thee three things choose thee one of them that i may do it unto thee so gad came to david and said unto him thus saith the lord choose thee either three years famine or three months to be destroyed before thy foes while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee or else three days the sword of the lord even the pestilence in the land and the angel of the lord destroying throughout all the coasts of israel now therefore advise thyself what word i shall bring again to him that sent me and david said unto gad i am in a great strait let me fall now into the hand of the lord for very great are his mercies but let me not fall into the hand of man so the lord sent pestilence upon israel and there fell of israel seventy thousand men and god sent an angel unto jerusalem to destroy it and as he was destroying the lord beheld and he repented him of the evil and said to the angel that destroyed it is enough stay now thine hand and the angel of the lord stood by the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite and david lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of the lord stand between the earth and the heaven having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over jerusalem then david and the elders of israel who were clothed in sackcloth fell upon their faces and david said unto god is it not i that commanded the people to be numbered even i it is that have sinned and done evil indeed but as for these sheep what have they done let thine hand
