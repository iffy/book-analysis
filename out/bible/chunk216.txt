that uriahs wife bare unto david and it was very sick david therefore besought god for the child and david fasted and went in and lay all night upon the earth and the elders of his house arose and went to him to raise him up from the earth but he would not neither did he eat bread with them and it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died and the servants of david feared to tell him that the child was dead for they said behold while the child was yet alive we spake unto him and he would not hearken unto our voice how will he then vex himself if we tell him that the child is dead but when david saw that his servants whispered david perceived that the child was dead therefore david said unto his servants is the child dead and they said he is dead then david arose from the earth and washed and anointed himself and changed his apparel and came into the house of the lord and worshipped then he came to his own house and when he required they set bread before him and he did eat then said his servants unto him what thing is this that thou hast done thou didst fast and weep for the child while it was alive but when the child was dead thou didst rise and eat bread and he said while the child was yet alive i fasted and wept for i said who can tell whether god will be gracious to me that the child may live but now he is dead wherefore should i fast can i bring him back again i shall go to him but he shall not return to me and david comforted bathsheba his wife and went in unto her and lay with her and she bare a son and he called his name solomon and the lord loved him and he sent by the hand of nathan the prophet and he called his name jedidiah because of the lord and joab fought against rabbah of the children of ammon and took the royal city and joab sent messengers to david and said i have fought against rabbah and have taken the city of waters now therefore gather the rest of the people together and encamp against the city and take it lest i take the city and it be called after my name and david gathered all the people together and went to rabbah and fought against it and took it and he took their kings crown from off his head the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones and it was set on davids head and he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance and he brought forth the people that were therein and put them under saws and under harrows of iron and under axes of iron and made them pass through the brick-kiln and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of ammon so david and all the people returned unto jerusalem and it came to pass after this that absalom the son of david had a fair sister whose name was tamar and amnon the son of david loved her and amnon was so vexed that he fell sick for his sister tamar for she was a virgin and amnon thought it hard for him to do anything to her but amnon had a friend whose name was jonadab the son of shimeah davids brother and jonadab was a very subtil man and he said unto him why art thou being the kings son lean from day to day wilt thou not tell me and amnon said unto him i love tamar my brother absaloms sister and jonadab said unto him lay thee down on thy bed and make thyself sick and when thy father cometh to see thee say unto him i pray thee let my sister tamar come and give me meat and dress the meat in my sight that i may see it and eat it at her hand so amnon lay down and made himself sick and when the king was come to see him amnon said unto the king i pray thee let tamar my sister come and make me a couple of cakes in my sight that i may eat at her hand then david sent home to tamar saying go now to thy brother amnons house and dress him meat so tamar went to her brother amnons house and he was laid down and she took flour and kneaded it and made cakes in his sight and did bake the cakes and she took a pan and poured them out before him but he refused to eat and amnon said have out all men from me and they went out every man from him and amnon said unto tamar bring the meat into the chamber that i may eat of thine hand and tamar took the cakes which she had made and brought them into the chamber to amnon her brother and when she had brought them unto him to eat he took hold of her and said unto her come lie with me my sister and she answered him nay my brother do not force me for no such thing ought to be done in israel do not thou this folly and i whither shall i cause my shame to go and as for thee thou shalt be as one of the fools in israel now therefore i pray thee speak unto the king for he will not withhold me from thee howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice but being stronger than she forced her and lay with her then amnon hated her exceedingly so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her and amnon said unto her arise be gone and she said unto him there is no cause this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me but he would not hearken unto her then he called his servant that ministered unto him and said put now this woman out from me and bolt the door after her and she had a garment of divers colours upon her
