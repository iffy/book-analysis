of tears and givest them tears to drink in great measure thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours and our enemies laugh among themselves turn us again o god of hosts and cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved thou hast brought a vine out of egypt thou hast cast out the heathen and planted it thou preparedst room before it and didst cause it to take deep root and it filled the land the hills were covered with the shadow of it and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars she sent out her boughs unto the sea and her branches unto the river why hast thou then broken down her hedges so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her the boar out of the wood doth waste it and the wild beast of the field doth devour it return we beseech thee o god of hosts look down from heaven and behold and visit this vine and the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself it is burned with fire it is cut down they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself so will not we go back from thee quicken us and we will call upon thy name turn us again o lord god of hosts cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved sing aloud unto god our strength make a joyful noise unto the god of jacob take a psalm and bring hither the timbrel the pleasant harp with the psaltery blow up the trumpet in the new moon in the time appointed on our solemn feast day for this was a statute for israel and a law of the god of jacob this he ordained in joseph for a testimony when he went out through the land of egypt where i heard a language that i understood not i removed his shoulder from the burden his hands were delivered from the pots thou calledst in trouble and i delivered thee i answered thee in the secret place of thunder i proved thee at the waters of meribah selah hear o my people and i will testify unto thee o israel if thou wilt hearken unto me there shall no strange god be in thee neither shalt thou worship any strange god i am the lord thy god which brought thee out of the land of egypt open thy mouth wide and i will fill it but my people would not hearken to my voice and israel would none of me so i gave them up unto their own hearts lust and they walked in their own counsels oh that my people had hearkened unto me and israel had walked in my ways i should soon have subdued their enemies and turned my hand against their adversaries the haters of the lord should have submitted themselves unto him but their time should have endured for ever he should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat and with honey out of the rock should i have satisfied thee god standeth in the congregation of the mighty he judgeth among the gods how long will ye judge unjustly and accept the persons of the wicked selah defend the poor and fatherless do justice to the afflicted and needy deliver the poor and needy rid them out of the hand of the wicked they know not neither will they understand they walk on in darkness all the foundations of the earth are out of course i have said ye are gods and all of you are children of the most high but ye shall die like men and fall like one of the princes arise o god judge the earth for thou shalt inherit all nations keep not thou silence o god hold not thy peace and be not still o god for lo thine enemies make a tumult and they that hate thee have lifted up the head they have taken crafty counsel against thy people and consulted against thy hidden ones they have said come and let us cut them off from being a nation that the name of israel may be no more in remembrance for they have consulted together with one consent they are confederate against thee the tabernacles of edom and the ishmaelites of moab and the hagarenes gebal and ammon and amalek the philistines with the inhabitants of tyre assur also is joined with them they have holpen the children of lot selah do unto them as unto the midianites as to sisera as to jabin at the brook of kison which perished at endor they became as dung for the earth make their nobles like oreb and like zeeb yea all their princes as zebah and as zalmunna who said let us take to ourselves the houses of god in possession o my god make them like a wheel as the stubble before the wind as the fire burneth a wood and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire so persecute them with thy tempest and make them afraid with thy storm fill their faces with shame that they may seek thy name o lord let them be confounded and troubled for ever yea let them be put to shame and perish that men may know that thou whose name alone is jehovah art the most high over all the earth how amiable are thy tabernacles o lord of hosts my soul longeth yea even fainteth for the courts of the lord my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living god yea the sparrow hath found an house and the swallow a nest for herself where she may lay her young even thine altars o lord of hosts my king and my god blessed are they that dwell in thy house they will be still praising thee selah blessed is the man whose strength is in thee in whose heart are the ways of them who passing through the valley of baca make it a well the rain also filleth the pools they go from strength to strength every one of them in zion appeareth before god o lord god of
