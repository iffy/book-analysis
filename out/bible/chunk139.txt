the presence of the elders and loose his shoe from off his foot and spit in his face and shall answer and say so shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brothers house and his name shall be called in israel the house of him that hath his shoe loosed when men strive together one with another and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him and putteth forth her hand and taketh him by the secrets then thou shalt cut off her hand thine eye shall not pity her thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights a great and a small thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures a great and a small but thou shalt have a perfect and just weight a perfect and just measure shalt thou have that thy days may be lengthened in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee for all that do such things and all that do unrighteously are an abomination unto the lord thy god remember what amalek did unto thee by the way when ye were come forth out of egypt how he met thee by the way and smote the hindmost of thee even all that were feeble behind thee when thou wast faint and weary and he feared not god therefore it shall be when the lord thy god hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven thou shalt not forget it and it shall be when thou art come in unto the land which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance and possessest it and dwellest therein that thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth which thou shalt bring of thy land that the lord thy god giveth thee and shalt put it in a basket and shalt go unto the place which the lord thy god shall choose to place his name there and thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days and say unto him i profess this day unto the lord thy god that i am come unto the country which the lord sware unto our fathers for to give us and the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand and set it down before the altar of the lord thy god and thou shalt speak and say before the lord thy god a syrian ready to perish was my father and he went down into egypt and sojourned there with a few and became there a nation great mighty and populous and the egyptians evil entreated us and afflicted us and laid upon us hard bondage and when we cried unto the lord god of our fathers the lord heard our voice and looked on our affliction and our labour and our oppression and the lord brought us forth out of egypt with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm and with great terribleness and with signs and with wonders and he hath brought us into this place and hath given us this land even a land that floweth with milk and honey and now behold i have brought the firstfruits of the land which thou o lord hast given me and thou shalt set it before the lord thy god and worship before the lord thy god and thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the lord thy god hath given unto thee and unto thine house thou and the levite and the stranger that is among you when thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine increase the third year which is the year of tithing and hast given it unto the levite the stranger the fatherless and the widow that they may eat within thy gates and be filled then thou shalt say before the lord thy god i have brought away the hallowed things out of mine house and also have given them unto the levite and unto the stranger to the fatherless and to the widow according to all thy commandments which thou hast commanded me i have not transgressed thy commandments neither have i forgotten them i have not eaten thereof in my mourning neither have i taken away ought thereof for any unclean use nor given ought thereof for the dead but i have hearkened to the voice of the lord my god and have done according to all that thou hast commanded me look down from thy holy habitation from heaven and bless thy people israel and the land which thou hast given us as thou swarest unto our fathers a land that floweth with milk and honey this day the lord thy god hath commanded thee to do these statutes and judgments thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thine heart and with all thy soul thou hast avouched the lord this day to be thy god and to walk in his ways and to keep his statutes and his commandments and his judgments and to hearken unto his voice and the lord hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people as he hath promised thee and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments and to make thee high above all nations which he hath made in praise and in name and in honour and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the lord thy god as he hath spoken and moses with the elders of israel commanded the people saying keep all the commandments which i command you this day and it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over jordan unto the land which the lord thy god giveth thee that thou shalt set thee up great stones and plaister them with plaister and thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law when thou art passed over that thou mayest go in unto the land which the lord thy god giveth thee a land that floweth with milk and honey as the lord god of thy fathers hath promised thee therefore it shall be when
