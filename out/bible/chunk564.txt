i come and i will dwell in the midst of thee saith the lord and many nations shall be joined to the lord in that day and shall be my people and i will dwell in the midst of thee and thou shalt know that the lord of hosts hath sent me unto thee and the lord shall inherit judah his portion in the holy land and shall choose jerusalem again be silent o all flesh before the lord for he is raised up out of his holy habitation and he shewed me joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the lord and satan standing at his right hand to resist him and the lord said unto satan the lord rebuke thee o satan even the lord that hath chosen jerusalem rebuke thee is not this a brand plucked out of the fire now joshua was clothed with filthy garments and stood before the angel and he answered and spake unto those that stood before him saying take away the filthy garments from him and unto him he said behold i have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee and i will clothe thee with change of raiment and i said let them set a fair mitre upon his head so they set a fair mitre upon his head and clothed him with garments and the angel of the lord stood by and the angel of the lord protested unto joshua saying thus saith the lord of hosts if thou wilt walk in my ways and if thou wilt keep my charge then thou shalt also judge my house and shalt also keep my courts and i will give thee places to walk among these that stand by hear now o joshua the high priest thou and thy fellows that sit before thee for they are men wondered at for behold i will bring forth my servant the branch for behold the stone that i have laid before joshua upon one stone shall be seven eyes behold i will engrave the graving thereof saith the lord of hosts and i will remove the iniquity of that land in one day in that day saith the lord of hosts shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree and the angel that talked with me came again and waked me as a man that is wakened out of his sleep and said unto me what seest thou and i said i have looked and behold a candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof so i answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and i said no my lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the lord unto zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts who art thou o great mountain before zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace unto it moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying the hands of zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the lord of hosts hath sent me unto you for who hath despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubbabel with those seven they are the eyes of the lord which run to and fro through the whole earth then answered i and said unto him what are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof and i answered again and said unto him what be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves and he answered me and said knowest thou not what these be and i said no my lord then said he these are the two anointed ones that stand by the lord of the whole earth then i turned and lifted up mine eyes and looked and behold a flying roll and he said unto me what seest thou and i answered i see a flying roll the length thereof is twenty cubits and the breadth thereof ten cubits then said he unto me this is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth for every one that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side according to it and every one that sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according to it i will bring it forth saith the lord of hosts and it shall enter into the house of the thief and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name and it shall remain in the midst of his house and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof then the angel that talked with me went forth and said unto me lift up now thine eyes and see what is this that goeth forth and i said what is it and he said this is an ephah that goeth forth he said moreover this is their resemblance through all the earth and behold there was lifted up a talent of lead and this is a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah and he said this is wickedness and he cast it into the midst of the ephah and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof then lifted i up mine eyes and looked and behold there came out two women and the wind was in their wings for they had wings like the wings of a stork and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven then said i to the angel that talked with me whither do these bear the ephah and he said unto me to build
