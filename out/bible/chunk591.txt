staves for to take me i sat daily with you teaching in the temple and ye laid no hold on me but all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled then all the disciples forsook him and fled and they that had laid hold on jesus led him away to caiaphas the high priest where the scribes and the elders were assembled but peter followed him afar off unto the high priests palace and went in and sat with the servants to see the end now the chief priests and elders and all the council sought false witness against jesus to put him to death but found none yea though many false witnesses came yet found they none at the last came two false witnesses and said this fellow said i am able to destroy the temple of god and to build it in three days and the high priest arose and said unto him answerest thou nothing what is it which these witness against thee but jesus held his peace and the high priest answered and said unto him i adjure thee by the living god that thou tell us whether thou be the christ the son of god jesus saith unto him thou hast said nevertheless i say unto you hereafter shall ye see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven then the high priest rent his clothes saying he hath spoken blasphemy what further need have we of witnesses behold now ye have heard his blasphemy what think ye they answered and said he is guilty of death then did they spit in his face and buffeted him and others smote him with the palms of their hands saying prophesy unto us thou christ who is he that smote thee now peter sat without in the palace and a damsel came unto him saying thou also wast with jesus of galilee but he denied before them all saying i know not what thou sayest and when he was gone out into the porch another maid saw him and said unto them that were there this fellow was also with jesus of nazareth and again he denied with an oath i do not know the man and after a while came unto him they that stood by and said to peter surely thou also art one of them for thy speech bewrayeth thee then began he to curse and to swear saying i know not the man and immediately the cock crew and peter remembered the word of jesus which said unto him before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice and he went out and wept bitterly when the morning was come all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against jesus to put him to death and when they had bound him they led him away and delivered him to pontius pilate the governor then judas which had betrayed him when he saw that he was condemned repented himself and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders saying i have sinned in that i have betrayed the innocent blood and they said what is that to us see thou to that and he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed and went and hanged himself and the chief priests took the silver pieces and said it is not lawful for to put them into the treasury because it is the price of blood and they took counsel and bought with them the potters field to bury strangers in wherefore that field was called the field of blood unto this day then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet saying and they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of him that was valued whom they of the children of israel did value and gave them for the potters field as the lord appointed me and jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked him saying art thou the king of the jews and jesus said unto him thou sayest and when he was accused of the chief priests and elders he answered nothing then said pilate unto him hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee and he answered him to never a word insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner whom they would and they had then a notable prisoner called barabbas therefore when they were gathered together pilate said unto them whom will ye that i release unto you barabbas or jesus which is called christ for he knew that for envy they had delivered him when he was set down on the judgment seat his wife sent unto him saying have thou nothing to do with that just man for i have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him but the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask barabbas and destroy jesus the governor answered and said unto them whether of the twain will ye that i release unto you they said barabbas pilate saith unto them what shall i do then with jesus which is called christ they all say unto him let him be crucified and the governor said why what evil hath he done but they cried out the more saying let him be crucified when pilate saw that he could prevail nothing but that rather a tumult was made he took water and washed his hands before the multitude saying i am innocent of the blood of this just person see ye to it then answered all the people and said his blood be on us and on our children then released he barabbas unto them and when he had scourged jesus he delivered him to be crucified then the soldiers of the governor took jesus into the common hall and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers and they stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe and when they had platted a crown of thorns they put it upon his head and a reed in his right hand and they bowed the knee before him and mocked him saying hail king of the jews
