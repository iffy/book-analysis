is it therefore not of the body and if the ear shall say because i am not the eye i am not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the whole body were an eye where were the hearing if the whole were hearing where were the smelling but now hath god set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him and if they were all one member where were the body but now are they many members yet but one body and the eye cannot say unto the hand i have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet i have no need of you nay much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary and those members of the body which we think to be less honourable upon these we bestow more abundant honour and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness for our comely parts have no need but god hath tempered the body together having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked that there should be no schism in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another and whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honoured all the members rejoice with it now ye are the body of christ and members in particular and god hath set some in the church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers after that miracles then gifts of healings helps governments diversities of tongues are all apostles are all prophets are all teachers are all workers of miracles have all the gifts of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret but covet earnestly the best gifts and yet shew i unto you a more excellent way though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity i am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up doth not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that ye may prophesy for he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men but unto god for no man understandeth him howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries but he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification and exhortation and comfort he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself but he that prophesieth edifieth the church i would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues except he interpret that the church may receive edifying now brethren if i come unto you speaking with tongues what shall i profit you except i shall speak to you either by revelation or by knowledge or by prophesying or by doctrine and even things without life giving sound whether pipe or harp except they give a distinction in the sounds how shall it be known what is piped or harped for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle so likewise ye except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood how shall it be known what is spoken for ye shall speak into the air there are it may be so many kinds of voices in the world and none of them is without signification therefore if i know not the meaning of the voice i shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me even so ye forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret for if i pray in an unknown tongue my spirit prayeth but my understanding is unfruitful what is it then i will pray with the spirit and i will pray with the understanding also i will sing with the spirit and i will sing with the understanding also else when thou shalt bless with the spirit how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say amen at thy giving of thanks seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest for thou verily givest thanks well but the other is not edified i thank my god i speak with tongues more than ye all yet in the church i had rather speak five words with my understanding that by my voice i might teach others also than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue brethren be not children in understanding howbeit in malice be ye children but in understanding be men in the law it is written with men of other tongues and other lips will i speak unto this people and yet for all that will they not hear me saith the lord wherefore tongues are for a sign not to them
