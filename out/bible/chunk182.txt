lord and behold there came none to the camp from jabeshgilead to the assembly for the people were numbered and behold there were none of the inhabitants of jabeshgilead there and the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest and commanded them saying go and smite the inhabitants of jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword with the women and the children and this is the thing that ye shall do ye shall utterly destroy every male and every woman that hath lain by man and they found among the inhabitants of jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins that had known no man by lying with any male and they brought them unto the camp to shiloh which is in the land of canaan and the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of benjamin that were in the rock rimmon and to call peaceably unto them and benjamin came again at that time and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of jabeshgilead and yet so they sufficed them not and the people repented them for benjamin because that the lord had made a breach in the tribes of israel then the elders of the congregation said how shall we do for wives for them that remain seeing the women are destroyed out of benjamin and they said there must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of benjamin that a tribe be not destroyed out of israel howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters for the children of israel have sworn saying cursed be he that giveth a wife to benjamin then they said behold there is a feast of the lord in shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of bethel on the east side of the highway that goeth up from bethel to shechem and on the south of lebonah therefore they commanded the children of benjamin saying go and lie in wait in the vineyards and see and behold if the daughters of shiloh come out to dance in dances then come ye out of the vineyards and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of shiloh and go to the land of benjamin and it shall be when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain that we will say unto them be favourable unto them for our sakes because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war for ye did not give unto them at this time that ye should be guilty and the children of benjamin did so and took them wives according to their number of them that danced whom they caught and they went and returned unto their inheritance and repaired the cities and dwelt in them and the children of israel departed thence at that time every man to his tribe and to his family and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance in those days there was no king in israel every man did that which was right in his own eyes the book of ruth now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land and a certain man of bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of moab he and his wife and his two sons and the name of the man was elimelech and the name of his wife naomi and the name of his two sons mahlon and chilion ephrathites of bethlehemjudah and they came into the country of moab and continued there and elimelech naomis husband died and she was left and her two sons and they took them wives of the women of moab the name of the one was orpah and the name of the other ruth and they dwelled there about ten years and mahlon and chilion died also both of them and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband then she arose with her daughters in law that she might return from the country of moab for she had heard in the country of moab how that the lord had visited his people in giving them bread wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was and her two daughters in law with her and they went on the way to return unto the land of judah and naomi said unto her two daughters in law go return each to her mothers house the lord deal kindly with you as ye have dealt with the dead and with me the lord grant you that ye may find rest each of you in the house of her husband then she kissed them and they lifted up their voice and wept and they said unto her surely we will return with thee unto thy people and naomi said turn again my daughters why will ye go with me are there yet any more sons in my womb that they may be your husbands turn again my daughters go your way for i am too old to have an husband if i should say i have hope if i should have an husband also to night and should also bear sons would ye tarry for them till they were grown would ye stay for them from having husbands nay my daughters for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the lord is gone out against me and they lifted up their voice and wept again and orpah kissed her mother in law but ruth clave unto her and she said behold thy sister in law is gone back unto her people and unto her gods return thou after thy sister in law and ruth said intreat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for whither thou goest i will go and where thou lodgest i will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy god my god where thou diest will i die and there will i be buried the lord do so to me and more also if ought but death part thee and me when she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her then she left speaking unto her so they two went until they came to bethlehem and it came to pass
