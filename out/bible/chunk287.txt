joel three the sons of shimei shelomith and haziel and haran three these were the chief of the fathers of laadan and the sons of shimei were jahath zina and jeush and beriah these four were the sons of shimei and jahath was the chief and zizah the second but jeush and beriah had not many sons therefore they were in one reckoning according to their fathers house the sons of kohath amram izhar hebron and uzziel four the sons of amram aaron and moses and aaron was separated that he should sanctify the most holy things he and his sons for ever to burn incense before the lord to minister unto

and eleazar died and had no sons but daughters and their brethren the sons of kish took them the sons of mushi mahli and eder and jeremoth three these were the sons of levi after the house of their fathers even the chief of the fathers as they were counted by number of names by their polls that did the work for the service of the house of the lord from the age of twenty years and upward for david said the lord god of israel hath given rest unto his people that they may dwell in jerusalem for ever and also unto the levites they shall no more carry the tabernacle nor any vessels of it for the service thereof for by the last words of david the levites were numbered from twenty years old and above because their office was to wait on the sons of aaron for the service of the house of the lord in the courts and in the chambers and in the purifying of all holy things and the work of the service of the house of god both for the shewbread and for the fine flour for meat offering and for the unleavened cakes and for that which is baked in the pan and for that which is fried and for all manner of measure and size and to stand every morning to thank and praise the lord and likewise at even and to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the lord in the sabbaths in the new moons and on the set feasts by number according to the order commanded unto them continually before the lord and that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation and the charge of the holy place and the charge of the sons of aaron their brethren in the service of the house of the lord now these are the divisions of the sons of aaron the sons of aaron nadab and abihu eleazar and ithamar but nadab and abihu died before their father and had no children therefore eleazar and ithamar executed the priests office and david distributed them both zadok of the sons of eleazar and ahimelech of the sons of ithamar according to their offices in their service and there were more chief men found of the sons of eleazar than of the sons of ithamar and thus were they divided among the sons of eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers and eight among the sons of ithamar according to the house of their fathers thus were they divided by lot one sort with another for the governors of the sanctuary and governors of the house of god were of the sons of eleazar and of the sons of ithamar and shemaiah the son of nethaneel the scribe one of the levites wrote them before the king and the princes and zadok the priest and ahimelech the son of abiathar and before the chief of the fathers of the priests and levites one principal household being taken for eleazar and one taken for ithamar now the first lot came forth to jehoiarib the second to jedaiah the third to harim
