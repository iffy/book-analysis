do not ye serve my gods nor worship the golden image which i have set up now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery and dulcimer and all kinds of musick ye fall down and worship the image which i have made well but if ye worship not ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace and who is that god that shall deliver you out of my hands shadrach meshach and abednego answered and said to the king o nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter if it be so our god whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand o king but if not be it known unto thee o king that we will not serve thy gods nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up then was nebuchadnezzar full of fury and the form of his visage was changed against shadrach meshach and abednego therefore he spake and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated and he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind shadrach meshach and abednego and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace then these men were bound in their coats their hosen and their hats and their other garments and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace therefore because the kings commandment was urgent and the furnace exceeding hot the flames of the fire slew those men that took up shadrach meshach and abednego and these three men shadrach meshach and abednego fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace then nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied and rose up in haste and spake and said unto his counsellors did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire they answered and said unto the king true o king he answered and said lo i see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt and the form of the fourth is like the son of god then nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace and spake and said shadrach meshach and abednego ye servants of the most high god come forth and come hither then shadrach meshach and abednego came forth of the midst of the fire and the princes governors and captains and the kings counsellors being gathered together saw these men upon whose bodies the fire had no power nor was an hair of their head singed neither were their coats changed nor the smell of fire had passed on them then nebuchadnezzar spake and said blessed be the god of shadrach meshach and abednego who hath sent his angel and delivered his servants that trusted in him and have changed the kings word and yielded their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any god except their own god therefore i make a decree that every people nation and language which speak any thing amiss against the god of shadrach meshach and abednego shall be cut in pieces and their houses shall be made a dunghill because there is no other god that can deliver after this sort then the king promoted shadrach meshach and abednego in the province of babylon nebuchadnezzar the king unto all people nations and languages that dwell in all the earth peace be multiplied unto you i thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high god hath wrought toward me how great are his signs and how mighty are his wonders his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and his dominion is from generation to generation i nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house and flourishing in my palace i saw a dream which made me afraid and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me therefore made i a decree to bring in all the wise men of babylon before me that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream then came in the magicians the astrologers the chaldeans and the soothsayers and i told the dream before them but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof but at the last daniel came in before me whose name was belteshazzar according to the name of my god and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods and before him i told the dream saying o belteshazzar master of the magicians because i know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee and no secret troubleth thee tell me the visions of my dream that i have seen and the interpretation thereof thus were the visions of mine head in my bed i saw and behold a tree in the midst of the earth and the height thereof was great the tree grew and was strong and the height thereof reached unto heaven and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth the leaves thereof were fair and the fruit thereof much and in it was meat for all the beasts of the field had shadow under it and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof and all flesh was fed of it i saw in the visions of my head upon my bed and behold a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven he cried aloud and said thus hew down the tree and cut off his branches shake off his leaves and scatter his fruit let the beasts get away from under it and the fowls from his branches nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth even with a band of iron and brass in the tender grass of the field and let it be wet with the dew of heaven and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth let his heart be changed from mans and let a beasts heart be given unto him and let seven times pass over him this matter is by the decree of the watchers and the demand by the word of the holy ones to
