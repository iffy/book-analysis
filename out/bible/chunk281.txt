kingdom of saul to him according to the word of the lord the children of judah that bare shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred ready armed to the war of the children of simeon mighty

them had kept the ward of the house of saul and of the children of ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred mighty men of valour famous throughout the house of their fathers and of the half tribe of manasseh eighteen thousand which were expressed by name to come and make david king and of the children of issachar which were men that had understanding of the times to know what israel ought to do the heads of them were two hundred and all their brethren were at their commandment of zebulun such as went forth to battle expert in war with all instruments of war fifty thousand which could keep rank they were not of double heart and of naphtali a thousand captains and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand and of the danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six

of israel were of one heart to make david king and there they were with david three days eating and drinking for their brethren had prepared for them moreover they that were nigh them even unto issachar and zebulun and naphtali brought bread on asses and on camels and on mules and on oxen and meat meal cakes of figs and bunches of raisins and wine and oil and oxen and sheep abundantly for there was joy in israel and david consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds and with every leader and david said unto all the congregation of israel if it seem good unto you and that it be of the lord our god let us send abroad unto our brethren every where that are left in all the land of israel and with them also to the priests and levites which are in their cities and suburbs that they may gather themselves unto us and let us bring again the ark of our god to us for we enquired not at it in the days of saul and all the congregation said that they would do so for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people so david gathered all israel together from shihor of egypt even unto the entering of hemath to bring the ark of god from kirjathjearim and david went up and all israel to baalah that is to kirjathjearim which belonged to judah to bring up thence the ark of god the lord that dwelleth between the cherubims whose name is called on it and they carried the ark of god in a new cart out of the house of abinadab and uzza and ahio drave the cart and david and all israel played before god with all their might and with singing and with harps and with psalteries and with timbrels and with cymbals and with trumpets and when they came unto the threshingfloor of chidon uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark for the oxen stumbled and the anger of the lord was kindled against uzza and he smote him because he put his hand to the ark and there he died before god and david was displeased because the lord had made a breach upon uzza wherefore that place is called perezuzza to this day and david was afraid of god that day saying how shall i bring the ark of god home to me so david brought not the ark home to himself to the city of david but carried it aside into the house of obededom the gittite and the ark of god remained with the family of obededom in his house three months and the lord blessed the house of obededom and all that he had now hiram king of tyre sent messengers to david and timber of cedars with masons and carpenters to build him an house and david perceived that the lord had confirmed him king over israel for his kingdom was lifted up on high because of his people israel and david took more wives at jerusalem and david begat more sons and daughters now these are the names of his children which he had in jerusalem shammua and shobab nathan and solomon and ibhar and elishua and elpalet and nogah and nepheg and japhia and elishama and beeliada and eliphalet and when the philistines heard that david was anointed king over all israel all the philistines went up to seek david and david heard of it and went out against them and the philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of rephaim and david enquired of god saying shall i go up against the philistines and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand and the lord said unto him go up for i will deliver them into thine hand so they came up to baalperazim and david smote them there then david said god hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters therefore they called the name of that place baalperazim and when they had left their gods there david gave a commandment and they were burned with fire and the philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley therefore david enquired again of god and god said unto him go not up after them turn away from them and
