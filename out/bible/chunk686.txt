evil spoken of for that for which i give thanks whether therefore ye eat or drink or whatsoever ye do do all to the glory of god give none offence neither to the jews nor to the gentiles nor to the church of god even as i please all men in all things not seeking mine own profit but the profit of many that they may be saved be ye followers of me even as i also am of christ now i praise you brethren that ye remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as i delivered them to you but i would have you know that the head of every man is christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of christ is god every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonoureth his head but every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head for that is even all one as if she were shaven for if the woman be not covered let her also be shorn but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven let her be covered for a man indeed ought not to cover his head forasmuch as he is the image and glory of god but the woman is the glory of the man for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man neither was the man created for the woman but the woman for the man for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels nevertheless neither is the man without the woman neither the woman without the man in the lord for as the woman is of the man even so is the man also by the woman but all things of god judge in yourselves is it comely that a woman pray unto god uncovered doth not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering but if any man seem to be contentious we have no such custom neither the churches of god now in this that i declare unto you i praise you not that ye come together not for the better but for the worse for first of all when ye come together in the church i hear that there be divisions among you and i partly believe it for there must be also heresies among you that they which are approved may be made manifest among you when ye come together therefore into one place this is not to eat the lords supper for in eating every one taketh before other his own supper and one is hungry and another is drunken what have ye not houses to eat and to drink in or despise ye the church of god and shame them that have not what shall i say to you shall i praise you in this i praise you not for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do shew the lords death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lords body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when ye come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation and the rest will i set in order when i come now concerning spiritual gifts brethren i would not have you ignorant ye know that ye were gentiles carried away unto these dumb idols even as ye were led wherefore i give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of god calleth jesus accursed and that no man can say that jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit and there are differences of administrations but the same lord and there are diversities of operations but it is the same god which worketh all in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit withal for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit to another faith by the same spirit to another the gifts of healing by the same spirit to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another divers kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues but all these worketh that one and the selfsame spirit dividing to every man severally as he will for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is christ for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many if the foot shall say because i am not the hand i am not of the body
