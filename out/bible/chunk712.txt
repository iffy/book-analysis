shewing all good fidelity that they may adorn the doctrine of god our saviour in all things for the grace of god that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and our saviour jesus christ who gave

men for we ourselves also were sometimes foolish disobedient deceived serving divers lusts and pleasures living in malice and envy hateful and hating one another but after that the kindness and love of god our saviour toward man appeared not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy ghost which he

in my prayers hearing of thy love and faith which thou hast toward the lord jesus and toward all saints that the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good
