places of the villages in the secret places doth he murder the innocent his eyes are privily set against the poor he lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den he lieth in wait to catch the poor he doth catch the poor when he draweth him into his net he croucheth and humbleth himself that the poor may fall by his strong ones he hath said in his heart god hath forgotten he hideth his face he will never see it arise o lord o god lift up thine hand forget not the humble wherefore doth the wicked contemn god he hath said in his heart thou wilt not require it thou hast seen it for thou beholdest

hear to judge the fatherless and the oppressed that the man of the earth may no more oppress in the lord put i my trust how say ye to my soul flee as a bird to your mountain for lo the wicked bend their bow they make ready their arrow upon the string that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart if the foundations be destroyed what can the righteous do the lord is in his holy temple the lords throne is in heaven his eyes behold his eyelids try the children of men the lord trieth the righteous but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth upon the wicked he shall rain

flattering lips and the tongue that speaketh proud things who have said with our tongue will we prevail our lips are our own who is lord over us for the oppression of the poor for the sighing of the needy now will i arise saith the lord i will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him the words of the lord are pure words as silver tried in a furnace of earth purified seven times thou shalt keep them o lord thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever the wicked walk on every side when the vilest men are exalted how long wilt thou forget me o lord for ever how long wilt thou hide thy face from me how long shall i take counsel in my soul having sorrow in my heart daily how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me consider and hear me o lord my god lighten mine eyes lest i sleep the sleep of death lest mine enemy say i have prevailed against him and those that trouble me rejoice when i am moved but i have trusted in thy mercy my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation i will sing unto the lord because he hath dealt bountifully with me the fool hath said in his heart there is no god they are corrupt they have done abominable works there is none that doeth good the lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand and seek god they are all gone aside they are all together become filthy there is none that doeth good no not one have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge who eat up my people as they eat bread and call not upon the lord there were they in great fear for god is in the generation of the
