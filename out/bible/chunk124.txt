unto him a people of inheritance as ye are this day furthermore the lord was angry with me for your sakes and sware that i should not go over jordan and that i should not go in unto that good land which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance but i must die in this land i must not go over jordan but ye shall go over and possess that good land take heed unto yourselves lest ye forget the covenant of the lord your god which he made with you and make you a graven image or the likeness of any thing which the lord thy god hath forbidden thee for the lord thy god is a consuming fire even a jealous god when thou shalt beget children and childrens children and ye shall have remained long in the land and shall corrupt yourselves and make a graven image or the likeness of any thing and shall do evil in the sight of the lord thy god to provoke him to anger i call heaven and earth to witness against you this day that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over jordan to possess it ye shall not prolong your days upon it but shall utterly be destroyed and the lord shall scatter you among the nations and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen whither the lord shall lead you and there ye shall serve gods the work of mens hands wood and stone which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell but if from thence thou shalt seek the lord thy god thou shalt find him if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul when thou art in tribulation and all these things are come upon thee even in the latter days if thou turn to the lord thy god and shalt be obedient unto his voice for the lord thy god is a merciful god he will not forsake thee neither destroy thee nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them for ask now of the days that are past which were before thee since the day that god created man upon the earth and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is or hath been heard like it did ever people hear the voice of god speaking out of the midst of the fire as thou hast heard and live or hath god assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation by temptations by signs and by wonders and by war and by a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm and by great terrors according to all that the lord your god did for you in egypt before your eyes unto thee it was shewed that thou mightest know that the lord he is god there is none else beside him out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice that he might instruct thee and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire and because he loved thy fathers therefore he chose their seed after them and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of egypt to drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou art to bring thee in to give thee their land for an inheritance as it is this day know therefore this day and consider it in thine heart that the lord he is god in heaven above and upon the earth beneath there is none else thou shalt keep therefore his statutes and his commandments which i command thee this day that it may go well with thee and with thy children after thee and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth which the lord thy god giveth thee for ever then moses severed three cities on this side jordan toward the sunrising that the slayer might flee thither which should kill his neighbour unawares and hated him not in times past and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live namely bezer in the wilderness in the plain country of the reubenites and ramoth in gilead of the gadites and golan in bashan of the manassites and this is the law which moses set before the children of israel these are the testimonies and the statutes and the judgments which moses spake unto the children of israel after they came forth out of egypt on this side jordan in the valley over against bethpeor in the land of sihon king of the amorites who dwelt at heshbon whom moses and the children of israel smote after they were come forth out of egypt and they possessed his land and the land of og king of bashan two kings of the amorites which were on this side jordan toward the sunrising from aroer which is by the bank of the river arnon even unto mount sion which is hermon and all the plain on this side jordan eastward even unto the sea of the plain under the springs of pisgah and moses called all israel and said unto them hear o israel the statutes and judgments which i speak in your ears this day that ye may learn them and keep and do them the lord our god made a covenant with us in horeb the lord made not this covenant with our fathers but with us even us who are all of us here alive this day the lord talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire i stood between the lord and you at that time to shew you the word of the lord for ye were afraid by reason of the fire and went not up into the mount saying i am the lord thy god which brought thee out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage thou shalt have none other gods before me thou shalt not make thee any graven image or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the
