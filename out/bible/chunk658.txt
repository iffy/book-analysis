the city of joppa praying and in a trance i saw a vision a certain vessel descend as it had been a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners and it came even to me upon the which when i had fastened mine eyes i considered and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and fowls of the air and i heard a voice saying unto me arise peter slay and eat but i said not so lord for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth but the voice answered me again from heaven what god hath cleansed that call not thou common and this was done three times and all were drawn up again into heaven and behold immediately there were three men already come unto the house where i was sent from caesarea unto me and the spirit bade me go with them nothing doubting moreover these six brethren accompanied me and we entered into the mans house and he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house which stood and said unto him send men to joppa and call for simon whose surname is peter who shall tell thee words whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved and as i began to speak the holy ghost fell on them as on us at the beginning then remembered i the word of the lord how that he said john indeed baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost forasmuch then as god gave them the like gift as he did unto us who believed on the lord jesus christ what was i that i could withstand god when they heard these things they held their peace and glorified god saying then hath god also to the gentiles granted repentance unto life now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about stephen travelled as far as phenice and cyprus and antioch preaching the word to none but unto the jews only and some of them were men of cyprus and cyrene which when they were come to antioch spake unto the grecians preaching the lord jesus and the hand of the lord was with them and a great number believed and turned unto the lord then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in jerusalem and they sent forth barnabas that he should go as far as antioch who when he came and had seen the grace of god was glad and exhorted them all that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the lord for he was a good man and full of the holy ghost and of faith and much people was added unto the lord then departed barnabas to tarsus for to seek saul and when he had found him he brought him unto antioch and it came to pass that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church and taught much people and the disciples were called christians first in antioch and in these days came prophets from jerusalem unto antioch and there stood up one of them named agabus and signified by the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world which came to pass in the days of claudius caesar then the disciples every man according to his ability determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in judaea which also they did and sent it to the elders by the hands of barnabas and saul now about that time herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church and he killed james the brother of john with the sword and because he saw it pleased the jews he proceeded further to take peter also then were the days of unleavened bread and when he had apprehended him he put him in prison and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him intending after easter to bring him forth to the people peter therefore was kept in prison but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto god for him and when herod would have brought him forth the same night peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains and the keepers before the door kept the prison and behold the angel of the lord came upon him and a light shined in the prison and he smote peter on the side and raised him up saying arise up quickly and his chains fell off from his hands and the angel said unto him gird thyself and bind on thy sandals and so he did and he saith unto him cast thy garment about thee and follow me and he went out and followed him and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel but thought he saw a vision when they were past the first and the second ward they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city which opened to them of his own accord and they went out and passed on through one street and forthwith the angel departed from him and when peter was come to himself he said now i know of a surety that the lord hath sent his angel and hath delivered me out of the hand of herod and from all the expectation of the people of the jews and when he had considered the thing he came to the house of mary the mother of john whose surname was mark where many were gathered together praying and as peter knocked at the door of the gate a damsel came to hearken named rhoda and when she knew peters voice she opened not the gate for gladness but ran in and told how peter stood before the gate and they said unto her thou art mad but she constantly affirmed that it was even so then said they it is his angel but peter continued knocking and when they had opened the door and saw him they were astonished but he beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace declared unto them how the lord had brought him out of the prison and he said go shew these things unto james and to the brethren and he departed and went
