afraid and he said nay but thou didst laugh and the men rose up from thence and looked toward sodom and abraham went with them to bring them on the way and the lord said shall i hide from abraham that thing which i do seeing that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him for i know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgment that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he hath spoken of him and the lord said because the cry of sodom and gomorrah is great and because their sin is very grievous i will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which is come unto me and if not i will know and the men turned their faces from thence and went toward sodom but abraham stood yet before the lord and abraham drew near and said wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein that be far from thee to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the wicked and that the righteous should be as the wicked that be far from thee shall not the judge of all the earth do right and the lord said if i find in sodom fifty righteous within the city then i will spare all the place for their sakes and abraham answered and said behold now i have taken upon me to speak unto the lord which am but dust and ashes peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five and he said if i find there forty and five i will not destroy it and he spake unto him yet again and said peradventure there shall be forty found there and he said i will not do it for fortys sake and he said unto him oh let not the lord be angry and i will speak peradventure there shall thirty be found there and he said i will not do it if i find thirty there and he said behold now i have taken upon me to speak unto the lord peradventure there shall be twenty found there and he said i will not destroy it for twentys sake and he said oh let not the lord be angry and i will speak yet but this once peradventure ten shall be found there and he said i will not destroy it for tens sake and the lord went his way as soon as he had left communing with abraham and abraham returned unto his place and there came two angels to sodom at even and lot sat in the gate of sodom and lot seeing them rose up to meet them and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground and he said behold now my lords turn in i pray you into your servants house and tarry all night and wash your feet and ye shall rise up early and go on your ways and they said nay but we will abide in the street all night and he pressed upon them greatly and they turned in unto him and entered into his house and he made them a feast and did bake unleavened bread and they did eat but before they lay down the men of the city even the men of sodom compassed the house round both old and young all the people from every quarter and they called unto lot and said unto him where are the men which came in to thee this night bring them out unto us that we may know them and lot went out at the door unto them and shut the door after him and said i pray you brethren do not so wickedly behold now i have two daughters which have not known man let me i pray you bring them out unto you and do ye to them as is good in your eyes only unto these men do nothing for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof and they said stand back and they said again this one fellow came in to sojourn and he will needs be a judge now will we deal worse with thee than with them and they pressed sore upon the man even lot and came near to break the door but the men put forth their hand and pulled lot into the house to them and shut to the door and they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness both small and great so that they wearied themselves to find the door and the men said unto lot hast thou here any besides son in law and thy sons and thy daughters and whatsoever thou hast in the city bring them out of this place for we will destroy this place because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the lord and the lord hath sent us to destroy it and lot went out and spake unto his sons in law which married his daughters and said up get you out of this place for the lord will destroy this city but he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law and when the morning arose then the angels hastened lot saying arise take thy wife and thy two daughters which are here lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city and while he lingered the men laid hold upon his hand and upon the hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters the lord being merciful unto him and they brought him forth and set him without the city and it came to pass when they had brought them forth abroad that he said escape for thy life look not behind thee neither stay thou in all the plain escape to the mountain lest thou be consumed and lot said unto them oh not so my lord behold now thy servant
