as they that tread the grapes against all the inhabitants of the earth a noise shall come even to the ends of the earth for the lord hath a controversy with the nations he will plead with all flesh he will give them that are wicked to the sword saith the lord thus saith the lord of hosts behold evil shall go forth from nation to nation and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth and the slain of the lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth they shall not be lamented neither gathered nor buried they shall be dung upon the ground howl ye shepherds and cry and wallow yourselves in the ashes ye principal of the flock for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel and the shepherds shall have no way to flee nor the principal of the flock to escape a voice of the cry of the shepherds and an howling of the principal of the flock shall be heard for the lord hath spoiled their pasture and the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of the lord he hath forsaken his covert as the lion for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor and because of his fierce anger in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah came this word from the lord saying thus saith the lord stand in the court of the lords house and speak unto all the cities of judah which come to worship in the lords house all the words that i command thee to speak unto them diminish not a word if so be they will hearken and turn every man from his evil way that i may repent me of the evil which i purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings and thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord if ye will not hearken to me to walk in my law which i have set before you to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets whom i sent unto you both rising up early and sending them but ye have not hearkened then will i make this house like shiloh and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth so the priests and the prophets and all the people heard jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the lord now it came to pass when jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the lord had commanded him to speak unto all the people that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him saying thou shalt surely die why hast thou prophesied in the name of the lord saying this house shall be like shiloh and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant and all the people were gathered against jeremiah in the house of the lord when the princes of judah heard these things then they came up from the kings house unto the house of the lord and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the lords house then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people saying this man is worthy to die for he hath prophesied against this city as ye have heard with your ears then spake jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people saying the lord sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard therefore now amend your ways and your doings and obey the voice of the lord your god and the lord will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you as for me behold i am in your hand do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you but know ye for certain that if ye put me to death ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and upon the inhabitants thereof for of a truth the lord hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets this man is not worthy to die for he hath spoken to us in the name of the lord our god then rose up certain of the elders of the land and spake to all the assembly of the people saying micah the morasthite prophesied in the days of hezekiah king of judah and spake to all the people of judah saying thus saith the lord of hosts zion shall be plowed like a field and jerusalem shall become heaps and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest did hezekiah king of judah and all judah put him at all to death did he not fear the lord and besought the lord and the lord repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them thus might we procure great evil against our souls and there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the lord urijah the son of shemaiah of kirjathjearim who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of jeremiah and when jehoiakim the king with all his mighty men and all the princes heard his words the king sought to put him to death but when urijah heard it he was afraid and fled and went into egypt and jehoiakim the king sent men into egypt namely elnathan the son of achbor and certain men with him into egypt and they fetched forth urijah out of egypt and brought him unto jehoiakim the king who slew him with the sword and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people nevertheless the hand of ahikam the son of shaphan was with jeremiah that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah came this word unto jeremiah from the lord saying thus
