and behold he drinketh but he awaketh and behold he is faint and his soul hath appetite so shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against mount zion stay yourselves and wonder cry ye out and cry they are drunken but not with wine they stagger but not with strong drink for the lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep and hath closed your eyes the prophets and your rulers the seers hath he covered and the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed which men deliver to one that is learned saying read this i pray thee and he saith i cannot for it is sealed and the book is delivered to him that is not learned saying read this i pray thee and he saith i am not learned wherefore the lord said forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth and with their lips do honour me but have removed their heart far from me and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men therefore behold i will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people even a marvellous work and a wonder for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the lord and their works are in the dark and they say who seeth us and who knoweth us surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potters clay for shall the work say of him that made it he made me not or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it he had no understanding is it not yet a very little while and lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest and in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness the meek also shall increase their joy in the lord and the poor among men shall rejoice in the holy one of israel for the terrible one is brought to nought and the scorner is consumed and all that watch for iniquity are cut off that make a man an offender for a word and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate and turn aside the just for a thing of nought therefore thus saith the lord who redeemed abraham concerning the house of jacob jacob shall not now be ashamed neither shall his face now wax pale but when he seeth his children the work of mine hands in the midst of him they shall sanctify my name and sanctify the holy one of jacob and shall fear the god of israel they also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding and they that murmured shall learn doctrine woe to the rebellious children saith the lord that take counsel but not of me and that cover with a covering but not of my spirit that they may add sin to sin that walk to go down into egypt and have not asked at my mouth to strengthen themselves in the strength of pharaoh and to trust in the shadow of egypt therefore shall the strength of pharaoh be your shame and the trust in the shadow of egypt your confusion for his princes were at zoan and his ambassadors came to hanes they were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them nor be an help nor profit but a shame and also a reproach the burden of the beasts of the south into the land of trouble and anguish from whence come the young and old lion the viper and fiery flying serpent they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses and their treasures upon the bunches of camels to a people that shall not profit them for the egyptians shall help in vain and to no purpose therefore have i cried concerning this their strength is to sit still now go write it before them in a table and note it in a book that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever that this is a rebellious people lying children children that will not hear the law of the lord which say to the seers see not and to the prophets prophesy not unto us right things speak unto us smooth things prophesy deceits get you out of the way turn aside out of the path cause the holy one of israel to cease from before us wherefore thus saith the holy one of israel because ye despise this word and trust in oppression and perverseness and stay thereon therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall swelling out in a high wall whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant and he shall break it as the breaking of the potters vessel that is broken in pieces he shall not spare so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth or to take water withal out of the pit for thus saith the lord god the holy one of israel in returning and rest shall ye be saved in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength and ye would not but ye said no for we will flee upon horses therefore shall ye flee and we will ride upon the swift therefore shall they that pursue you be swift one thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one at the rebuke of five shall ye flee till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain and as an ensign on an hill and therefore will the lord wait that he may be gracious unto you and therefore will he be exalted that he may have mercy upon you for the lord is a god of judgment blessed are all they that wait for him for the people shall dwell in zion at jerusalem thou shalt weep no more he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry when he shall hear
