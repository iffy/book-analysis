albeit i have not spoken therefore thus saith the lord god because ye have spoken vanity and seen lies therefore behold i am against you saith the lord god and mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity and that divine lies they shall not be in the assembly of my people neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of israel neither shall they enter into the land of israel and ye shall know that i am the lord god because even because they have seduced my people saying peace and there was no peace and one built up a wall and lo others daubed it with untempered morter say unto them which daub it with untempered morter that it shall fall there shall be an overflowing shower and ye o great hailstones shall fall and a stormy wind shall rend it lo when the wall is fallen shall it not be said unto you where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it therefore thus saith the lord god i will even rend it with a stormy wind in my fury and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger and great hailstones in my fury to consume it so will i break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered morter and bring it down to the ground so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered and it shall fall and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof and ye shall know that i am the lord thus will i accomplish my wrath upon the wall and upon them that have daubed it with untempered morter and will say unto you the wall is no more neither they that daubed it to wit the prophets of israel which prophesy concerning jerusalem and which see visions of peace for her and there is no peace saith the lord god likewise thou son of man set thy face against the daughters of thy people which prophesy out of their own heart and prophesy thou against them and say thus saith the lord god woe to the women that sew pillows to all armholes and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls will ye hunt the souls of my people and will ye save the souls alive that come unto you and will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread to slay the souls that should not die and to save the souls alive that should not live by your lying to my people that hear your lies wherefore thus saith the lord god behold i am against your pillows wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly and i will tear them from your arms and will let the souls go even the souls that ye hunt to make them fly your kerchiefs also will i tear and deliver my people out of your hand and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted and ye shall know that i am the lord because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad whom i have not made sad and strengthened the hands of the wicked that he should not return from his wicked way by promising him life therefore ye shall see no more vanity nor divine divinations for i will deliver my people out of your hand and ye shall know that i am the lord then came certain of the elders of israel unto me and sat before me and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man these men have set up their idols in their heart and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face should i be enquired of at all by them therefore speak unto them and say unto them thus saith the lord god every man of the house of israel that setteth up his idols in his heart and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face and cometh to the prophet i the lord will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols that i may take the house of israel in their own heart because they are all estranged from me through their idols therefore say unto the house of israel thus saith the lord god repent and turn yourselves from your idols and turn away your faces from all your abominations for every one of the house of israel or of the stranger that sojourneth in israel which separateth himself from me and setteth up his idols in his heart and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face and cometh to a prophet to enquire of him concerning me i the lord will answer him by myself and i will set my face against that man and will make him a sign and a proverb and i will cut him off from the midst of my people and ye shall know that i am the lord and if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing i the lord have deceived that prophet and i will stretch out my hand upon him and will destroy him from the midst of my people israel and they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh unto him that the house of israel may go no more astray from me neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions but that they may be my

upon it and will break the staff of the bread thereof and will send famine upon it and will cut off man and beast from it though these three men noah daniel and job were in it they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness saith the lord god if i cause noisome beasts to pass through the land and they spoil it so that it be desolate that no man may pass through because of the beasts
