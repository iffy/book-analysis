of the house of david and the glory of the inhabitants of jerusalem do not magnify themselves against judah in that day shall the lord defend the inhabitants of jerusalem and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as david and the house of david shall be as god as the angel of the lord before them and it shall come to pass in that day that i will seek to destroy all the nations that come against jerusalem and i will pour upon the house of david and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplications and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn in that day shall there be a great mourning in jerusalem as the mourning of hadadrimmon in the valley of megiddon and the land shall mourn every family apart the family of the house of david apart and their wives apart the family of the house of nathan apart and their wives apart the family of the house of levi apart and their wives apart the family of shimei apart and their wives apart all the families that remain every family apart and their wives apart in that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of david and to the inhabitants of jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness and it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord of hosts that i will cut off the names of the idols out of the land and they shall no more be remembered and also i will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land and it shall come to pass that when any shall yet prophesy then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him thou shalt not live for thou speakest lies in the name of the lord and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth and it shall come to pass in that day that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision when he hath prophesied neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive but he shall say i am no prophet i am an husbandman for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth and one shall say unto him what are these wounds in thine hands then he shall answer those with which i was wounded in the house of my friends awake o sword against my shepherd and against the man that is my fellow saith the lord of hosts smite the shepherd and the sheep shall be scattered and i will turn mine hand upon the little ones and it shall come to pass that in all the land saith the lord two parts therein shall be cut off and die but the third shall be left therein and i will bring the third part through the fire and will refine them as silver is refined and will try them as gold is tried they shall call on my name and i will hear them i will say it is my people and they shall say the lord is my god behold the day of the lord cometh and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee for i will gather all nations against jerusalem to battle and the city shall be taken and the houses rifled and the women ravished and half of the city shall go forth into captivity and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city then shall the lord go forth and fight against those nations as when he fought in the day of battle and his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of olives which is before jerusalem on the east and the mount of olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west and there shall be a very great valley and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north and half of it toward the south and ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto azal yea ye shall flee like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of uzziah king of judah and the lord my god shall come and all the saints with thee and it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark but it shall be one day which shall be known to the lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that at evening time it shall be light and it shall be in that day that living waters shall go out from jerusalem half of them toward the former sea and half of them toward the hinder sea in summer and in winter shall it be and the lord shall be king over all the earth in that day shall there be one lord and his name one all the land shall be turned as a plain from geba to rimmon south of jerusalem and it shall be lifted up and inhabited in her place from benjamins gate unto the place of the first gate unto the corner gate and from the tower of hananeel unto the kings winepresses and men shall dwell in it and there shall be no more utter destruction but jerusalem shall be safely inhabited and this shall be the plague wherewith the lord will smite all the people that have fought against jerusalem their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet and their eyes shall consume away in their holes and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth and it shall come to pass in that day that a great tumult from the lord shall be among them and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour and judah also shall fight at jerusalem and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gathered together gold and silver and apparel in
