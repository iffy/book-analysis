of jerusalem and men of judah judge i pray you betwixt me and my vineyard what could have been done more to my vineyard that i have not done in it wherefore when i looked that it should bring forth grapes brought it forth wild grapes and now go to i will tell you what i will do to my vineyard i will take away the hedge thereof and it shall be eaten up and break down the wall thereof and it shall be trodden down and i will lay it waste it shall not be pruned nor digged but there shall come up briers and thorns i will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it for the vineyard of the lord of hosts is the house of israel and the men of judah his pleasant plant and he looked for judgment but behold oppression for righteousness but behold a cry woe unto them that join house to house that lay field to field till there be no place that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth in mine ears said the lord of hosts of a truth many houses shall be desolate even great and fair without inhabitant yea ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah woe unto them that rise up early in the morning that they may follow strong drink that continue until night till wine inflame them and the harp and the viol the tabret and pipe and wine are in their feasts but they regard not the work of the lord neither consider the operation of his hands therefore my people are gone into captivity because they have no knowledge and their honourable men are famished and their multitude dried up with thirst therefore hell hath enlarged herself and opened her mouth without measure and their glory and their multitude and their pomp and he that rejoiceth shall descend into it and the mean man shall be brought down and the mighty man shall be humbled and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled but the lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment and god that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness then shall the lambs feed after their manner and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity and sin as it were with a cart rope that say let him make speed and hasten his work that we may see it and let the counsel of the holy one of israel draw nigh and come that we may know it woe unto them that call evil good and good evil that put darkness for light and light for darkness that put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes and prudent in their own sight woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine and men of strength to mingle strong drink which justify the wicked for reward and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble and the flame consumeth the chaff so their root shall be as rottenness and their blossom shall go up as dust because they have cast away the law of the lord of hosts and despised the word of the holy one of israel therefore is the anger of the lord kindled against his people and he hath stretched forth his hand against them and hath smitten them and the hills did tremble and their carcases were torn in the midst of the streets for all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still and he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth and behold they shall come with speed swiftly none shall be weary nor stumble among them none shall slumber nor sleep neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed nor the latchet of their shoes be broken whose arrows are sharp and all their bows bent their horses hoofs shall be counted like flint and their wheels like a whirlwind their roaring shall be like a lion they shall roar like young lions yea they shall roar and lay hold of the prey and shall carry it away safe and none shall deliver it and in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea and if one look unto the land behold darkness and sorrow and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof in the year that king uzziah died i saw also the lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it stood the seraphims each one had six wings with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and with twain he did fly and one cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said i woe is me for i am undone because i am a man of unclean lips and i dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphims unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said lo this hath touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin purged also i heard the voice of the lord saying whom shall i send and who will go for us then said i here am i send me and he said go and tell this people hear ye indeed but understand not and see ye indeed but perceive not make the heart of this people fat and make their ears heavy and shut their eyes lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and convert and be healed then said i lord how
