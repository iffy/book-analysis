he that ploweth should plow in hope and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope if we have sown unto you spiritual things is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things if others be partakers of this power over you are not we rather nevertheless we have not used this power but suffer all things lest we should hinder the gospel of christ do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar even so hath the lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel but i have used none of these things neither have i written these things that it should be so done unto me for it were better for me to die than that any man should make my glorying void for though i preach the gospel i have nothing to glory of for necessity is laid upon me yea woe is unto me if i preach not the gospel for if i do this thing willingly i have a reward but if against my will a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me what is my reward then verily that when i preach the gospel i may make the gospel of christ without charge that i abuse not my power in the gospel for though i be free from all men yet have i made myself servant unto all that i might gain the more and unto the jews i became as a jew that i might gain the jews to them that are under the law as under the law that i might gain them that are under the law to them that are without law as without law being not without law to god but under the law to christ that i might gain them that are without law to the weak became i as weak that i might gain the weak i am made all things to all men that i might by all means save some and this i do for the gospels sake that i might be partaker thereof with you know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain and every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown but we an incorruptible i therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight i not as one that beateth the air but i keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a castaway moreover brethren i would not that ye should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all baptized unto moses in the cloud and in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ but with many of them god was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted neither be ye idolaters as were some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand neither let us tempt christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer now all these things happened unto them for ensamples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but will with the temptation also make a way to escape that ye may be able to bear it wherefore my dearly beloved flee from idolatry i speak as to wise men judge ye what i say the cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion of the blood of christ the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of christ for we being many are one bread and one body for we are all partakers of that one bread behold israel after the flesh are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar what say i then that the idol is any thing or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing but i say that the things which the gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to devils and not to god and i would not that ye should have fellowship with devils ye cannot drink the cup of the lord and the cup of devils ye cannot be partakers of the lords table and of the table of devils do we provoke the lord to jealousy are we stronger than he all things are lawful for me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but all things edify not let no man seek his own but every man anothers wealth whatsoever is sold in the shambles that eat asking no question for conscience sake for the earth is the lords and the fulness thereof if any of them that believe not bid you to a feast and ye be disposed to go whatsoever is set before you eat asking no question for conscience sake but if any man say unto you this is offered in sacrifice unto idols eat not for his sake that shewed it and for conscience sake for the earth is the lords and the fulness thereof conscience i say not thine own but of the other for why is my liberty judged of another mans conscience for if i by grace be a partaker why am i
