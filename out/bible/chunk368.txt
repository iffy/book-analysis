people gather my saints together unto me those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice and the heavens shall declare his righteousness for god is judge himself selah hear o my people and i will speak o israel and i will testify against thee i am god even thy god i will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings to have been continually before me i will take no bullock out of thy house nor he goats out of thy folds for every beast of the forest is mine and the cattle upon a thousand hills i know all the fowls of the mountains and the wild beasts of the field are mine if i were hungry i would not tell thee for the world is mine and the fulness thereof will i eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats offer unto god thanksgiving and pay thy vows unto the most high and call upon me in the day of trouble i will deliver thee and thou shalt glorify me but unto the wicked god saith what hast thou to do to declare my statutes or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth seeing thou hatest instruction and casteth my words behind thee when thou sawest a thief then thou consentedst with him and hast been partaker with adulterers thou givest thy mouth to evil and thy tongue frameth deceit thou sittest and speakest against thy brother thou slanderest thine own mothers son these things hast thou done and i kept silence thou thoughtest that i was altogether such an one as thyself but i will reprove thee and set them in order before thine eyes now consider this ye that forget god lest i tear you in pieces and there be none to deliver whoso offereth praise glorifieth me and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will i shew the salvation of god have mercy upon me o god according to thy lovingkindness according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions wash me throughly from mine iniquity and cleanse me from my sin for i acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me against thee thee only have i sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judgest behold i was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom purge me with hyssop and i shall be clean wash me and i shall be whiter than snow make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice hide thy face from my sins and blot out all mine iniquities create in me a clean heart o god and renew a right spirit within me cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy holy spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit then will i teach transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto thee deliver me from bloodguiltiness o god thou god of my salvation and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness o lord open thou my lips and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise for thou desirest not sacrifice else would i give it thou delightest not in burnt offering the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken and a contrite heart o god thou wilt not despise do good in thy good pleasure unto zion build thou the walls of jerusalem then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness with burnt offering and whole burnt offering then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar why boastest thou thyself in mischief o mighty man the goodness of god endureth continually the tongue deviseth mischiefs like a sharp razor working deceitfully thou lovest evil more than good and lying rather than to speak righteousness selah thou lovest all devouring words o thou deceitful tongue god shall likewise destroy thee for ever he shall take thee away and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place and root thee out of the land of the living selah the righteous also shall see and fear and shall laugh at him lo this is the man that made not god his strength but trusted in the abundance of his riches and strengthened himself in his wickedness but i am like a green olive tree in the house of god i trust in the mercy of god for ever and ever i will praise thee for ever because thou hast done it and i will wait on thy name for it is good before thy saints the fool hath said in his heart there is no god corrupt are they and have done abominable iniquity there is none that doeth good god looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand that did seek god every one of them is gone back they are altogether become filthy there is none that doeth good no not one have the workers of iniquity no knowledge who eat up my people as they eat bread they have not called upon god there were they in great fear where no fear was for god hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee thou hast put them to shame because god hath despised them oh that the salvation of israel were come out of zion when god bringeth back the captivity of his people jacob shall rejoice and israel shall be glad save me o god by thy name and judge me by thy strength hear my prayer o god give ear to the words of my mouth for strangers are risen up against me and oppressors seek after my soul they have not set god before them selah behold god is mine helper the lord is with them that uphold my soul he shall reward evil unto mine enemies cut them off in thy truth i will freely sacrifice unto thee i will praise thy name o lord for it is good for he hath delivered me out of all trouble and mine eye
