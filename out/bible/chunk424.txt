whole earth is at rest and is quiet they break forth into singing yea the fir trees rejoice at thee and the cedars of lebanon saying since thou art laid down no feller is come up against us hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming it stirreth up the dead for thee even all the chief ones of the earth it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations all they shall speak and say unto thee art thou also become weak as we art thou become like unto us thy pomp is brought down to the grave and the noise of thy viols the worm is spread under thee and the worms cover thee how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken the nations for thou hast said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made the earth to tremble that did shake kingdoms that made the world as a wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof that opened not the house of his prisoners all the kings of the nations even all of them lie in glory every one in his own house but thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch and as the raiment of those that are slain thrust through with a sword that go down to the stones of the pit as a carcase trodden under feet thou shalt not be joined with them in burial because thou hast destroyed thy land and slain thy people the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers that they do not rise nor possess the land nor fill the face of the world with cities for i will rise up against them saith the lord of hosts and cut off from babylon the name and remnant and son and nephew saith the lord i will also make it a possession for the bittern and pools of water and i will sweep it with the besom of destruction saith the lord of hosts the lord of hosts hath sworn saying surely as i have thought so shall it come to pass and as i have purposed so shall it stand that i will break the assyrian in my land and upon my mountains tread him under foot then shall his yoke depart from off them and his burden depart from off their shoulders this is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations for the lord of hosts hath purposed and who shall disannul it and his hand is stretched out and who shall turn it back in the year that king ahaz died was this burden rejoice not thou whole palestina because the rod of him that smote thee is broken for out of the serpents root shall come forth a cockatrice and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent and the firstborn of the poor shall feed and the needy shall lie down in safety and i will kill thy root with famine and he shall slay thy remnant howl o gate cry o city thou whole palestina art dissolved for there shall come from the north a smoke and none shall be alone in his appointed times what shall one then answer the messengers of the nation that the lord hath founded zion and the poor of his people shall trust in it the burden of moab because in the night ar of moab is laid waste and brought to silence because in the night kir of moab is laid waste and brought to silence he is gone up to bajith and to dibon the high places to weep moab shall howl over nebo and over medeba on all their heads shall be baldness and every beard cut off in their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth on the tops of their houses and in their streets every one shall howl weeping abundantly and heshbon shall cry and elealeh their voice shall be heard even unto jahaz therefore the armed soldiers of moab shall cry out his life shall be grievous unto him my heart shall cry out for moab his fugitives shall flee unto zoar an heifer of three years old for by the mounting up of luhith with weeping shall they go it up for in the way of horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction for the waters of nimrim shall be desolate for the hay is withered away the grass faileth there is no green thing therefore the abundance they have gotten and that which they have laid up shall they carry away to the brook of the willows for the cry is gone round about the borders of moab the howling thereof unto eglaim and the howling thereof unto beerelim for the waters of dimon shall be full of blood for i will bring more upon dimon lions upon him that escapeth of moab and upon the remnant of the land send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from sela to the wilderness unto the mount of the daughter of zion for it shall be that as a wandering bird cast out of the nest so the daughters of moab shall be at the fords of arnon take counsel execute judgment make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday hide the outcasts bewray not him that wandereth let mine outcasts dwell with thee moab be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler for the extortioner is at an end the spoiler ceaseth the oppressors are consumed out of the land and in mercy shall the throne be established and he shall sit upon it in truth
