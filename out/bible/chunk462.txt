the sword before their enemies saith the lord woe is me my mother that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth i have neither lent on usury nor men have lent to me on usury yet every one of them doth curse me the lord said verily it shall be well with thy remnant verily i will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil and in the time of affliction shall iron break the northern iron and the steel thy substance and thy treasures will i give to the spoil without price and that for all thy sins even in all thy borders and i will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not for a fire is kindled in mine anger which shall burn upon you o lord thou knowest remember me and visit me and revenge me of my persecutors take me not away in thy longsuffering know that for thy sake i have suffered rebuke thy words were found and i did eat them and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart for i am called by thy name o lord god of hosts i sat not in the assembly of the mockers nor rejoiced i sat alone because of thy hand for thou hast filled me with indignation why is my pain perpetual and my wound incurable which refuseth to be healed wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar and as waters that fail therefore thus saith the lord if thou return then will i bring thee again and thou shalt stand before me and if thou take forth the precious from the vile thou shalt be as my mouth let them return unto thee but return not thou unto them and i will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall and they shall fight against thee but they shall not prevail against thee for i am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee saith the lord and i will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked and i will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible the word of the lord came also unto me saying thou shalt not take thee a wife neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place for thus saith the lord concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place and concerning their mothers that bare them and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land they shall die of grievous deaths they shall not be lamented neither shall they be buried but they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth and they shall be consumed by the sword and by famine and their carcases shall be meat for the fowls of heaven and for the beasts of the earth for thus saith the lord enter not into the house of mourning neither go to lament nor bemoan them for i have taken away my peace from this people saith the lord even lovingkindness and mercies both the great and the small shall die in this land they shall not be buried neither shall men lament for them nor cut themselves nor make themselves bald for them neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning to comfort them for the dead neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting to sit with them to eat and to drink for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes and in your days the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride and it shall come to pass when thou shalt shew this people all these words and they shall say unto thee wherefore hath the lord pronounced all this great evil against us or what is our iniquity or what is our sin that we have committed against the lord our god then shalt thou say unto them because your fathers have forsaken me saith the lord and have walked after other gods and have served them and have worshipped them and have forsaken me and have not kept my law and ye have done worse than your fathers for behold ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart that they may not hearken unto me therefore will i cast you out of this land into a land that ye know not neither ye nor your fathers and there shall ye serve other gods day and night where i will not shew you favour therefore behold the days come saith the lord that it shall no more be said the lord liveth that brought up the children of israel out of the land of egypt but the lord liveth that brought up the children of israel from the land of the north and from all the lands whither he had driven them and i will bring them again into their land that i gave unto their fathers behold i will send for many fishers saith the lord and they shall fish them and after will i send for many hunters and they shall hunt them from every mountain and from every hill and out of the holes of the rocks for mine eyes are upon all their ways they are not hid from my face neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes and first i will recompense their iniquity and their sin double because they have defiled my land they have filled mine inheritance with the carcases of their detestable and abominable things o lord my strength and my fortress and my refuge in the day of affliction the gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth and shall say surely our fathers have inherited lies vanity and things wherein there is no profit shall a man make gods unto himself and they are no gods therefore behold i will this once cause them to know i will cause them to know mine hand and my might and they
