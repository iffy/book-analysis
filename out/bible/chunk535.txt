the intent that the living may know that the most high ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will and setteth up over it the basest of men this dream i king nebuchadnezzar have seen now thou o belteshazzar declare the interpretation thereof forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation but thou art able for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee then daniel whose name was belteshazzar was astonied for one hour and his thoughts troubled him the king spake and said belteshazzar let not the dream or the interpretation thereof trouble thee belteshazzar answered and said my lord the dream be to them that hate thee and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies the tree that thou sawest which grew and was strong whose height reached unto the heaven and the sight thereof to all the earth whose leaves were fair and the fruit thereof much and in it was meat for all under which the beasts of the field dwelt and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation it is thou o king that art grown and become strong for thy greatness is grown and reacheth unto heaven and thy dominion to the end of the earth and whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven and saying hew the tree down and destroy it yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth even with a band of iron and brass in the tender grass of the field and let it be wet with the dew of heaven and let his portion be with the beasts of the field till seven times pass over him this is the interpretation o king and this is the decree of the most high which is come upon my lord the king that they shall drive thee from men and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven and seven times shall pass over thee till thou know that the most high ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will and whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule wherefore o king let my counsel be acceptable unto thee and break off thy sins by righteousness and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity all this came upon the king nebuchadnezzar at the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of babylon the king spake and said is not this great babylon that i have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power and for the honour of my majesty while the word was in the kings mouth there fell a voice from heaven saying o king nebuchadnezzar to thee it is spoken the kingdom is departed from thee and they shall drive thee from men and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen and seven times shall pass over thee until thou know that the most high ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will the same hour was the thing fulfilled upon nebuchadnezzar and he was driven from men and did eat grass as oxen and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hairs were grown like eagles feathers and his nails like birds claws and at the end of the days i nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven and mine understanding returned unto me and i blessed the most high and i praised and honoured him that liveth for ever whose dominion is an everlasting dominion and his kingdom is from generation to

unto him what doest thou at the same time my reason returned unto me and for the glory of my kingdom mine honour and brightness returned unto me and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me and i was established in my kingdom and excellent majesty was added unto me now i nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the king of heaven all whose works are truth and his ways judgment and those that

praised the gods of gold and of silver of brass of iron of wood and of stone in the same hour came forth fingers of a mans hand and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of

me the interpretation thereof shall be clothed with scarlet and have a chain of gold about his neck and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom then came in all the kings wise men but they could not
