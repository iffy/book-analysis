words of david and of asaph the seer and they sang praises with gladness and they bowed their heads and worshipped then hezekiah answered and said now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the lord come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the lord and the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings and the number of the burnt offerings which the congregation brought was threescore and ten bullocks an hundred rams and two hundred lambs all these were for a burnt offering to the lord and the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep but the priests were too few so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings wherefore their brethren the levites did help them till the work was ended and until the other priests had sanctified themselves for the levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests and also the burnt offerings were in abundance with the fat of the peace offerings and the drink offerings for every burnt offering so the service of the house of the lord was set in order and hezekiah rejoiced and all the people that god had prepared the people for the thing was done suddenly and hezekiah sent to all israel and judah and wrote letters also to ephraim and manasseh that they should come to the house of the lord at jerusalem to keep the passover unto the lord god of israel for the king had taken counsel and his princes and all the congregation in jerusalem to keep the passover in the second month for they could not keep it at that time because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently neither had the people gathered themselves together to jerusalem and the thing pleased the king and all the congregation so they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all israel from beersheba even to dan that they should come to keep the passover unto the lord god of israel at jerusalem for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was written so the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all israel and judah and according to the commandment of the king saying ye children of israel turn again unto the lord god of abraham isaac and israel and he will return to the remnant of you that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of assyria and be not ye like your fathers and like your brethren which trespassed against the lord god of their fathers who therefore gave them up to desolation as ye see now be ye not stiffnecked as your fathers were but yield yourselves unto the lord and enter into his sanctuary which he hath sanctified for ever and serve the lord your god that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you for if ye turn again unto the lord your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive so that they shall come again into this land for the lord your god is gracious and merciful and will not turn away his face from you if ye return unto him so the posts passed from city to city through the country of ephraim and manasseh even unto zebulun but they laughed them to scorn and mocked them nevertheless divers of asher and manasseh and of zebulun humbled themselves and came to jerusalem also in judah the hand of god was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of the lord and there assembled at jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month a very great congregation and they arose and took away the altars that were in jerusalem and all the altars for incense took they away and cast them into the brook kidron then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month and the priests and the levites were ashamed and sanctified themselves and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the lord and they stood in their place after their manner according to the law of moses the man of god the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of the hand of the levites for there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified therefore the levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean to sanctify them unto the lord for a multitude of the people even many of ephraim and manasseh issachar and zebulun had not cleansed themselves yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written but hezekiah prayed for them saying the good lord pardon every one that prepareth his heart to seek god the lord god of his fathers though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary and the lord hearkened to hezekiah and healed the people and the children of israel that were present at jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness and the levites and the priests praised the lord day by day singing with loud instruments unto the lord and hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the levites that taught the good knowledge of the lord and they did eat throughout the feast seven days offering peace offerings and making confession to the lord god of their fathers and the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days and they kept other seven days with gladness for hezekiah king of judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep and a great number of priests sanctified themselves and all the congregation of judah with the priests and the levites and all the congregation that came out of israel and the strangers that came out of the land of israel and that dwelt in judah rejoiced so there was great joy in jerusalem for since the time of solomon the son of david king of israel there was not the like in jerusalem then the priests the levites arose and blessed
