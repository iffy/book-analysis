paul at berea they came thither also and stirred up the people and then immediately the brethren sent away paul to go as it were to the sea but silas and timotheus abode there still and they that conducted paul brought him unto athens and receiving a commandment unto silas and timotheus for to come to him with all speed they departed now while paul waited for them at athens his spirit was stirred in him when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the jews and with the devout persons and in the market daily with them that met with him then certain philosophers of the epicureans and of the stoicks encountered him and some said what will this babbler say other some he seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods because he preached unto them jesus and the resurrection and they took him and brought him unto areopagus saying may we know what this new doctrine whereof thou speakest is for thou bringest certain strange things to our ears we would know therefore what these things mean for all the athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing then paul stood in the midst of mars hill and said ye men of athens i perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious for as i passed by and beheld your devotions i found an altar with this inscription to the unknown god whom therefore ye ignorantly worship him declare i unto you god that made the world and all things therein seeing that he is lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands neither is worshipped with mens hands as though he needed any thing seeing he giveth to all life and breath and all things and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth and hath determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation that they should seek the lord if haply they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own poets have said for we are also his offspring forasmuch then as we are the offspring of god we ought not to think that the godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone graven by art and mans device and the times of this ignorance god winked at but now commandeth all men every where to repent because he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained whereof he hath given assurance unto all men in that he hath raised him from the dead and when they heard of the resurrection of the dead some mocked and others said we will hear thee again of this matter so paul departed from among them howbeit certain men clave unto him and believed among the which was dionysius the areopagite and a woman named damaris and others with them after these things paul departed from athens and came to corinth and found a certain jew named aquila born in pontus lately come from italy with his wife priscilla because that claudius had commanded all jews to depart from rome and came unto them and because he was of the same craft he abode with them and wrought for by their occupation they were tentmakers and he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath and persuaded the jews and the greeks and when silas and timotheus were come from macedonia paul was pressed in the spirit and testified to the jews that jesus was christ and when they opposed themselves and blasphemed he shook his raiment and said unto them your blood be upon your own heads i am clean from henceforth i will go unto the gentiles and he departed thence and entered into a certain mans house named justus one that worshipped god whose house joined hard to the synagogue and crispus the chief ruler of the synagogue believed on the lord with all his house and many of the corinthians hearing believed and were baptized then spake the lord to paul in the night by a vision be not afraid but speak and hold not thy peace for i am with thee and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee for i have much people in this city and he continued there a year and six months teaching the word of god among them and when gallio was the deputy of achaia the jews made insurrection with one accord against paul and brought him to the judgment seat saying this fellow persuadeth men to worship god contrary to the law and when paul was now about to open his mouth gallio said unto the jews if it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness o ye jews reason would that i should bear with you but if it be a question of words and names and of your law look ye to it for i will be no judge of such matters and he drave them from the judgment seat then all the greeks took sosthenes the chief ruler of the synagogue and beat him before the judgment seat and gallio cared for none of those things and paul after this tarried there yet a good while and then took his leave of the brethren and sailed thence into syria and with him priscilla and aquila having shorn his head in cenchrea for he had a vow and he came to ephesus and left them there but he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the jews when they desired him to tarry longer time with them he consented not but bade them farewell saying i must by all means keep this feast that cometh in jerusalem but i will return again unto you if god will and he sailed from ephesus and when he had landed at caesarea and gone up and saluted the church he went down to antioch and after he had spent some time there he departed and went over all the country of
