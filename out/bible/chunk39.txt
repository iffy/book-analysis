vain words and the taskmasters of the people went out and their officers and they spake to the people saying thus saith pharaoh i will not give you straw go ye get you straw where ye can find it yet not ought of your work shall be diminished so the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of egypt to gather stubble instead of straw and the taskmasters hasted them saying fulfil your works your daily tasks as when there was straw and the officers of the children of israel which pharaohs taskmasters had set over them were beaten and demanded wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day as heretofore then the officers of the children of israel came and cried unto pharaoh saying wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants there is no straw given unto thy servants and they say to us make brick and behold thy servants are beaten but the fault is in thine own people but he said ye are idle ye are idle therefore ye say let us go and do sacrifice to the lord go therefore now and work for there shall no straw be given you yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks and the officers of the children of israel did see that they were in evil case after it was said ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task and they met moses and aaron who stood in the way as they came forth from pharaoh and they said unto them the lord look upon you and judge because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants to put a sword in their hand to slay us and moses returned unto the lord and said lord wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people why is it that thou hast sent me for since i came to pharaoh to speak in thy name he hath done evil to this people neither hast thou delivered thy people at all then the lord said unto moses now shalt thou see what i will do to pharaoh for with a strong hand shall he let them go and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land and god spake unto moses and said unto him i am the lord and i appeared unto abraham unto isaac and unto jacob by the name of god almighty but by my name jehovah was i not known to them and i have also established my covenant with them to give them the land of canaan the land of their pilgrimage wherein they were strangers and i have also heard the groaning of the children of israel whom the egyptians keep in bondage and i have remembered my covenant wherefore say unto the children of israel i am the lord and i will bring you out from under the burdens of the egyptians and i will rid you out of their bondage and i will redeem you with a stretched out arm and with great judgments and i will take you to me for a people and i will be to you a god and ye shall know that i am the lord your god which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the egyptians and i will bring you in unto the land concerning the which i did swear to give it to abraham to isaac and to jacob and i will give it you for an heritage i am the lord and moses spake so unto the children of israel but they hearkened not unto moses for anguish of spirit and for cruel bondage and the lord spake unto moses saying go in speak unto pharaoh king of egypt that he let the children of israel go out of his land and moses spake before the lord saying behold the children of israel have not hearkened unto
