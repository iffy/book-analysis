servant put his hand under the thigh of abraham his master and sware to him concerning that matter and the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master and departed for all the goods of his master were in his hand and he arose and went to mesopotamia unto the city of nahor and he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening even the time that women go out to draw water and he said o lord god of my master abraham i pray thee send me good speed this day and shew kindness unto my master abraham behold i stand here by the well of water and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water and let it come to pass that the damsel to whom i shall say let down thy pitcher i pray thee that i may drink and she shall say drink and i will give thy camels drink also let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant isaac and thereby shall i know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master and it came to pass before he had done speaking that behold rebekah came out who was born to bethuel son of milcah the wife of nahor abrahams brother with her pitcher upon her shoulder and the damsel was very fair to look upon a virgin neither had any man known her and she went down to the well and filled her pitcher and came up and the servant ran to meet her and said let me i pray thee drink a little water of thy pitcher and she said drink my lord and she hasted and let down her pitcher upon her hand and gave him drink and when she had done giving him drink she said i will draw water for thy camels also until they have done drinking and she hasted and emptied her pitcher into the trough and ran again unto the well to draw water and drew for all his camels and the man wondering at her held his peace to wit whether the lord had made his journey prosperous or not and it came to pass as the camels had done drinking that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold and said whose daughter art thou tell me i pray thee is there room in thy fathers house for us to lodge in and she said unto him i am the daughter of bethuel the son of milcah which she bare unto nahor she said moreover unto him we have both straw and provender enough and room to lodge in and the man bowed down his head and worshipped the lord and he said blessed be the lord god of my master abraham who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth i being in the way the lord led me to the house of my masters brethren and the damsel ran and told them of her mothers house these things and rebekah had a brother and his name was laban and laban ran out unto the man unto the well and it came to pass when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sisters hands and when he heard the words of rebekah his sister saying thus spake the man unto me that he came unto the man and behold he stood by the camels at the well and he said come in thou blessed of the lord wherefore standest thou without for i have prepared the house and room for the camels and the man came into the house and he ungirded his camels and gave straw and provender for the camels and water to wash his feet and the mens feet that were with him and there was set meat before him to eat but he said i will not eat until i have told mine errand and he said speak on and he said i am abrahams servant and the lord hath blessed my master greatly and he is become great and he hath given him flocks and herds and silver and gold and menservants and maidservants and camels and asses and sarah my masters wife bare a son to my master when she was old and unto him hath he given all that he hath and my master made me swear saying thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the canaanites in whose land i dwell but thou shalt go unto my fathers house and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son and i said unto my master peradventure the woman will not follow me and he said unto me the lord before whom i walk will send his angel with thee and prosper thy way and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred and of my fathers house then shalt thou be clear from this my oath when thou comest to my kindred and if they give not thee one thou shalt be clear from my oath and i came this day unto the well and said o lord god of my master abraham if now thou do prosper my way which i go behold i stand by the well of water and it shall come to pass that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water and i say to her give me i pray thee a little water of thy pitcher to drink and she say to me both drink thou and i will also draw for thy camels let the same be the woman whom the lord hath appointed out for my masters son and before i had done speaking in mine heart behold rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder and she went down unto the well and drew water and i said unto her let me drink i pray thee and she made haste and let down her pitcher from her shoulder and said drink and i will give thy camels drink also so i drank and she made the camels drink also and i asked her and said whose daughter art thou and she said
