king said unto him do as he hath said and fall upon him and bury him that thou mayest take away the innocent blood which joab shed from me and from the house of my father and the lord shall return his blood upon his own head who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he and slew them with the sword my father david not knowing thereof to wit abner the son of ner captain of the host of israel and amasa the son of jether captain of the host of judah their blood shall therefore return upon the head of joab and upon the head of his seed for ever but upon david and upon his seed and upon his house and upon his throne shall there be peace for ever from the lord so benaiah the son of jehoiada went up and fell upon him and slew him and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness and the king put benaiah the son of jehoiada in his room over the host and zadok the priest did the king put in the room of abiathar and the king sent and called for shimei and said unto him build thee an house in jerusalem and dwell there and go not forth thence any whither for it shall be that on the day thou goest out and passest over the brook kidron thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die thy blood shall be upon thine own head and shimei said unto the king the saying is good as my lord the king hath said so will thy servant do and shimei dwelt in jerusalem many days and it came to pass at the end of three years that two of the servants of shimei ran away unto achish son of maachah king of gath and they told shimei saying behold thy servants be in gath and shimei arose and saddled his ass and went to gath to achish to seek his servants and shimei went and brought his servants from gath and it was told solomon that shimei had gone from jerusalem to gath and was come again and the king sent and called for shimei and said unto him did i not make thee to swear by the lord and protested unto thee saying know for a certain on the day thou goest out and walkest abroad any whither that thou shalt surely die and thou saidst unto me the word that i have heard is good why then hast thou not kept the oath of the lord and the commandment that i have charged thee with the king said moreover to shimei thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to that thou didst to david my father therefore the lord shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head and king solomon shall be blessed and the throne of david shall be established before the lord for ever so the king commanded benaiah the son of jehoiada which went out and fell upon him that he died and the kingdom was established in the hand of solomon and solomon made affinity with pharaoh king of egypt and took pharaohs daughter and brought her into the city of david until he had made an end of building his own house and the house of the lord and the wall of jerusalem round about only the people sacrificed in high places because there was no house built unto the name of the lord until those days and solomon loved the lord walking in the statutes of david his father only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places and the king went to gibeon to sacrifice there for that was the great high place a thousand burnt offerings did solomon offer upon that altar in gibeon the lord appeared to solomon in a dream by night and god said ask what i shall give thee and solomon said thou hast shewed unto thy servant david my father great mercy according as he walked before thee in truth and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with thee and thou hast kept for him this great kindness that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne as it is this day and now o lord my god thou hast made thy servant king instead of david my father and i am but a little child i know not how to go out or come in and thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen a great people that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people that i may discern between good and bad for who is able to judge this thy so great a people and the speech pleased the lord that solomon had asked this thing and god said unto him because thou hast asked this thing and hast not asked for thyself long life neither hast asked riches for thyself nor hast asked the life of thine enemies but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment behold i have done according to thy words lo i have given thee a wise and an understanding heart so that there was none like thee before thee neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee and i have also given thee that which thou hast not asked both riches and honour so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days and if thou wilt walk in my ways to keep my statutes and my commandments as thy father david did walk then i will lengthen thy days and solomon awoke and behold it was a dream and he came to jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the lord and offered up burnt offerings and offered peace offerings and made a feast to all his servants then came there two women that were harlots unto the king and stood before him and the one woman said o my lord i and this woman dwell in one house and i was delivered of a child with her in the house and it came to pass the third day after that i was delivered that this woman was delivered also and
