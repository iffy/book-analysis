moses said unto his father in law because the people come unto me to enquire of god when they have a matter they come unto me and i judge between one and another and i do make them know the statutes of god and his laws and moses father in law said unto him the thing that thou doest is not good thou wilt surely wear away both thou and this people that is with thee for this thing is too heavy for thee thou art not able to perform it thyself alone hearken now unto my voice i will give thee counsel and god shall be with thee be thou for the people to god-ward that thou mayest bring the causes unto god and thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk and the work that they must do moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men such as fear god men of truth hating covetousness and place such over them to be rulers of thousands and rulers of hundreds rulers of fifties and rulers of tens and let them judge the people at all seasons and it shall be that every great matter they shall bring unto thee but every small matter they shall judge so shall it be easier for thyself and they shall bear the burden with thee if thou shalt do this thing and god command thee so then thou shalt be able to endure and all this people shall also go to their place in peace so moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law and did all that he had said and moses chose able men out of all israel and made them heads over the people rulers of thousands rulers of hundreds rulers of fifties and rulers of tens and they judged the people at all seasons the hard causes they brought unto moses but every small matter they judged themselves and moses let his father in law depart and he went his way into his own land in the third month when the children of israel were gone forth out of the land of egypt the same day came they into the wilderness of sinai for they were departed from rephidim and were come to the desert of sinai and had pitched in the wilderness and there israel camped before the mount and moses went up unto god and the lord called unto him out of the mountain saying thus shalt thou say to the house of jacob and tell the children of israel ye have seen what i did unto the egyptians and how i bare you on eagles wings and brought you unto myself now therefore if ye will obey my voice indeed and keep my covenant then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the earth is mine and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and an holy nation these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of israel and moses came and called for the elders of the people and laid before their faces all these words which the lord commanded him and all the people answered together and said all that the lord hath spoken we will do and moses returned the words of the people unto the lord and the lord said unto moses lo i come unto thee in a thick cloud that the people may hear when i speak with thee and believe thee for ever and moses told the words of the people unto the lord and the lord said unto moses go unto the people and sanctify them to day and to morrow and let them wash their clothes and be ready against the third day for the third day the lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount sinai and thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about saying take heed to yourselves that ye go not up into the mount or touch the border of it whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death there shall not an hand touch it but he shall surely be stoned or shot through whether it be beast or man it shall not live when the trumpet soundeth long they shall come up to the mount and moses went down from the mount unto the people and sanctified the people and they washed their clothes and he said unto the people be ready against the third day come not at your wives and it came to pass on the third day in the morning that there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud upon the mount and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud so that all the people that was in the camp trembled and moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with god and they stood at the nether part of the mount and mount sinai was altogether on a smoke because the lord descended upon it in fire and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace and the whole mount quaked greatly and when the voice of the trumpet sounded long and waxed louder and louder moses spake and god answered him by a voice and the lord came down upon mount sinai on the top of the mount and the lord called moses up to the top of the mount and moses went up and the lord said unto moses go down charge the people lest they break through unto the lord to gaze and many of them perish and let the priests also which come near to the lord sanctify themselves lest the lord break forth upon them and moses said unto the lord the people cannot come up to mount sinai for thou chargedst us saying set bounds about the mount and sanctify it and the lord said unto him away get thee down and thou shalt come up thou and aaron with thee but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the lord lest he break forth upon them so moses went down unto the people and spake unto them and god spake all these words saying i am the lord thy god which have brought thee
