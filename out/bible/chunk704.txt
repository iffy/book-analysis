as many as have not seen my face in the flesh that their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding to the acknowledgement of the mystery of god and of the father and of christ in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge and this i say lest any man should beguile you with enticing words for though i be absent in the flesh yet am i with you in the spirit joying and beholding your order and the stedfastness of your faith in christ as ye have therefore received christ jesus the lord so walk ye in him rooted and built up in him and stablished in the faith as ye have been taught abounding therein with thanksgiving beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after christ for in him dwelleth all the fulness of the godhead bodily and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of christ buried with him in baptism wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of god who hath raised him from the dead and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross and having spoiled principalities and powers he made a shew of them openly triumphing over them in it let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink or in respect of an holyday or of the new moon or of the sabbath days which are a shadow of things to come but the body is of christ let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels intruding into those things which he hath not seen vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind and not holding the head from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered and knit together increaseth with the increase of god wherefore if ye be dead with christ from the rudiments of the world why as though living in the world are ye subject to ordinances touch not taste not handle not which all are to perish with the using after the commandments and doctrines of men which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship and humility and neglecting of the body not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh if ye then be risen with christ seek those things which are above where christ sitteth on the right hand of god set your affection on things above not on things on the earth for ye are dead and your life is hid with christ in god when christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscence and covetousness which is idolatry for which things sake the wrath of god cometh on the children of disobedience in the which ye also walked some time when ye lived in them but now ye also put off all these anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth lie not one to another seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him where there is neither greek nor jew circumcision nor uncircumcision barbarian scythian bond nor free but christ is all and in all put on therefore as the elect of god holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of mind meekness longsuffering forbearing one another and forgiving one another if any man have a quarrel against any even as christ forgave you so also do ye and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness and let the peace of god rule in your hearts to the which also ye are called in one body and be ye thankful let the word of christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to the lord and whatsoever ye do in word or deed do all in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god and the father by him wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as it is fit in the lord husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them children obey your parents in all things for this is well pleasing unto the lord fathers provoke not your children to anger lest they be discouraged servants obey in all things your masters according to the flesh not with eyeservice as menpleasers but in singleness of heart fearing god and whatsoever ye do do it heartily as to the lord and not unto men knowing that of the lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance for ye serve the lord christ but he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done and there is no respect of persons masters give unto your servants that which is just and equal knowing that ye also have a master in heaven continue in prayer and watch in the same with thanksgiving withal praying also for us that god would open unto us a door of utterance to speak the mystery of christ for which i am also in bonds that i may make it manifest as i ought to speak walk in wisdom toward them that are without redeeming the time let your speech be alway with grace seasoned with salt that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man all my state shall tychicus declare unto you who is a beloved brother and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the lord whom i have sent unto
