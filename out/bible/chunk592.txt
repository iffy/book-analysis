and they spit upon him and took the reed and smote him on the head and after that they had mocked him they took the robe off from him and put his own raiment on him and led him away to crucify him and as they came out they found a man of cyrene simon by name him they compelled to bear his cross and when they were come unto a place called golgotha that is to say a place of a skull they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall and when he had tasted thereof he would not drink and they crucified him and parted his garments casting lots that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet they parted my garments among them and upon my vesture did they cast lots and sitting down they watched him there and set up over his head his accusation written this is jesus the king of the jews then were there two thieves crucified with him one on the right hand and another on the left and they that passed by reviled him wagging their heads and saying thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days save thyself if thou be the son of god come down from the cross likewise also the chief priests mocking him with the scribes and elders said he saved others himself he cannot save if he be the king of israel let him now come down from the cross and we will believe him he trusted in god let him deliver him now if he will have him for he said i am the son of god the thieves also which were crucified with him cast the same in his teeth now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour and about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice saying eli eli lama sabachthani that is to say my god my god why hast thou forsaken me some of them that stood there when they heard that said this man calleth for elias and straightway one of them ran and took a spunge and filled it with vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him to drink the rest said let be let us see whether elias will come to save him jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up the ghost and behold the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rent and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many now when the centurion and they that were with him watching jesus saw the earthquake and those things that were done they feared greatly saying truly this was the son of god and many women were there beholding afar off which followed jesus from galilee ministering unto him among which was mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and joses and the mother of zebedees children when the even was come there came a rich man of arimathaea named joseph who also himself was jesus disciple he went to pilate and begged the body of jesus then pilate commanded the body to be delivered and when joseph had taken the body he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth and laid it in his own new tomb which he had hewn out in the rock and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre and departed and there was mary magdalene and the other mary sitting over against the sepulchre now the next day that followed the day of the preparation the chief priests and pharisees came together unto pilate saying sir we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive after three days i will rise again command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day lest his disciples come by night and steal him away and say unto the people he is risen from the dead so the last error shall be worse than the first pilate said unto them ye have a watch go your way make it as sure as ye can so they went and made the sepulchre sure sealing the stone and setting a watch in the end of the sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week came mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulchre and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it his countenance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow and for fear of him the keepers did shake and became as dead men and the angel answered and said unto the women fear not ye for i know that ye seek jesus which was crucified he is not here for he is risen as he said come see the place where the lord lay and go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead and behold he goeth before you into galilee there shall ye see him lo i have told you and they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy and did run to bring his disciples word and as they went to tell his disciples behold jesus met them saying all hail and they came and held him by the feet and worshipped him then said jesus unto them be not afraid go tell my brethren that they go into galilee and there shall they see me now when they were going behold some of the watch came into the city and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done and when they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel they gave large money unto the soldiers saying say ye his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept and if this come to the governors ears we will persuade him and secure you so they took the money and did as they were taught and this saying is commonly reported among
