the levites the priests my ministers as the host of heaven cannot be numbered neither the sand of the sea measured so will i multiply the seed of david my servant and the levites that minister unto me moreover the word of the lord came to jeremiah saying considerest thou not what this people have spoken saying the two families which the lord hath chosen he hath even cast them off thus they have despised my people that they should be no more a nation before them thus saith the lord if my covenant be not with day and night and if i have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth then will i cast away the seed of jacob and david my servant so that i will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of abraham isaac and jacob for i will cause their captivity to return and have mercy on them the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord when nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion and all the people fought against jerusalem and against all the cities thereof saying thus saith the lord the god of israel go and speak to zedekiah king of judah and tell him thus saith the lord behold i will give this city into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall burn it with fire and thou shalt not escape out of his hand but shalt surely be taken and delivered into his hand and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of babylon and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth and thou shalt go to babylon yet hear the word of the lord o zedekiah king of judah thus saith the lord of thee thou shalt not die by the sword but thou shalt die in peace and with the burnings of thy fathers the former kings which were before thee so shall they burn odours for thee and they will lament thee saying ah lord for i have pronounced the word saith the lord then jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto zedekiah king of judah in jerusalem when the king of babylons army fought against jerusalem and against all the cities of judah that were left against lachish and against azekah for these defenced cities remained of the cities of judah this is the word that came unto jeremiah from the lord after that the king zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at jerusalem to proclaim liberty unto them that every man should let his manservant and every man his maidservant being an hebrew or an hebrewess go free that none should serve himself of them to wit of a jew his brother now when all the princes and all the people which had entered into the covenant heard that every one should let his manservant and every one his maidservant go free that none should serve themselves of them any more then they obeyed and let them go but afterward they turned and caused the servants and the handmaids whom they had let go free to return and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids therefore the word of the lord came to jeremiah from the lord saying thus saith the lord the god of israel i made a covenant with your fathers in the day that i brought them forth out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondmen saying at the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an hebrew which hath been sold unto thee and when he hath served thee six years thou shalt let him go free from thee but your fathers hearkened not unto me neither inclined their ear and ye were now turned and had done right in my sight in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name but ye turned and polluted my name and caused every man his servant and every man his handmaid whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasure to return and brought them into subjection to be unto you for servants and for handmaids therefore thus saith the lord ye have not hearkened unto me in proclaiming liberty every one to his brother and every man to his neighbour behold i proclaim a liberty for you saith the lord to the sword to the pestilence and to the famine and i will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth and i will give the men that have transgressed my covenant which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me when they cut the calf in twain and passed between the parts thereof the princes of judah and the princes of jerusalem the eunuchs and the priests and all the people of the land which passed between the parts of the calf i will even give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of them that seek their life and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven and to the beasts of the earth and zedekiah king of judah and his princes will i give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of them that seek their life and into the hand of the king of babylons army which are gone up from you behold i will command saith the lord and cause them to return to this city and they shall fight against it and take it and burn it with fire and i will make the cities of judah a desolation without an inhabitant the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord in the days of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah saying go unto the house of the rechabites and speak unto them and bring them into the house of the lord into one of the chambers and give them wine to drink then i took jaazaniah the son of jeremiah the son of habaziniah and his brethren and all his sons and the whole house of the rechabites and i brought them into the
