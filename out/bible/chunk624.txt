hear them and he said nay father abraham but if one went unto them from the dead they will repent and he said unto him if they hear not moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead then said he unto the disciples it is impossible but that offences will come but woe unto him through whom they come it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he cast into the sea than that he should offend one of these little ones take heed to yourselves if thy brother trespass against thee rebuke him and if he repent forgive him and if he trespass against thee seven times in a day and seven times in a day turn again to thee saying i repent thou shalt forgive him and the apostles said unto the lord increase our faith and the lord said if ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed ye might say unto this sycamine tree be thou plucked up by the root and be thou planted in the sea and it should obey you but which of you having a servant plowing or feeding cattle will say unto him by and by when he is come from the field go and sit down to meat and will not rather say unto him make ready wherewith i may sup and gird thyself and serve me till i have eaten and drunken and afterward thou shalt eat and drink doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him i trow not so likewise ye when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you say we are unprofitable servants we have done that which was our duty to do and it came to pass as he went to jerusalem that he passed through the midst of samaria and galilee and as he entered into a certain village there met him ten men that were lepers which stood afar off and they lifted up their voices and said jesus master have mercy on us and when he saw them he said unto them go shew yourselves unto the priests and it came to pass that as they went they were cleansed and one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back and with a loud voice glorified god and fell down on his face at his feet giving him thanks and he was a samaritan and jesus answering said were there not ten cleansed but where are the nine there are not found that returned to give glory to god save this stranger and he said unto him arise go thy way thy faith hath made thee whole and when he was demanded of the pharisees when the kingdom of god should come he answered them and said the kingdom of god cometh not with observation neither shall they say lo here or lo there for behold the kingdom of god is within you and he said unto the disciples the days will come when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man and ye shall not see it and they shall say to you see here or see there go not after them nor follow them for as the lightning that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven shineth unto the other part under heaven so shall also the son of man be in his day but first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation and as it was in the days of noe so shall it be also in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that noe entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed in that day he which shall be upon the housetop and his stuff in the house let him not come down to take it away and he that is in the field let him likewise not return back remember lots wife whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it i tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed the one shall be taken and the other shall be left two women shall be grinding together the one shall be taken and the other left two men shall be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left and they answered and said unto him where lord and he said unto them wheresoever the body is thither will the eagles be gathered together and he spake a parable unto them to this end that men ought always to pray and not to faint saying there was in a city a judge which feared not god neither regarded man and there was a widow in that city and she came unto him saying avenge me of mine adversary and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though i fear not god nor regard man yet because this widow troubleth me i will avenge her lest by her continual coming she weary me and the lord said hear what the unjust judge saith and shall not god avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with them i tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth and he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others two men went up into the temple to pray the one a pharisee and the other a publican the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself god i thank thee that i am not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this publican i fast twice in
