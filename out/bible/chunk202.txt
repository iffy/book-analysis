lords priests and david said unto abiathar i knew it that day when doeg the edomite was there that he would surely tell saul i have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy fathers house abide thou with me fear not for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life but with me thou shalt be in safeguard then they told david saying behold the philistines fight against keilah and they rob the threshingfloors therefore david enquired of the lord saying shall i go and smite these philistines and the lord said unto david go and smite the philistines and save keilah and davids men said unto him behold we be afraid here in judah how much more then if we come to keilah against the armies of the philistines then david enquired of the lord yet again and the lord answered him and said arise go down to keilah for i will deliver the philistines into thine hand so david and his men went to keilah and fought with the philistines and brought away their cattle and smote them with a great slaughter so david saved the inhabitants of keilah and it came to pass when abiathar the son of ahimelech fled to david to keilah that he came down with an ephod in his hand and it was told saul that david was come to keilah and saul said god hath delivered him into mine hand for he is shut in by entering into a town that hath gates and bars and saul called all the people together to war to go down to keilah to besiege david and his men and david knew that saul secretly practised mischief against him and he said to abiathar the priest bring hither the ephod then said david o lord god of israel thy servant hath certainly heard that saul seeketh to come to keilah to destroy the city for my sake will the men of keilah deliver me up into his hand will saul come down as thy servant hath heard o lord god of israel i beseech thee tell thy servant and the lord said he will come down then said david will the men of keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of saul and the lord said they will deliver thee up then david and his men which were about six hundred arose and departed out of keilah and went whithersoever they could go and it was told saul that david was escaped from keilah and he forbare to go forth and david abode in the wilderness in strong holds and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of ziph and saul sought him every day but god delivered him not into his hand and david saw that saul was come out to seek his life and david was in the wilderness of ziph in a wood and jonathan sauls son arose and went to david into the wood and strengthened his hand in god and he said unto him fear not for the hand of saul my father shall not find thee and thou shalt be king over israel and i shall be next unto thee and that also saul my father knoweth and they two made a covenant before the lord and david abode in the wood and jonathan went to his house then came up the ziphites to saul to gibeah saying doth not david hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood in the hill of hachilah which is on the south of jeshimon now therefore o king come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down and our part shall be to deliver him into the kings hand and saul said blessed be ye of the lord for ye have compassion on me go i pray you prepare yet and know and see his place where his haunt is and who hath seen him there for it is told me that he dealeth very subtilly see therefore and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself and come ye again to me with the certainty and i will go with you and it shall come to pass if he be in the land that i will search him out throughout all the thousands of judah and they arose and went to ziph before saul but david and his men were in the wilderness of maon in the plain on the south of jeshimon saul also and his men went to seek him and they told david wherefore he came down into a rock and abode in the wilderness of maon and when saul heard that he pursued after david in the wilderness of maon and saul went on this side of the mountain and david and his men on that side of the mountain and david made haste to get away for fear of saul for saul and his men compassed david and his men round about to take them but there came a messenger unto saul saying haste thee and come for the philistines have invaded the land wherefore saul returned from pursuing after david and went against the philistines therefore they called that place selahammahlekoth and david went up from thence and dwelt in strong holds at engedi and it came to pass when saul was returned from following the philistines that it was told him saying behold david is in the wilderness of engedi then saul took three thousand chosen men out of all israel and went to seek david and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats and he came to the sheepcotes by the way where was a cave and saul went in to cover his feet and david and his men remained in the sides of the cave and the men of david said unto him behold the day of which the lord said unto thee behold i will deliver thine enemy into thine hand that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee then david arose and cut off the skirt of sauls robe privily and it came to pass afterward that davids heart smote him because he had cut off sauls skirt and he said unto his men the lord forbid that i should do this thing unto my master the lords anointed
