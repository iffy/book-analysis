seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed and they fed in a meadow and behold seven other kine came up after them out of the river ill favoured and leanfleshed and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river and the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine so pharaoh awoke and he slept and dreamed the second time and behold seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk rank and good and behold seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them and the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears and pharaoh awoke and behold it was a dream and it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled and he sent and called for all the magicians of egypt and all the wise men thereof and pharaoh told them his dream but there was none that could interpret them unto pharaoh then spake the chief butler unto pharaoh saying i do remember my faults this day pharaoh was wroth with his servants and put me in ward in the captain of the guards house both me and the chief baker and we dreamed a dream in one night i and he we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream and there was there with us a young man an hebrew servant to the captain of the guard and we told him and he interpreted to us our dreams to each man according to his dream he did interpret and it came to pass as he interpreted to us so it was me he restored unto mine office and him he hanged then pharaoh sent and called joseph and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon and he shaved himself and changed his raiment and came in unto pharaoh and pharaoh said unto joseph i have dreamed a dream and there is none that can interpret it and i have heard say of thee that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it and joseph answered pharaoh saying it is not in me god shall give pharaoh an answer of peace and pharaoh said unto joseph in my dream behold i stood upon the bank of the river and behold there came up out of the river seven kine fatfleshed and well favoured and they fed in a meadow and behold seven other kine came up after them poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed such as i never saw in all the land of egypt for badness and the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine and when they had eaten them up it could not be known that they had eaten them but they were still ill favoured as at the beginning so i awoke and i saw in my dream and behold seven ears came up in one stalk full and good and behold seven ears withered thin and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them and the thin ears devoured the seven good ears and i told this unto the magicians but there was none that could declare it to me and joseph said unto pharaoh the dream of pharaoh is one god hath shewed pharaoh what he is about to do the seven good kine are seven years and the seven good ears are seven years the dream is one and the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine this is the thing which i have spoken unto pharaoh what god is about to do he sheweth unto pharaoh behold there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of egypt and there shall arise after them seven years of famine and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of egypt and the famine shall consume the land and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following for it shall be very grievous and for that the dream was doubled unto pharaoh twice it is because the thing is established by god and god will shortly bring it to pass now therefore let pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise and set him over the land of egypt let pharaoh do this and let him appoint officers over the land and take up the fifth part of the land of egypt in the seven plenteous years and let them gather all the food of those good years that come and lay up corn under the hand of pharaoh and let them keep food in the cities and that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of egypt that the land perish not through the famine and the thing was good in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants and pharaoh said unto his servants can we find such a one as this is a man in whom the spirit of god is and pharaoh said unto joseph forasmuch as god hath shewed thee all this there is none so discreet and wise as thou art thou shalt be over my house and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled only in the throne will i be greater than thou and pharaoh said unto joseph see i have set thee over all the land of egypt and pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon josephs hand and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had and they cried before him bow the knee and he made him ruler over all the land of egypt and pharaoh said unto joseph i am pharaoh and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of egypt and pharaoh called josephs name zaphnathpaaneah and he gave him to wife asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on and joseph went out over all the land of egypt and joseph was thirty years old when he
