few so there went up thither of the people about three thousand men and they fled before the men of ai and the men of ai smote of them about thirty and six men for they chased them from before the gate even unto shebarim and smote them in the going down wherefore the hearts of the people melted and became as water and joshua rent his clothes and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the lord until the eventide he and the elders of israel and put dust upon their heads and joshua said alas o lord god wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over jordan to deliver us into the hand of the amorites to destroy us would to god we had been content and dwelt on the other side jordan o lord what shall i say when israel turneth their backs before their enemies for the canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it and shall environ us round and cut off our name from the earth and what wilt thou do unto thy great name and the lord said unto joshua get thee up wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face israel hath sinned and they have also transgressed my covenant which i commanded them for they have even taken of the accursed thing and have also stolen and dissembled also and they have put it even among their own stuff therefore the children of israel could not stand before their enemies but turned their backs before their enemies because they were accursed neither will i be with you any more except ye destroy the accursed from among you up sanctify the people and say sanctify yourselves against to morrow for thus saith the lord god of israel there is an accursed thing in the midst of thee o israel thou canst not stand before thine enemies until ye take away the accursed thing from among you in the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes and it shall be that the tribe which the lord taketh shall come according to the families thereof and the family which the lord shall take shall come by households and the household which the lord shall take shall come man by man and it shall be that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire he and all that he hath because he hath transgressed the covenant of the lord and because he hath wrought folly in israel so joshua rose up early in the morning and brought israel by their tribes and the tribe of judah was taken and he brought the family of judah and he took the family of the zarhites and he brought the family of the zarhites man by man and zabdi was taken and he brought his household man by man and achan the son of carmi the son of zabdi the son of zerah of the tribe of judah was taken and joshua said unto achan my son give i pray thee glory to the lord god of israel and make confession unto him and tell me now what thou hast done hide it not from me and achan answered joshua and said indeed i have sinned against the lord god of israel and thus and thus have i done when i saw among the spoils a goodly babylonish garment and two hundred shekels of silver and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight then i coveted them and took them and behold they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent and the silver under it so joshua sent messengers and they ran unto the tent and behold it was hid in his tent and the silver under it and they took them out of the midst of the tent and brought them unto joshua and unto all the children of israel and laid them out before the lord and joshua and all israel with him took achan the son of zerah and the silver and the garment and the wedge of gold and his sons and his daughters and his oxen and his asses and his sheep and his tent and all that he had and they brought them unto the valley of achor and joshua said why hast thou troubled us the lord shall trouble thee this day and all israel stoned him with stones and burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones and they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day so the lord turned from the fierceness of his anger wherefore the name of that place was called the valley of achor unto this day and the lord said unto joshua fear not neither be thou dismayed take all the people of war with thee and arise go up to ai see i have given into thy hand the king of ai and his people and his city and his land and thou shalt do to ai and her king as thou didst unto jericho and her king only the spoil thereof and the cattle thereof shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves lay thee an ambush for the city behind it so joshua arose and all the people of war to go up against ai and joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour and sent them away by night and he commanded them saying behold ye shall lie in wait against the city even behind the city go not very far from the city but be ye all ready and i and all the people that are with me will approach unto the city and it shall come to pass when they come out against us as at the first that we will flee before them for they will come out after us till we have drawn them from the city for they will say they flee before us as at the first therefore we will flee before them then ye shall rise up from the ambush and seize upon the city for the lord your god will deliver it into your hand and it shall be when ye have taken the city that ye shall set the city on fire according to the commandment of the lord shall ye
