more out with us to battle that thou quench not the light of israel and it came to pass after this that there was again a battle with the philistines at gob then sibbechai the hushathite slew saph which was of the sons of the giant and there was again a battle in gob with the philistines where elhanan the son of jaareoregim a bethlehemite slew the brother of goliath the gittite the staff of whose spear was like a weavers beam and there was yet a battle in gath where was a man of great stature that had on every hand six fingers and on every foot six toes four and twenty in number and he also was born to the giant and when he defied israel jonathan the son of shimeah the brother of david slew him these four were born to the giant in gath and fell by the hand of david and by the hand of his servants and david spake unto the lord the words of this song in the day that the lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies and out of the hand of saul and he said the lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer the god of my rock in him will i trust he is my shield and the horn of my salvation my high tower and my refuge my saviour thou savest me from violence i will call on the lord who is worthy to be praised so shall i be saved from mine enemies when the waves of death compassed me the floods of ungodly men made me afraid the sorrows of hell compassed me about the snares of death prevented me in my distress i called upon the lord and cried to my god and he did hear my voice out of his temple and my cry did enter into his ears then the earth shook and trembled the foundations of heaven moved and shook because he was wroth there went up a smoke out of his nostrils and fire out of his mouth devoured coals were kindled by it he bowed the heavens also and came down and darkness was under his feet and he rode upon a cherub and did fly and he was seen upon the wings of the wind and he made darkness pavilions round about him dark waters and thick

and discomfited them and the channels of the sea appeared the foundations of the world were discovered at the rebuking of the lord at the blast of the breath of his nostrils he sent from above he took me he drew me out of many waters he delivered me from my strong enemy and from them that hated me for they were too strong for me they prevented me in the day of my calamity but the lord was my stay he brought me forth also into a large place he delivered me because he delighted in me the lord rewarded me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me for i have kept the ways of the lord and have not wickedly departed from my god for all his judgments were before me and as for his statutes i did not depart from them i was also upright before him and have kept myself from mine iniquity therefore the lord hath recompensed me according to my righteousness according to my cleanness in his eye sight with the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful and with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright with the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury and the afflicted people thou wilt save

power and he maketh my way perfect he maketh my feet like hinds feet and setteth me upon my high places he teacheth my hands to war so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation and thy gentleness hath made me great thou hast enlarged my steps under me so that my feet did not slip i have pursued mine enemies and destroyed them and turned not
