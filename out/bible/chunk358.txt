i shall not be moved therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoiceth my flesh also shall rest in hope for thou wilt not leave my soul in hell neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption thou wilt shew me the path of life in thy presence is fulness of joy at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore hear the right o lord attend unto my cry give ear unto my prayer that goeth not out of feigned lips let my sentence come forth from thy presence let thine eyes behold the things that are equal thou hast proved mine heart thou hast visited me in the night thou hast tried

paths that my footsteps slip not i have called upon thee for thou wilt hear me o god incline thine ear unto me and hear my speech shew thy marvellous lovingkindness o thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them keep me as the apple of the eye hide me under the shadow of thy wings from the wicked that oppress me from my deadly enemies who compass me about they are inclosed in their own fat with their mouth they speak proudly they have now compassed us in our steps they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth like as a lion that is greedy of his prey and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places arise o lord disappoint him cast him down deliver my soul from the wicked which is thy sword from men which are thy hand o lord from men of the world which have their portion in this life and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure they are full of children and leave the rest of their substance to their babes as for me i will behold thy face in righteousness i shall be satisfied when i awake with thy likeness i will love thee o lord my strength the lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer my god my strength in whom i will trust my buckler and the horn of my salvation and my high tower i will call upon the lord who is worthy to be praised so shall i be saved from mine enemies the sorrows of death compassed me and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid the sorrows of hell compassed me about the snares of death prevented me in my distress i called upon the lord and cried unto my god he heard my voice out of his temple and my cry came before him even into his ears then the earth shook and trembled the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken because he was wroth there went up a smoke out of his nostrils and fire out of his mouth devoured coals were kindled by it he bowed the heavens also and came down and darkness was under his feet and he rode upon a cherub and did fly yea he did fly upon the wings of the wind he made darkness his secret place his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies at the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed hail stones and coals of fire the lord also thundered in the heavens and the highest gave his voice hail stones and coals of fire yea he sent out his arrows and scattered them and he shot out lightnings and discomfited them then the channels of waters were seen and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke o lord at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils he sent from above he took me he drew me out of many waters he delivered me from my strong enemy and from them which hated me for they were too strong for me they prevented me in the day of my calamity but the lord was my stay he brought me forth also into a large place he delivered me because he delighted in me the lord rewarded me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me for i have kept the ways of the lord and have not wickedly departed from my god for all his judgments were before me and i did not put away his statutes from me i was also upright before him and i kept myself from mine iniquity therefore hath the lord recompensed me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight with the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright with the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward for thou wilt save the afflicted people but wilt bring down high looks for thou wilt light my candle the lord my god will enlighten my darkness for by thee i have run through a troop and by my god have i leaped over a wall as for god his way is perfect the word of the lord is tried he is a buckler to all those that trust in him for who is god save the lord or who is a rock save our god it is god that girdeth me with strength and maketh my way perfect he maketh my feet like hinds feet and setteth me upon my high places he teacheth my hands to war so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation and thy right hand hath holden me up and thy gentleness hath made me great thou hast enlarged my steps under me that my feet did not slip i have pursued mine enemies and overtaken them neither did i turn again till they were consumed i have wounded them that they were not able to rise they are fallen under my feet for thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle
