return but not to the most high they are like a deceitful bow their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue this shall be their derision in the land of egypt set the trumpet to thy mouth he shall come as an eagle against the house of the lord because they have transgressed my covenant and trespassed against my law israel shall cry unto me my god we know thee israel hath cast off the thing that is good the enemy shall pursue him they have set up kings but not by me they have made princes and i knew it not of their silver and their gold have they made them idols that they may be cut off thy calf o samaria hath cast thee off mine anger is kindled against them how long will it be ere they attain to innocency for from israel was it also the workman made it therefore it is not god but the calf of samaria shall be broken in pieces for they have sown the wind and they shall reap the whirlwind it hath no stalk the bud shall yield no meal if so be it yield the strangers shall swallow it up israel is swallowed up now shall they be among the gentiles as a vessel wherein is no pleasure for they are gone up to assyria a wild ass alone by himself ephraim hath hired lovers yea though they have hired among the nations now will i gather them and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes because ephraim hath made many altars to sin altars shall be unto him to sin i have written to him the great things of my law but they were counted as a strange thing they sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings and eat it but the lord accepteth them not now will he remember their iniquity and visit their sins they shall return to egypt for israel hath forgotten his maker and buildeth temples and judah hath multiplied fenced cities but i will send a fire upon his cities and it shall devour the palaces thereof rejoice not o israel for joy as other people for thou hast gone a whoring from thy god thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloor the floor and the winepress shall not feed them and the new wine shall fail in her they shall not dwell in the lords land but ephraim shall return to egypt and they shall eat unclean things in assyria they shall not offer wine offerings to the lord neither shall they be pleasing unto him their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners all that eat thereof shall be polluted for their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the lord what will ye do in the solemn day and in the day of the feast of the lord for lo they are gone because of destruction egypt shall gather them up memphis shall bury them the pleasant places for their silver nettles shall possess them thorns shall be in their tabernacles the days of visitation are come the days of recompence are come israel shall know it the prophet is a fool the spiritual man is mad for the multitude of thine iniquity and the great hatred the watchman of ephraim was with my god but the prophet is a snare of a fowler in all his ways and hatred in the house of his god they have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of gibeah therefore he will remember their iniquity he will visit their sins i found israel like grapes in the wilderness i saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time but they went to baalpeor and separated themselves unto that shame and their abominations were according as they loved as for ephraim their glory shall fly away like a bird from the birth and from the womb and from the conception though they bring up their children yet will i bereave them that there shall not be a man left yea woe also to them when i depart from them ephraim as i saw tyrus is planted in a pleasant place but ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer give them o lord what wilt thou give give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts all their wickedness is in gilgal for there i hated them for the wickedness of their doings i will drive them out of mine house i will love them no more all their princes are revolters ephraim is smitten their root is dried up they shall bear no fruit yea though they bring forth yet will i slay even the beloved fruit of their womb my god will cast them away because they did not hearken unto him and they shall be wanderers among the nations israel is an empty vine he bringeth forth fruit unto himself according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images their heart is divided now shall they be found faulty he shall break down their altars he shall spoil their images for now they shall say we have no king because we feared not the lord what then should a king do to us they have spoken words swearing falsely in making a covenant thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field the inhabitants of samaria shall fear because of the calves of bethaven for the people thereof shall mourn over it and the priests thereof that rejoiced on it for the glory thereof because it is departed from it it shall be also carried unto assyria for a present to king jareb ephraim shall receive shame and israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel as for samaria her king is cut off as the foam upon the water the high places also of aven the sin of israel shall be destroyed the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars and they shall say to the mountains cover us and to the hills fall on us o israel thou hast sinned from the days of gibeah there they stood the battle
