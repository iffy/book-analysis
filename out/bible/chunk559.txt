the top of all the streets and they cast lots for her honourable men and all her great men were bound in chains thou also shalt be drunken thou shalt be hid thou also shalt seek strength because of the enemy all thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with the firstripe figs if they be shaken they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater behold thy people in the midst of thee are women the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies the fire shall devour thy bars draw thee waters for the siege fortify thy strong holds go into clay and tread the morter make strong the brickkiln there shall the fire devour thee the sword shall cut thee off it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm make thyself many as the cankerworm make thyself many as the locusts thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven the cankerworm spoileth and fleeth away thy crowned are as the locusts and thy captains as the great grasshoppers which camp in the hedges in the cold day but when the sun ariseth they flee away and their place is not known where they are thy shepherds slumber o king of assyria thy nobles shall dwell in the dust thy people is scattered upon the mountains and no man gathereth them there is no healing of thy bruise thy wound is grievous all that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually habakkuk the burden which habakkuk the prophet did see o lord how long shall i cry and thou wilt not hear even cry out unto thee of violence and thou wilt not save why dost thou shew me iniquity and cause me to behold grievance for spoiling and violence are before me and there are that raise up strife and contention therefore the law is slacked and judgment doth never go forth for the wicked doth compass about the righteous therefore wrong judgment proceedeth behold ye among the heathen and regard and wonder marvelously for i will work a work in your days which ye will not believe though it be told you for lo i raise up the chaldeans that bitter and hasty nation which shall march through the breadth of the land to possess the dwellingplaces that are not theirs they are terrible and dreadful their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves their horses also are swifter than the leopards and are more fierce than the evening wolves and their horsemen shall spread themselves and their horsemen shall come from far they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat they shall come all for violence their faces shall sup up as the east wind and they shall gather the captivity as the sand and they shall scoff at the kings and the princes shall be a scorn unto them they shall deride every strong hold for they shall heap dust and take it then shall his mind change and he shall pass over and offend imputing this his power unto his god art thou not from everlasting o lord my god mine holy one we shall not die o lord thou hast ordained them for judgment and o mighty god thou hast established them for correction thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil and canst not look on iniquity wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he and makest men as the fishes of the sea as the creeping things that have no ruler over them they take up all of them with the angle they catch them in their net and gather them in their drag therefore they rejoice and are glad therefore they sacrifice unto their net and burn incense unto their drag because by them their portion is fat and their meat plenteous shall they therefore empty their net and not spare continually to slay the nations i will stand upon my watch and set me upon the tower and will watch to see what he will say unto me and what i shall answer when i am reproved and the lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it tarry wait for it because it will surely come it will not tarry behold his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him but the just shall live by his faith yea also because he transgresseth by wine he is a proud man neither keepeth at home who enlargeth his desire as hell and is as death and cannot be satisfied but gathereth unto him all nations and heapeth unto him all people shall not all these take up a parable against him and a taunting proverb against him and say woe to him that increaseth that which is not his how long and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee and awake that shall vex thee and thou shalt be for booties unto them because thou hast spoiled many nations all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee because of mens blood and for the violence of the land of the city and of all that dwell therein woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house that he may set his nest on high that he may be delivered from the power of evil thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people and hast sinned against thy soul for the stone shall cry out of the wall and the beam out of the timber shall answer it woe to him that buildeth a town with blood and stablisheth a city by iniquity behold is it not of the lord of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity for the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the lord as the waters cover the sea woe unto
