the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over that they turn not again to cover the earth he sendeth the springs into the valleys which run among the hills they give drink to every beast of the field the wild asses quench their thirst by them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation which sing among the branches he watereth the hills from his chambers the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works he causeth the grass to grow for the cattle and herb for the service of man that he may bring forth food out of the earth

where the birds make their nests as for the stork the fir trees are her house the high hills are a refuge for the wild goats and the rocks for the conies he appointed the moon for seasons the sun knoweth his going down thou makest darkness and it is night wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth the young lions roar after their prey and seek their meat from god the sun ariseth they gather themselves together and lay them down in their dens man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening o lord how manifold are thy works in wisdom hast thou made them all the earth is full of thy riches so is this great and wide sea wherein are things creeping innumerable both small and great beasts there go the ships there is that leviathan whom thou hast made to play therein these wait all upon thee that thou mayest give them their meat in due season that thou givest them they gather thou openest thine hand they are filled with good thou hidest thy face they are troubled thou takest away their breath they die and return to their dust thou sendest forth thy spirit they are created and thou renewest the face of the earth the glory of the lord shall endure for

lot of your inheritance when they were but a few men in number yea very few and strangers in it when they went from one nation to another from one kingdom to another people he suffered no man to do them wrong yea he reproved kings for their sakes saying touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm moreover he called for a famine upon the land he brake the whole staff of bread he sent a man before them even joseph who was sold for a servant whose feet they hurt with fetters he was laid in iron until the time that his word came the word of the lord tried him the king sent and loosed him

egypt and jacob sojourned in the land of ham and he increased his people greatly and made them stronger than their enemies he turned their heart to hate his people to deal subtilly with his servants he sent moses his servant and aaron whom he had chosen they shewed his signs among them and wonders in the land of ham he sent darkness and made it dark and they rebelled not against his word he turned their waters into blood and slew their fish their land brought forth frogs in abundance in the chambers of their kings he spake and there came divers sorts of flies and lice in all their coasts he gave them hail for rain and flaming fire in their land he smote their vines also and their fig trees and brake the trees of their coasts he spake and the locusts came and caterpillers and that without number and did eat up all the herbs in their land and devoured the fruit of their ground he smote also all the firstborn in their land the chief of all their strength he brought them forth also with silver and gold and there was not one feeble person among their tribes egypt was glad when they departed for the fear of them fell upon them he spread a cloud for a covering and fire to give light in the night the people asked and he brought quails and satisfied them with the bread of heaven he opened the rock and the waters gushed out they ran in the dry places like a river for he remembered his holy promise and abraham his servant and he brought forth his people with joy
