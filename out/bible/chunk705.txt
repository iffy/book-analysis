you for the same purpose that he might know your estate and comfort your hearts with onesimus a faithful and beloved brother who is one of you they shall make known unto you all things which are done

beloved physician and demas greet you salute the brethren which are in laodicea and nymphas and the church which is in his house and when this epistle is read among you cause that it be read also in the church of the laodiceans and that ye likewise read the epistle from laodicea and say to archippus take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the lord that thou fulfil it the salutation by the hand of me paul remember my bonds grace be with you amen the first epistle of paul the apostle to the thessalonians paul and silvanus and timotheus unto the church of the thessalonians which is in god the father and in the lord jesus christ grace be unto you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ we give thanks to god always for you all making mention of you in our prayers remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labour of love and patience of hope in our lord jesus christ in the sight of god and our father knowing brethren beloved your election of god for our gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the holy ghost and in much assurance as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake and ye became followers of us and of the lord having received the word in much affliction with joy of the holy ghost so that ye were ensamples to all that believe in macedonia and achaia for from you sounded out the word of the lord not only in macedonia and achaia but also in every place your faith to god-ward is spread abroad so that we need not to speak any thing for they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you and how ye turned to god from idols to serve the living and true god and to wait for his son from heaven whom he raised from the dead even jesus which delivered us from the wrath to come for yourselves brethren know our entrance in unto you that it was not in vain but even after that we had suffered before and were shamefully entreated as ye know at philippi we were bold in our god to speak unto you the gospel of god with much contention for our exhortation was not of deceit nor of uncleanness nor in guile but as we were allowed of god to be put in trust with the gospel even so we speak not as pleasing men but god which trieth our hearts for neither at any time used we flattering words as ye know nor a cloke of covetousness god is witness nor of men sought we glory neither of you nor yet of others when we might have been burdensome as the apostles of christ but we were gentle among you even as a nurse cherisheth her children so being affectionately desirous of you we were

that believe for ye brethren became followers of the churches of god which in judaea are in christ jesus for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen even as they have of the jews who
