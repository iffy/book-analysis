then shall the father of the damsel and her mother take and bring forth the tokens of the damsels virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate and the damsels father shall say unto the elders i gave my daughter unto this man to wife and he hateth her and lo he hath given occasions of speech against her saying i found not thy daughter a maid and yet these are the tokens of my daughters virginity and they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city and the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him and they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver and give them unto the father of the damsel because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of israel and she shall be his wife he may not put her away all his days but if this thing be true and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her fathers house and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die because she hath wrought folly in israel to play the whore in her fathers house so shalt thou put evil away from among you if a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband then they shall both of them die both the man that lay with the woman and the woman so shalt thou put away evil from israel if a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband and a man find her in the city and lie with her then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city and ye shall stone them with stones that they die the damsel because she cried not being in the city and the man because he hath humbled his neighbours wife so thou shalt put away evil from among you but if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field and the man force her and lie with her then the man only that lay with her shall die but unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death for as when a man riseth against his neighbour and slayeth him even so is this matter for he found her in the field and the betrothed damsel cried and there was none to save her if a man find a damsel that is a virgin which is not betrothed and lay hold on her and lie with her and they be found then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsels father fifty shekels of silver and she shall be his wife because he hath humbled her he may not put her away all his days a man shall not take his fathers wife nor discover his fathers skirt he that is wounded in the stones or hath his privy member cut off shall not enter into the congregation of the lord a bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the lord even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the lord an ammonite or moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the lord even to their tenth generation

god loved thee thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever thou shalt not abhor an edomite for he is thy brother thou shalt not abhor an egyptian because thou wast a stranger in his land the children that are begotten of them shall enter into the congregation of the lord in their third generation when the host goeth forth against thine enemies then keep thee from every wicked thing if there be among you any man that is not clean by reason of uncleanness that chanceth him by night then shall he go abroad out of the camp he shall not come within the camp but it shall be when evening cometh on he shall wash himself with water and when the sun is down he shall come into the camp again thou shalt have a place also without the camp whither thou shalt go forth abroad and thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon and it shall be when thou wilt ease thyself abroad thou shalt dig therewith and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee for the lord
