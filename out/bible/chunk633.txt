all men and needed not that any should testify of man for he knew what was in man there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god nicodemus saith unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mothers womb and be born jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit marvel not that i said unto thee ye must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth so is every one that is born of the spirit nicodemus answered and said unto him how can these things be jesus answered and said unto him art thou a master of israel and knowest not these things verily verily i say unto thee we speak that we do know and testify that we have seen and ye receive not our witness if i have told you earthly things and ye believe not how shall ye believe if i tell you of heavenly things and no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god and this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil for every one that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in god after these things came jesus and his disciples into the land of judaea and there he tarried with them and baptized and john also was baptizing in aenon near to salim because there was much water there and they came and were baptized for john was not yet cast into prison then there arose a question between some of johns disciples and the jews about purifying and they came unto john and said unto him rabbi he that was with thee beyond jordan to whom thou barest witness behold the same baptizeth and all men come to him john answered and said a man can receive nothing except it be given him from heaven ye yourselves bear me witness that i said i am not the christ but that i am sent before him he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegrooms voice this my joy therefore is fulfilled he must increase but i must decrease he that cometh from above is above all he that is of the earth is earthly and speaketh of the earth he that cometh from heaven is above all and what he hath seen and heard that he testifieth and no man receiveth his testimony he that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that god is true for he whom god hath sent speaketh the words of god for god giveth not the spirit by measure unto him the father loveth the son and hath given all things into his hand he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him when therefore the lord knew how the pharisees had heard that jesus made and baptized more disciples than john though jesus himself baptized not but his disciples he left judaea and departed again into galilee and he must needs go through samaria then cometh he to a city of samaria which is called sychar near to the parcel of ground that jacob gave to his son joseph now jacobs well was there jesus therefore being wearied with his journey sat thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour there cometh a woman of samaria to draw water jesus saith unto her give me to drink for his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat then saith the woman of samaria unto him how is it that thou being a jew askest drink of me which am a woman of samaria for the jews have no dealings with the samaritans jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of god and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou wouldest have asked of him and he would have given thee living water the woman saith unto him sir thou hast nothing to draw with and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that living water art thou greater than our father jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up
