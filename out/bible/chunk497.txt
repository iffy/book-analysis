pieces neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth then he said unto me lo i have given thee cows dung for mans dung and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith moreover he said unto me son of man behold i will break the staff of bread in jerusalem and they shall eat bread by weight and with care and they shall drink water by measure and with astonishment that they may want bread and water and be astonied one with another and consume away for their iniquity and thou son of man take thee a sharp knife take thee a barbers razor and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard then take thee balances to weigh and divide the hair thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city when the days of the siege are fulfilled and thou shalt take a third part and smite about it with a knife and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind and i will draw out a sword after them thou shalt also take thereof a few in number and bind them in thy skirts then take of them again and cast them into the midst of the fire and burn them in the fire for thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of israel thus saith the lord god this is jerusalem i have set it in the midst of the nations and countries that are round about her and she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her for they have refused my judgments and my statutes they have not walked in them therefore thus saith the lord god because ye multiplied more than the nations that are round about you and have not walked in my statutes neither have kept my judgments neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you therefore thus saith the lord god behold i even i am against thee and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations and i will do in thee that which i have not done and whereunto i will not do any more the like because of all thine abominations therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee and the sons shall eat their fathers and i will execute judgments in thee and the whole remnant of thee will i scatter into all the winds wherefore as i live saith the lord god surely because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things and with all thine abominations therefore will i also diminish thee neither shall mine eye spare neither will i have any pity a third part of thee shall die with the pestilence and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee and i will scatter a third part into all the winds and i will draw out a sword after them thus shall mine anger be accomplished and i will cause my fury to rest upon them and i will be comforted and they shall know that i the lord have spoken it in my zeal when i have accomplished my fury in them moreover i will make thee waste and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee in the sight of all that pass by so it shall be a reproach and a taunt an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee when i shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes i the lord have spoken it when i shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine which shall be for their destruction and which i will send to destroy you and i will increase the famine upon you and will break your staff of bread so will i send upon you famine and evil beasts and they shall bereave thee and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee and i will bring the sword upon thee i the lord have spoken it and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man set thy face toward the mountains of israel and prophesy against them and say ye mountains of israel hear the word of the lord god thus saith the lord god to the mountains and to the hills to the rivers and to the valleys behold i even i will bring a sword upon you and i will destroy your high places and your altars shall be desolate and your images shall be broken and i will cast down your slain men before your idols and i will lay the dead carcases of the children of israel before their idols and i will scatter your bones round about your altars in all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste and the high places shall be desolate that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate and your idols may be broken and cease and your images may be cut down and your works may be abolished and the slain shall fall in the midst of you and ye shall know that i am the lord yet will i leave a remnant that ye may have some that shall escape the sword among the nations when ye shall be scattered through the countries and they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives because i am broken with their whorish heart which hath departed from me and with their eyes which go a whoring after their idols and they shall lothe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations and they shall know that i am the lord and that i have not said in vain that i would do this evil unto them thus saith the lord god smite with thine hand and stamp with thy foot and say alas for all the evil abominations of the house of israel for they shall fall by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence he that is far off shall die of the pestilence and he
