days of zerubbabel and in the days of nehemiah gave the portions of the singers and the porters every day his portion and they sanctified holy things unto the levites and the levites sanctified them unto the children of aaron on that day they read in the book of moses in the audience of the people and therein was found written that the ammonite and the moabite should not come into the congregation of god for ever because they met not the children of israel with bread and with water but hired balaam against them that he should curse them howbeit our god turned the curse into a blessing now it came to pass when they had heard the law that they separated from israel all the mixed multitude and before this eliashib the priest having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our god was allied unto tobiah and he had prepared for him a great chamber where aforetime they laid the meat offerings the frankincense and the vessels and the tithes of the corn the new wine and the oil which was commanded to be given to the levites and the singers and the porters and the offerings of the priests but in all this time was not i at jerusalem for in the two and thirtieth year of artaxerxes king of babylon came i unto the king and after certain days obtained i leave of the king and i came to jerusalem and understood of the evil that eliashib did for tobiah in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of god and it grieved me sore therefore i cast forth all the household stuff to tobiah out of the chamber then i commanded and they cleansed the chambers and thither brought i again the vessels of the house of god with the meat offering and the frankincense and i perceived that the portions of the levites had not been given them for the levites and the singers that did the work were fled every one to his field then contended i with the rulers and said why is the house of god forsaken and i gathered them together and set them in their place then brought all judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries and i made treasurers over the treasuries shelemiah the priest and zadok the scribe and of the levites pedaiah and next to them was hanan the son of zaccur the son of mattaniah for they were counted faithful and their office was to distribute unto their brethren remember me o my god concerning this and wipe not out my good deeds that i have done for the house of my god and for the offices thereof in those days saw i in judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath and bringing in sheaves and lading asses as also wine grapes and figs and all manner of burdens which they brought into jerusalem on the sabbath day and i testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals there dwelt men of tyre also therein which brought fish and all manner of ware and sold on the sabbath unto the children of judah and in jerusalem then i contended with the nobles of judah and said unto them what evil thing is this that ye do and profane the sabbath day did not your fathers thus and did not our god bring all this evil upon us and upon this city yet ye bring more wrath upon israel by profaning the sabbath and it came to pass that when the gates of jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath i commanded that the gates should be shut and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath and some of my servants set i at the gates that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day so the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without jerusalem once or twice then i testified against them and said unto them why lodge ye about the wall if ye do so again i will lay hands on you from that time forth came they no more on the sabbath and i commanded the levites that they should cleanse themselves and that they should come and keep the gates to sanctify the sabbath day remember me o my god concerning this also and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy in those days also saw i jews that had married wives of ashdod of ammon and of moab and their children spake half in the speech of ashdod and could not speak in the jews language but according to the language of each people and i contended with them and cursed them and smote certain of them and plucked off their hair and made them swear by god saying ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons nor take their daughters unto your sons or for yourselves did not solomon king of israel sin by these things yet among many nations was there no king like him who was beloved of his god and god made him king over all israel nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil to transgress against our god in marrying strange wives and one of the sons of joiada the son of eliashib the high priest was son in law to sanballat the horonite therefore i chased him from me remember them o my god because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and of the levites thus cleansed i them from all strangers and appointed the wards of the priests and the levites every one in his business and for the wood offering at times appointed and for the firstfruits remember me o my god for good the book of esther now it came to pass in the days of ahasuerus this is ahasuerus which reigned from india even unto ethiopia over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces that in those days when the king ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom which was in shushan the palace in the third year of his reign he made a feast unto all
