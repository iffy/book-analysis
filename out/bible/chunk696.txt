they glorified god in me then fourteen years after i went up again to jerusalem with barnabas and took titus with me also and i went up by revelation and communicated unto them that gospel which i preach among the gentiles but privately to them which were of reputation lest by any means i should run or had run in vain but neither titus who was with me being a greek was compelled to be circumcised and that because of false brethren unawares brought in who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in christ jesus that they might bring us into bondage to whom we gave place by subjection no not for an hour that the truth of the gospel might continue with you but of these who seemed to be somewhat whatsoever they were it maketh no matter to me god accepteth no mans person for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me but contrariwise when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me as the gospel of the circumcision was unto peter for he that wrought effectually in peter to the apostleship of the circumcision the same was mighty in me toward the gentiles and when james cephas and john who seemed to be pillars perceived the grace that was given unto me they gave to me and barnabas the right hands of fellowship that we should go unto the heathen and they unto the circumcision only they would that we should remember the poor the same which i also was forward to do but when peter was come to antioch i withstood him to the face because he was to be blamed for before that certain came from james he did eat with the gentiles but when they were come he withdrew and separated himself fearing them which were of the circumcision and the other jews dissembled likewise with him insomuch that barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation but when i saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel i said unto peter before them all if thou being a jew livest after the manner of gentiles and not as do the jews why compellest thou the gentiles to live as do the jews we who are jews by nature and not sinners of the gentiles knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of jesus christ even we have believed in jesus christ that we might be justified by the faith of christ and not by the works of the law for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified but if while we seek to be justified by christ we ourselves also are found sinners is therefore christ the minister of sin god forbid for if i build again the things which i destroyed i make myself a transgressor for i through the law am dead to the law that i might live unto god i am crucified with christ neverthless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me i do not frustrate the grace of god for if righteousness come by the law then christ is dead in vain o foolish galatians who hath bewitched you that ye should not obey the truth before whose eyes jesus christ hath been evidently set forth crucified among you this only would i learn of you received ye the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith are ye so foolish having begun in the spirit are ye now made perfect by the flesh have ye suffered so many things in vain if it be yet in vain he therefore that ministereth to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you doeth he it by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith even as abraham believed god and it was accounted to him for righteousness know ye therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of abraham and the scripture foreseeing that god would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto abraham saying in thee shall all nations be blessed so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful abraham for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse for it is written cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of god it is evident for the just shall live by faith and the law is not of faith but the man that doeth them shall live in them christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree that the blessing of abraham might come on the gentiles through jesus christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith brethren i speak after the manner of men though it be but a mans covenant yet if it be confirmed no man disannulleth or addeth thereto now to abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not and to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is christ and this i say that the covenant that was confirmed before of god in christ the law which was four hundred and thirty years after cannot disannul that it should make the promise of none effect for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more of promise but god gave it to abraham by promise wherefore then serveth the law it was added because of transgressions till the seed should come to whom the promise was made and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator now a mediator is not a mediator of one but god is one is the law then against the promises of god god forbid for if there had been a law
