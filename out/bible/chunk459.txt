children are gone forth of me and they are not there is none to stretch forth my tent any more and to set up my curtains for the pastors are become brutish and have not sought the lord therefore they shall not prosper and all their flocks shall be scattered behold the noise of the bruit is come and a great commotion out of the north country to make the cities of judah desolate and a den of dragons o lord i know that the way of man is not in himself it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps o lord correct me but with judgment not in thine anger lest thou bring me to nothing pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not and upon the families that call not on thy name for they have eaten up jacob and devoured him and consumed him and have made his habitation desolate the word that came to jeremiah from the lord saying hear ye the words of this covenant and speak unto the men of judah and to the inhabitants of jerusalem and say thou unto them thus saith the lord god of israel cursed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant which i commanded your fathers in the day that i brought them forth out of the land of egypt from the iron furnace saying obey my voice and do them according to all which i command you so shall ye be my people and i will be your god that i may perform the oath which i have sworn unto your fathers to give them a land flowing with milk and honey as it is this day then answered i and said so be it o lord then the lord said unto me proclaim all these words in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem saying hear ye the words of this covenant and do them for i earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that i brought them up out of the land of egypt even unto this day rising early and protesting saying obey my voice yet they obeyed not nor inclined their ear but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart therefore i will bring upon them all the words of this covenant which i commanded them to do but they did them not and the lord said unto me a conspiracy is found among the men of judah and among the inhabitants of jerusalem they are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers which refused to hear my words and they went after other gods to serve them the house of israel and the house of judah have broken my covenant which i made with their fathers therefore thus saith the lord behold i will bring evil upon them which they shall not be able to escape and though they shall cry unto me i will not hearken unto them then shall the cities of judah and inhabitants of jerusalem go and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble for according to the number of thy cities were thy gods o judah and according to the number of the streets of jerusalem have ye set up altars to that shameful thing even altars to burn incense unto baal therefore pray not thou for this people neither lift up a cry or prayer for them for i will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble what hath my beloved to do in mine house seeing she hath wrought lewdness with many and the holy flesh is passed from thee when thou doest evil then thou rejoicest the lord called thy name a green olive tree fair and of goodly fruit with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it and the branches of it are broken for the lord of hosts that planted thee hath pronounced evil against thee for the evil of the house of israel and of the house of judah which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense unto baal and the lord hath given me knowledge of it and i know it then thou shewedst me their doings but i was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter and i knew not that they had devised devices against me saying let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof and let us cut him off from the land of the living that his name may be no more remembered but o lord of hosts that judgest righteously that triest the reins and the heart let me see thy vengeance on them for unto thee have i revealed my cause therefore thus saith the lord of the men of anathoth that seek thy life saying prophesy not in the name of the lord that thou die not by our hand therefore thus saith the lord of hosts behold i will punish them the young men shall die by the sword their sons and their daughters shall die by famine and there shall be no remnant of them for i will bring evil upon the men of anathoth even the year of their visitation righteous art thou o lord when i plead with thee yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously thou hast planted them yea they have taken root they grow yea they bring forth fruit thou art near in their mouth and far from their reins but thou o lord knowest me thou hast seen me and tried mine heart toward thee pull them out like sheep for the slaughter and prepare them for the day of slaughter how long shall the land mourn and the herbs of every field wither for the wickedness of them that dwell therein the beasts are consumed and the birds because they said he shall not see our last end if thou hast run with the footmen and they have wearied thee then how canst thou contend with horses and if in the land of peace
