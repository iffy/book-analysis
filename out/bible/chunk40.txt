moses saying i am the lord speak thou unto pharaoh king of egypt all that i say unto thee and moses said before the lord behold i am of uncircumcised lips and how shall pharaoh hearken unto me and the lord said unto moses see i have made thee a god to pharaoh and aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet thou shalt speak all that i command thee and aaron thy brother shall speak unto pharaoh that he send the children of israel out of his land and i will harden pharaohs heart and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of egypt but pharaoh shall not hearken unto you that i may lay my hand upon egypt and bring forth mine armies and my people the children of israel out of the land of egypt by great judgments and the egyptians shall know that i am the lord when i stretch forth mine hand upon egypt and bring out the children of israel from among them and moses and aaron did as the lord commanded them so did they and moses was fourscore years old and aaron fourscore and three years old when they spake unto pharaoh and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying when pharaoh shall speak unto you saying shew a miracle for you then thou shalt say unto aaron take thy rod and cast it before pharaoh and it shall become a serpent and moses and aaron went in unto pharaoh and they did so as the lord had commanded and aaron cast down his rod before pharaoh and before his servants and it became a serpent then pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers now the magicians of egypt they also did in like manner with their enchantments for they cast down every man his rod and they became serpents but aarons rod swallowed up their rods and he hardened pharaohs heart that he hearkened not unto them as the lord had said and the lord said unto moses pharaohs heart is hardened he refuseth to let the people go get thee unto pharaoh in the morning lo he goeth out unto the water and thou shalt stand by the rivers brink against he come and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand and thou shalt say unto him the lord god of the hebrews hath sent me unto thee saying let my people go that they may serve me in the wilderness and behold hitherto thou wouldest not hear thus saith the lord in this thou shalt know that i am the lord behold i will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river and they shall be turned to blood and the fish that is in the river shall die and the river shall stink and the egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river and the lord spake unto moses say unto aaron take thy rod and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of egypt upon their streams upon their rivers and upon their ponds and upon all their pools of water that they may become blood and that there may be blood throughout all the land of egypt both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone and moses and aaron did so as the lord commanded and he lifted up the rod and smote the waters that were in the river in the sight of pharaoh and in the sight of his servants and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood and the fish that was in the river died and the river stank and the egyptians could not drink of the water of the river and there was blood throughout all the land of egypt and the magicians of egypt did so with their enchantments and pharaohs heart was hardened neither did he hearken unto them as the lord had said and pharaoh turned and went into his house neither did he set his heart to this also and all the egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink for they could not drink of the water of the river and seven days were fulfilled after that the lord had smitten the river and the lord spake unto moses go unto pharaoh and say unto him thus saith the lord let my people go that they may serve me and if thou refuse to let them go behold i will smite all thy borders with frogs and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up and come into thine house and into thy bedchamber and upon thy bed and into the house of thy servants and upon thy people and into thine ovens and into thy kneadingtroughs and the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people and upon all thy servants and the lord spake unto moses say unto aaron stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams over the rivers and over the ponds and cause frogs to come up upon the land of egypt and aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of egypt and the frogs came up and covered the land of egypt and the magicians did so with their enchantments and brought up frogs upon the land of egypt then pharaoh called for moses and aaron and said intreat the lord that he may take away the frogs from me and from my people and i will let the people go that they may do sacrifice unto the lord and moses said unto pharaoh glory over me when shall i intreat for thee and for thy servants and for thy people to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses that they may remain in the river only and he said to morrow and he said be it according to thy word that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the lord our god and the frogs shall depart from thee and from thy houses and from thy servants and from thy people they shall remain in the river only and moses and aaron went out from pharaoh and moses cried unto the lord because of the frogs which he had brought against pharaoh and
