his might and the house fell upon the lords and upon all the people that were therein so the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life then his brethren and all the house of his father came down and took him and brought him up and buried him between zorah and eshtaol in the buryingplace of manoah his father and he judged israel twenty years and there was a man of mount ephraim whose name was micah and he said unto his mother the eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee about which thou cursedst and spakest of also in mine ears behold the silver is with me i took it and his mother said blessed be thou of the lord my son and when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother his mother said i had wholly dedicated the silver unto the lord from my hand for my son to make a graven image and a molten image now therefore i will restore it unto thee yet he restored the money unto his mother and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to the founder who made thereof a graven image and a molten image and they were in the house of micah and the man micah had an house of gods and made an ephod and teraphim and consecrated one of his sons who became his priest in those days there was no king in israel but every man did that which was right in his own eyes and there was a young man out of bethlehemjudah of the family of judah who was a levite and he sojourned there and the man departed out of the city from bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place and he came to mount ephraim to the house of micah as he journeyed and micah said unto him whence comest thou and he said unto him i am a levite of bethlehemjudah and i go to sojourn where i may find a place and micah said unto him dwell with me and be unto me a father and a priest and i will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year and a suit of apparel and thy victuals so the levite went in and the levite was content to dwell with the man and the young man was unto him as one of his sons and micah consecrated the levite and the young man became his priest and was in the house of micah then said micah now know i that the lord will do me good seeing i have a levite to my priest in those days there was no king in israel and in those days the tribe of the danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of israel and the children of dan sent of their family five men from their coasts men of valour from zorah and from eshtaol to spy out the land and to search it and they said unto them go search the land who when they came to mount ephraim to the house of micah they lodged there when they were by the house of micah they knew the voice of the young man the levite and they turned in thither and said unto him who brought thee hither and what makest thou in this place and what hast thou here and he said unto them thus and thus dealeth micah with me and hath hired me and i am his priest and they said unto him ask counsel we pray thee of god that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous and the priest said unto them go in peace before the lord is your way wherein ye go then the five men departed and came to laish and saw the people that were therein how they dwelt careless after the manner of the zidonians quiet and secure and there was no magistrate in the land that might put them to shame in any thing and they were far from the zidonians and had no business with any man and they came unto their brethren to zorah and eshtaol and their brethren said unto them what say ye and they said arise that we may go up against them for we have seen the land and behold it is very good and are ye still be not slothful to go and to enter to possess the land when ye go ye shall come unto a people secure and to a large land for god hath given it into your hands a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth and there went from thence of the family of the danites out of zorah and out of eshtaol six hundred men appointed with weapons of war and they went up and pitched in kirjathjearim in judah wherefore they called that place mahanehdan unto this day behold it is behind kirjathjearim and they passed thence unto mount ephraim and came unto the house of micah then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of laish and said unto their brethren do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod and teraphim and a graven image and a molten image now therefore consider what ye have to do and they turned thitherward and came to the house of the young man the levite even unto the house of micah and saluted him and the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war which were of the children of dan stood by the entering of the gate and the five men that went to spy out the land went up and came in thither and took the graven image and the ephod and the teraphim and the molten image and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war and these went into micahs house and fetched the carved image the ephod and the teraphim and the molten image then said the priest unto them what do ye and they said unto
