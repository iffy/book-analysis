that her warfare is accomplished that her iniquity is pardoned for she hath received of the lords hand double for all her sins the voice of him that crieth in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make straight in the desert a highway for our god every valley shall be exalted and every mountain and hill shall be made low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough places plain and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it the voice said cry and he said what shall i cry all flesh is grass and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field the grass withereth the flower fadeth because the spirit of the lord bloweth upon it surely the people is grass the grass withereth the flower fadeth but the word of our god shall stand for ever o zion that bringest good tidings get thee up into the high mountain o jerusalem that bringest good tidings lift up thy voice with strength lift it up be not afraid say unto the cities of judah behold your god behold the lord god will come with strong hand and his arm shall rule for him behold his reward is with him and his work before him he shall feed his flock like a shepherd he shall gather the lambs with his arm and carry them in his bosom and shall gently lead those that are with young who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and meted out heaven with the span and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure and weighed the mountains in scales and the hills in a balance who hath directed the spirit of the lord or being his counsellor hath taught him with whom took he counsel and who instructed him and taught him in the path of judgment and taught him knowledge and shewed to him the way of understanding behold the nations are as a drop of a bucket and are counted as the small dust of the balance behold he taketh up the isles as a very little thing and lebanon is not sufficient to burn nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering all nations before him are as nothing and they are counted to him less than nothing and vanity to whom then will ye liken god or what likeness will ye compare unto him the workman melteth a graven image and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold and casteth silver chains he that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image that shall not be moved have ye not known have ye not heard hath it not been told you from the beginning have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth it is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in that bringeth the princes to nothing he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity yea they shall not be planted yea they shall not be sown yea their stock shall not take root in the earth and he shall also blow upon them and they shall wither and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble to whom then will ye liken me or shall i be equal saith the holy one lift up your eyes on high and behold who hath created these things that bringeth out their host by number he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might for that he is strong in power not one faileth why sayest thou o jacob and speakest o israel my way is hid from the lord and my judgment is passed over from my god hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the everlasting god the lord the creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increaseth strength even the youths shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint keep silence before me o islands and let the people renew their strength let them come near then let them speak let us come near together to judgment who raised up the righteous man from the east called him to his foot gave the nations before him and made him rule over kings he gave them as the dust to his sword and as driven stubble to his bow he pursued them and passed safely even by the way that he had not gone with his feet who hath wrought and done it calling the generations from the beginning i the lord the first and with the last i am he the isles saw it and feared the ends of the earth were afraid drew near and came they helped every one his neighbour and every one said to his brother be of good courage so the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith and he that smootheth with the hammer him that smote the anvil saying it is ready for the sodering and he fastened it with nails that it should not be moved but thou israel art my servant jacob whom i have chosen the seed of abraham my friend thou whom i have taken from the ends of the earth and called thee from the chief men thereof and said unto thee thou art my servant i have chosen thee and not cast thee away fear thou not for i am with thee be not dismayed for i am thy god i will strengthen thee yea i will help thee yea i will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness behold all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded they shall be as nothing
