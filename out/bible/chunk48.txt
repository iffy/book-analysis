day the bread of two days abide ye every man in his place let no man go out of his place on the seventh day so the people rested on the seventh day and the house of israel called the name thereof manna and it was like coriander seed white and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey and moses said this is the thing which the lord commandeth fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations that they may see the bread wherewith i have fed you in the wilderness when i brought you forth from the land of egypt and moses said unto aaron take a pot and put an omer full of manna therein and lay it up before the lord to be kept for your generations as the lord commanded moses so aaron laid it up before the testimony to be kept and the children of israel did eat manna forty years until they came to a land inhabited they did eat manna until they came unto the borders of the land of canaan now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah and all the congregation of the children of israel journeyed from the wilderness of sin after their journeys according to the commandment of the lord and pitched in rephidim and there was no water for the people to drink wherefore the people did chide with moses and said give us water that we may drink and moses said unto them why chide ye with me wherefore do ye tempt the lord and the people thirsted there for water and the people murmured against moses and said wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of egypt to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst and moses cried unto the lord saying what shall i do unto this people they be almost ready to stone me and the lord said unto moses go on before the people and take with thee of the elders of israel and thy rod wherewith thou smotest the river take in thine hand and go behold i will stand before thee there upon the rock in horeb and thou shalt smite the rock and there shall come water out of it that the people may drink and moses did so in the sight of the elders of israel and he called the name of the place massah and meribah because of the chiding of the children of israel and because they tempted the lord saying is the lord among us or not then came amalek and fought with israel in rephidim and moses said unto joshua choose us out men and go out fight with amalek to morrow i will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of god in mine hand so joshua did as moses had said to him and fought with amalek and moses aaron and hur went up to the top of the hill and it came to pass when moses held up his hand that israel prevailed and when he let down his hand amalek prevailed but moses hands were heavy and they took a stone and put it under him and he sat thereon and aaron and hur stayed up his hands the one on the one side and the other on the other side and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun and joshua discomfited amalek and his people with the edge of the sword and the lord said unto moses write this for a memorial in a book and rehearse it in the ears of joshua for i will utterly put out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven and moses built an altar and called the name of it jehovahnissi for he said because the lord hath sworn that the lord will have war with amalek from generation to generation when jethro the priest of midian moses father in law heard of all that god had done for moses and for israel his people and that the lord had brought israel out of egypt then jethro moses father in law took zipporah moses wife after he had sent her back and her two sons of which the name of the one was gershom for he said i have been an alien in a strange land and the name of the other was eliezer for the god of my father said he was mine help and delivered me from the sword of pharaoh and jethro moses father in law came with his sons and his wife unto moses into the wilderness where he encamped at the mount of god and he said unto moses i thy father in law jethro am come unto thee and thy wife and her two sons with her and moses went out to meet his father in law and did obeisance and kissed him and they asked each other of their welfare and they came into the tent and moses told his father in law all that the lord had done unto pharaoh and to the egyptians for israels sake and all the travail that had come upon them by the way and how the lord delivered them and jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the lord had done to israel whom he had delivered out of the hand of the egyptians and jethro said blessed be the lord who hath delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of pharaoh who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the egyptians now i know that the lord is greater than all gods for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them and jethro moses father in law took a burnt offering and sacrifices for god and aaron came and all the elders of israel to eat bread with moses father in law before god and it came to pass on the morrow that moses sat to judge the people and the people stood by moses from the morning unto the evening and when moses father in law saw all that he did to the people he said what is this thing that thou doest to the people why sittest thou thyself alone and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even and
