his villages in israel then shall the people of the lord go down to the gates awake awake deborah awake awake utter a song arise barak and lead thy captivity captive thou son of abinoam then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people the lord made me have dominion over the mighty out of ephraim was there a root of them against amalek after thee benjamin among thy people out of machir came down governors and out of zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer and the princes of issachar were with deborah even issachar and also barak he was sent on foot into the valley for the divisions of reuben there were great thoughts of heart why abodest thou among the sheepfolds to hear the bleatings of the flocks for the divisions of reuben there were great searchings of heart gilead abode beyond jordan and why did dan remain in ships asher continued on the sea shore and abode in his breaches zebulun and naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field the kings came and fought then fought the kings of canaan in taanach by the waters of megiddo they took no gain of money they fought from heaven the stars in their courses fought against sisera the river of kishon swept them away that ancient river the river kishon o my soul thou hast trodden down strength then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings the pransings of their mighty ones curse ye meroz said the angel of the lord curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof because they came not to the help of the lord to the help of the lord against the mighty blessed above women shall jael the wife of heber the kenite be blessed shall she be above women in the tent he asked water and she gave him milk she brought forth butter in a lordly dish she put her hand to the nail and her right hand to the workmens hammer and with the hammer she smote sisera she smote off his head when she had pierced and stricken through his temples at her feet he bowed he fell he lay down at her feet he bowed he fell where he bowed there he fell down dead the mother of sisera looked out at a window and cried through the lattice why is his chariot so long in coming why tarry the wheels of his chariots her wise ladies answered her yea she returned answer to herself have they not sped have they not divided the prey to every man a damsel or two to sisera a prey of divers colours a prey of divers colours of needlework of divers colours of needlework on both sides meet for the necks of them that take the spoil so let all thine enemies perish o lord but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might and the land had rest forty years and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord and the lord delivered them into the hand of midian seven years and the hand of midian prevailed against israel and because of the midianites the children of israel made them the dens which are in the mountains and caves and strong holds and so it was when israel had sown that the midianites came up and the amalekites and the children of the east even they came up against them and they encamped against them and destroyed the increase of the earth till thou come unto gaza and left no sustenance for israel neither sheep nor ox nor ass for they came up with their cattle and their tents and they came as grasshoppers for multitude for both they and their camels were without number and they entered into the land to destroy it and israel was greatly impoverished because of the midianites and the children of israel cried unto the lord and it came to pass when the children of israel cried unto the lord because of the midianites that the lord sent a prophet unto the children of israel which said unto them thus saith the lord god of israel i brought you up from egypt and brought you forth out of the house of bondage and i delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of all that oppressed you and drave them out from before you and gave you their land and i said unto you i am the lord your god fear not the gods of the amorites in whose land ye dwell but ye have not obeyed my voice and there came an angel of the lord and sat under an oak which was in ophrah that pertained unto joash the abiezrite and his son gideon threshed wheat by the winepress to hide it from the midianites and the angel of the lord appeared unto him and said unto him the lord is with thee thou mighty man of valour and gideon said unto him oh my lord if the lord be with us why then is all this befallen us and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of saying did not the lord bring us up from egypt but now the lord hath forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the midianites and the lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might and thou shalt save israel from the hand of the midianites have not i sent thee and he said unto him oh my lord wherewith shall i save israel behold my family is poor in manasseh and i am the least in my fathers house and the lord said unto him surely i will be with thee and thou shalt smite the midianites as one man and he said unto him if now i have found grace in thy sight then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me depart not hence i pray thee until i come unto thee and bring forth my present and set it before thee and he said i will tarry until thou come again and gideon went in and made ready a kid and unleavened
