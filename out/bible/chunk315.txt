and divided them speedily among all the people and afterward they made ready for themselves and for the priests because the priests the sons of aaron were busied in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night therefore the levites prepared for themselves and for the priests the sons of aaron and the singers the sons of asaph were in their place according to the commandment of david and asaph and heman and jeduthun the kings seer and the porters waited at every gate they might not depart from their service for their brethren the levites prepared for them so all the service of the lord was prepared the same day to keep the passover and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the lord according to the commandment of king josiah and the children of israel that were present kept the passover at that time and the feast of unleavened bread seven days and there was no passover like to that kept in israel from the days of samuel the prophet neither did all the kings of israel keep such a passover as josiah kept and the priests and the levites and all judah and israel that were present and the inhabitants of jerusalem in the eighteenth year of the reign of josiah was this passover kept after all this when josiah had prepared the temple necho king of egypt came up to fight against charchemish by euphrates and josiah went out against him but he sent ambassadors to him saying what have i to do with thee thou king of judah i come not against thee this day but against the house wherewith i have war for god commanded me to make haste forbear thee from meddling with god who is with me that he destroy thee not nevertheless josiah would not turn his face from him but disguised himself that he might fight with him and hearkened not unto the words of necho from the mouth of god and came to fight in the valley of megiddo and the archers shot at king josiah and the king said to his servants have me away for i am sore wounded his servants therefore took him out of that chariot and put him in the second chariot that he had and they brought him to jerusalem and he died and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers and all judah and jerusalem mourned for josiah and jeremiah lamented for josiah and all the singing men and the singing women spake of josiah in their lamentations to this day and made them an ordinance in israel and behold they are written in the lamentations now the rest of the acts of josiah and his goodness according to that which was written in the law of the lord and his deeds first and last behold they are written in the book of the kings of israel and judah then the people of the land took jehoahaz the son of josiah and made him king in his fathers stead in jerusalem jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign and he reigned three months in jerusalem and the king of egypt put him down at jerusalem and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold and the king of egypt made eliakim his brother king over judah and jerusalem and turned his name to jehoiakim and necho took jehoahaz his brother and carried him to egypt jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord his god against him came up nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and bound him in fetters to carry him to babylon nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the lord to babylon and put them in his temple at babylon now the rest of the acts of jehoiakim and his abominations which he did and that which was found in him behold they are written in the book of the kings of israel and judah and jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign and he reigned three months and ten days in jerusalem and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord and when the year was expired king nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to babylon with the goodly vessels of the house of the lord and made zedekiah his brother king over judah and jerusalem zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign and reigned eleven years in jerusalem and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord his god and humbled not himself before jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the lord and he also rebelled against king nebuchadnezzar who had made him swear by god but he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart from turning unto the lord god of israel moreover all the chief of the priests and the people transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen and polluted the house of the lord which he had hallowed in jerusalem and the lord god of their fathers sent to them by his messengers rising up betimes and sending because he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling place but they mocked the messengers of god and despised his words and misused his prophets until the wrath of the lord arose

young man or maiden old man or him that stooped for age he gave them all into his hand and all the vessels of the house of god great and small and the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the king and of his princes all these he brought to babylon and they burnt the house of god and brake down the wall of jerusalem and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof and them that had escaped from the sword carried
