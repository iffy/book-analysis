drink waters out of thine own cistern and running waters out of thine own well let thy fountains be dispersed abroad and rivers of waters in the streets let them be only thine own and not strangers with thee let thy fountain be blessed and rejoice with the wife of thy youth let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe let her breasts satisfy thee at all times and be thou ravished always with her love and why wilt thou my son be ravished with a strange woman and embrace the bosom of a stranger for the ways of man are before the eyes of the lord and he pondereth all his goings his own iniquities shall take the wicked himself and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins he shall die without instruction and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray my son if thou be surety for thy friend if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger thou art snared with the words of thy mouth thou art taken with the words of thy mouth do this now my son and deliver thyself when thou art come into the hand of thy friend go humble thyself and make sure thy friend give not sleep to thine eyes nor slumber to thine eyelids deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter and as a bird from the hand of the fowler go to the ant thou sluggard consider her ways and be wise which having no guide overseer or ruler provideth her meat in the summer and gathereth her food in the harvest how long wilt thou sleep o sluggard when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep yet a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to sleep so shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth and thy want as an armed man a naughty person a wicked man walketh with a froward mouth he winketh with his eyes he speaketh with his feet he teacheth with his fingers frowardness is in his heart he deviseth mischief continually he soweth discord therefore shall his calamity come suddenly suddenly shall he be broken without remedy these six things doth the lord hate yea seven are an abomination unto him a proud look a lying tongue and hands that shed innocent blood an heart that deviseth wicked imaginations feet that be swift in running to mischief a false witness that speaketh lies and he that soweth discord among brethren my son keep thy fathers commandment and forsake not the law of thy mother bind them continually upon thine heart and tie them about thy neck when thou goest it shall lead thee when thou sleepest it shall keep thee and when thou awakest it shall talk with thee for the commandment is a lamp and the law is light and reproofs of instruction are the way of life to keep thee from the evil woman from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman lust not after her beauty in thine heart neither let her take thee with her eyelids for by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread and the adultress will hunt for the precious life can a man take fire in his bosom and his clothes not be burned can one go upon hot coals and his feet not be burned so he that goeth in to his neighbours wife whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent men do not despise a thief if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry but if he be found he shall restore sevenfold he shall give all the substance of his house but whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul a wound and dishonour shall he get and his reproach shall not be wiped away for jealousy is the rage of a man therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance he will not regard any ransom neither will he rest content though thou givest many gifts my son keep my words and lay up my commandments with thee keep my commandments and live and my law as the apple of thine eye bind them upon thy fingers write them upon the table of thine heart say unto wisdom thou art my sister and call understanding thy kinswoman that they may keep thee from the strange woman from the stranger which flattereth with her words for at the window of my house i looked through my casement and beheld among the simple ones i discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding passing through the street near her corner and he went the way to her house in the twilight in the evening in the black and dark night and behold there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot and subtil of heart she is loud and stubborn her feet abide not in her house now is she without now in the streets and lieth in wait at every corner so she caught him and kissed him and with an impudent face said unto him i have peace offerings with me this day have i payed my vows therefore came i forth to meet thee diligently to seek thy face and i have found thee i have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry with carved works with fine linen of egypt i have perfumed my bed with myrrh aloes and cinnamon come let us take our fill of love until the morning let us solace ourselves with loves for the goodman is not at home he is gone a long journey he hath taken a bag of money with him and will come home at the day appointed with her much fair speech she caused him to yield with the flattering of her lips she forced him he goeth after her straightway as an ox goeth to the slaughter or as a fool to the correction of the stocks till a dart strike through his liver as a bird hasteth to the snare and knoweth not that it is for his life hearken unto me now therefore o ye children and attend to the words of my mouth let not thine heart decline
