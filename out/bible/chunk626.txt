have kept laid up in a napkin for i feared thee because thou art an austere man thou takest up that thou layedst not down and reapest that thou didst not sow and he saith unto him out of thine own mouth will i judge thee thou wicked servant thou knewest that i was an austere man taking up that i laid not down and reaping that i did not sow wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank that at my coming i might have required mine own with usury and he said unto them that stood by take from him the pound and give it to him that hath ten pounds and they said unto him lord he hath ten pounds for i say unto you that unto every one which hath shall be given and from him that hath not even that he hath shall be taken away from him but those mine enemies which would not that i should reign over them bring hither and slay them before me and when he had thus spoken he went before ascending up to jerusalem and it came to pass when he was come nigh to bethphage and bethany at the mount called the mount of olives he sent two of his disciples saying go ye into the village over against you in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied whereon yet never man sat loose him and bring him hither and if any man ask you why do ye loose him thus shall ye say unto him because the lord hath need of him and they that were sent went their way and found even as he had said unto them and as they were loosing the colt the owners thereof said unto them why loose ye the colt and they said the lord hath need of him and they brought him to jesus and they cast their garments upon the colt and they set jesus thereon and as he went they spread their clothes in the way and when he was come nigh even now at the descent of the mount of olives the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise god with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen saying blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest and some of the pharisees from among the multitude said unto him master rebuke thy disciples and he answered and said unto them i tell you that if these should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out and when he was come near he beheld the city and wept over it saying if thou hadst known even thou at least in this thy day the things which belong unto thy peace but now they are hid from thine eyes for the days shall come upon thee that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee and compass thee round and keep thee in on every side and shall lay thee even with the ground and thy children within thee and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation and he went into the temple and began to cast out them that sold therein and them that bought saying unto them it is written my house is the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves and he taught daily in the temple but the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him and could not find what they might do for all the people were very attentive to hear him and it came to pass that on one of those days as he taught the people in the temple and preached the gospel the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders and spake unto him saying tell us by what authority doest thou these things or who is he that gave thee this authority and he answered and said unto them i will also ask you one thing and answer me the baptism of john was it from heaven or of men and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say why then believed ye him not but and if we say of men all the people will stone us for they be persuaded that john was a prophet and they answered that they could not tell whence it was and jesus said unto them neither tell i you by what authority i do these things then began he to speak to the people this parable a certain man planted a vineyard and let it forth to husbandmen and went into a far country for a long time and at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard but the husbandmen beat him and sent him away empty and again he sent another servant and they beat him also and entreated him shamefully and sent him away empty and again he sent a third and they wounded him also and cast him out then said the lord of the vineyard what shall i do i will send my beloved son it may be they will reverence him when they see him but when the husbandmen saw him they reasoned among themselves saying this is the heir come let us kill him that the inheritance may be ours so they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him what therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them he shall come and destroy these husbandmen and shall give the vineyard to others and when they heard it they said god forbid and he beheld them and said what is this then that is written the stone which the builders rejected the same is become the head of the corner whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder and the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him and they feared the people for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them and
