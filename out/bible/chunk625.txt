the week i give tithes of all that i possess and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying god be merciful to me a sinner i tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted and they brought unto him also infants that he would touch them but when his disciples saw it they rebuked them but jesus called them unto him and said suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of god verily i say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child shall in no wise enter therein and a certain ruler asked him saying good master what shall i do to inherit eternal life and jesus said unto him why callest thou me good none is good save one that is god thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness honour thy father and thy mother and he said all these have i kept from my youth up now when jesus heard these things he said unto him yet lackest thou one thing sell all that thou hast and distribute unto the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come follow me and when he heard this he was very sorrowful for he was very rich and when jesus saw that he was very sorrowful he said how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god for it is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god and they that heard it said who then can be saved and he said the things which are impossible with men are possible with god then peter said lo we have left all and followed thee and he said unto them verily i say unto you there is no man that hath left house or parents or brethren or wife or children for the kingdom of gods sake who shall not receive manifold more in this present time and in the world to come life everlasting then he took unto him the twelve and said unto them behold we go up to jerusalem and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the son of man shall be accomplished for he shall be delivered unto the gentiles and shall be mocked and spitefully entreated and spitted on and they shall scourge him and put him to death and the third day he shall rise again and they understood none of these things and this saying was hid from them neither knew they the things which were spoken and it came to pass that as he was come nigh unto jericho a certain blind man sat by the way side begging and hearing the multitude pass by he asked what it meant and they told him that jesus of nazareth passeth by and he cried saying jesus thou son of david have mercy on me and they which went before rebuked him that he should hold his peace but he cried so much the more thou son of david have mercy on me and jesus stood and commanded him to be brought unto him and when he was come near he asked him saying what wilt thou that i shall do unto thee and he said lord that i may receive my sight and jesus said unto him receive thy sight thy faith hath saved thee and immediately he received his sight and followed him glorifying god and all the people when they saw it gave praise unto god and jesus entered and passed through jericho and behold there was a man named zacchaeus which was the chief among the publicans and he was rich and he sought to see jesus who he was and could not for the press because he was little of stature and he ran before and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him for he was to pass that way and when jesus came to the place he looked up and saw him and said unto him zacchaeus make haste and come down for to day i must abide at thy house and he made haste and came down and received him joyfully and when they saw it they all murmured saying that he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner and zacchaeus stood and said unto the lord behold lord the half of my goods i give to the poor and if i have taken any thing from any man by false accusation i restore him fourfold and jesus said unto him this day is salvation come to this house forsomuch as he also is a son of abraham for the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost and as they heard these things he added and spake a parable because he was nigh to jerusalem and because they thought that the kingdom of god should immediately appear he said therefore a certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return and he called his ten servants and delivered them ten pounds and said unto them occupy till i come but his citizens hated him and sent a message after him saying we will not have this man to reign over us and it came to pass that when he was returned having received the kingdom then he commanded these servants to be called unto him to whom he had given the money that he might know how much every man had gained by trading then came the first saying lord thy pound hath gained ten pounds and he said unto him well thou good servant because thou hast been faithful in a very little have thou authority over ten cities and the second came saying lord thy pound hath gained five pounds and he said likewise to him be thou also over five cities and another came saying lord behold here is thy pound which
