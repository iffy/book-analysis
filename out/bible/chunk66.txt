and it came to pass in the first month in the second year on the first day of the month that the tabernacle was reared up and moses reared up the tabernacle and fastened his sockets and set up the boards thereof and put in the bars thereof and reared up his pillars and he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering of the tent above upon it as the lord commanded moses and he took and put the testimony into the ark and set the staves on the ark and put the mercy seat above upon the ark and he brought the ark into the tabernacle and set up the vail of the covering and covered the ark of the testimony as the lord commanded moses and he put the table in the tent of the congregation upon the side of the tabernacle northward without the vail and he set the bread in order upon it before the lord as the lord had commanded moses and he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation over against the table on the side of the tabernacle southward and he lighted the lamps before the lord as the lord commanded moses and he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail and he burnt sweet incense thereon as the lord commanded moses and he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle and he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering as the lord commanded moses and he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar and put water there to wash withal and moses and aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat when they went into the tent of the congregation and when they came near unto the altar they washed as the lord commanded moses and he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar and set up the hanging of the court gate so moses finished the work then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation and the glory of the lord filled the tabernacle and moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation because the cloud abode thereon and the glory of the lord filled the tabernacle and when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle the children of israel went onward in all their journeys but if the cloud were not taken up then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up for the cloud of the lord was upon the tabernacle by day and fire was on it by night in the sight of all the house of israel throughout all their journeys the third book of moses called leviticus and the lord called unto moses and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them if any man of you bring an offering unto the lord ye shall bring your offering of the cattle even of the herd and of the flock if his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd let him offer a male without blemish he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the lord and he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him and he shall kill the bullock before the lord and the priests aarons sons shall bring the blood and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and he shall flay the burnt offering and cut it into his pieces and the sons of aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar and lay the wood in order upon the fire and the priests aarons sons shall lay the parts the head and the fat in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar but his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water and the priest shall burn all on the altar to be a burnt sacrifice an offering made by fire of a sweet savour unto the lord and if his offering be of the flocks namely of the sheep or of the goats for a burnt sacrifice
