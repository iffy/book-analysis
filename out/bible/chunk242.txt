up a king over israel who shall cut off the house of jeroboam that day but what even now for the lord shall smite israel as a reed is shaken in the water and he shall root up israel out of this good land which he gave to their fathers and shall scatter them beyond the river because they have made their groves provoking the lord to anger and he shall give israel up because of the sins of jeroboam who did sin and who made israel to sin and jeroboams wife arose and departed and came to tirzah and when she came to the threshold of the door the child died and they buried him and all israel mourned for him according to the word of the lord which he spake by the hand of his servant ahijah the prophet and the rest of the acts of jeroboam how he warred and how he reigned behold they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel and the days which jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years and he slept with his fathers and nadab his son reigned in his stead and rehoboam the son of solomon reigned in judah rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign and he reigned seventeen years in jerusalem the city which the lord did choose out of all the tribes of israel to put his name there and his mothers name was naamah an ammonitess and judah did evil in the sight of the lord and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed above all that their fathers had done for they also built them high places and images and groves on every high hill and under every green tree and there were also sodomites in the land and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the lord cast out before the children of israel and it came to pass in the fifth year of king rehoboam that shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem and he took away the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the kings house he even took away all and he took away all the shields of gold which solomon had made and king rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard which kept the door of the kings house and it was so when the king went into the house of the lord that the guard bare them and brought them back into the guard chamber now the rest of the acts of rehoboam and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah and there was war between rehoboam and jeroboam all their days and rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david and his mothers name was naamah an ammonitess and abijam his son reigned in his stead now in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam the son of nebat reigned abijam over judah three years reigned he in jerusalem and his mothers name was maachah the daughter of abishalom and he walked in all the sins of his father which he had done before him and his heart was not perfect with the lord his god as the heart of david his father nevertheless for davids sake did the lord his god give him a lamp in jerusalem to set up his son after him and to establish jerusalem because david did that which was right in the eyes of the lord and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life save only in the matter of uriah the hittite and there was war between rehoboam and jeroboam all the days of his life now the rest of the acts of abijam and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah and there was war between abijam and jeroboam and abijam slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of david and asa his son reigned in his stead and in the twentieth year of jeroboam king of israel reigned asa over judah and forty and one years reigned he in jerusalem and his mothers name was maachah the daughter of abishalom and asa did that which was right in the eyes of the lord as did david his father and he took away the sodomites out of the land and removed all the idols that his fathers had made and also maachah his mother even her he removed from being queen because she had made an idol in a grove and asa destroyed her idol and burnt it by the brook kidron but the high places were not removed nevertheless asas heart was perfect with the lord all his days and he brought in the things which his father had dedicated and the things which himself had dedicated into the house of the lord silver and gold and vessels and there was war between asa and baasha king of israel all their days and baasha king of israel went up against judah and built ramah that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to asa king of judah then asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the kings house and delivered them into the hand of his servants and king asa sent them to benhadad the son of tabrimon the son of hezion king of syria that dwelt at damascus saying there is a league between me and thee and between my father and thy father behold i have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold come and break thy league with baasha king of israel that he may depart from me so benhadad hearkened unto king asa and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of israel and smote ijon and dan and abelbethmaachah and all cinneroth with all the land of naphtali and it came to pass when baasha heard thereof that he left off building
