his life abhorreth bread and his soul dainty meat his flesh is consumed away that it cannot be seen and his bones that were not seen stick out yea his soul draweth near unto the grave and his life to the destroyers if there be a messenger with him an interpreter one among a thousand to shew unto man his uprightness then he is gracious unto him and saith deliver him from going down to the pit i have found a ransom his flesh shall be fresher than a childs he shall return to the days of his youth he shall pray unto god and he will be favourable unto him and he shall see his face with joy for he will render unto man his righteousness he looketh upon men and if any say i have sinned and perverted that which was right and it profited me not he will deliver his soul from going into the pit and his life shall see the light lo all these things worketh god oftentimes with man to bring back his soul from the pit to be enlightened with the light of the living mark well o job hearken unto me hold thy peace and i will speak if thou hast anything to say answer me speak for i desire to justify thee if not hearken unto me hold thy peace and i shall teach thee wisdom furthermore elihu answered and said hear my words o ye wise men and give ear unto me ye that have knowledge for the ear trieth words as the mouth tasteth meat let us choose to us judgment let us know among ourselves what is good for job hath said i am righteous and god hath taken away my judgment should i lie against my right my wound is incurable without transgression what man is like job who drinketh up scorning like water which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity and walketh with wicked men for he hath said it profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with god therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding far be it from god that he should do wickedness and from the almighty that he should commit iniquity for the work of a man shall he render unto him and cause every man to find according to his ways yea surely god will not do wickedly neither will the almighty pervert judgment who hath given him a charge over the earth or who hath disposed the whole world if he set his heart upon man if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath all flesh shall perish together and man shall turn again unto dust if now thou hast understanding hear this hearken to the voice of my words shall even he that hateth right govern and wilt thou condemn him that is most just is it fit to say to a king thou art wicked and to princes ye are ungodly how much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes nor regardeth the rich more than the poor for they all are the work of his hands in a moment shall they die and the people shall be troubled at midnight and pass away and the mighty shall be taken away without hand for his eyes are upon the ways of man and he seeth all his goings there is no darkness nor shadow of death where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves for he will not lay upon man more than right that he should enter into judgment with god he shall break in pieces mighty men without number and set others in their stead therefore he knoweth their works and he overturneth them in the night so that they are destroyed he striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others because they turned back from him and would not consider any of his ways so that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him and he heareth the cry of the afflicted when he giveth quietness who then can make trouble and when he hideth his face who then can behold him whether it be done against a nation or against a man only that the hypocrite reign not lest the people be ensnared surely it is meet to be said unto god i have borne chastisement i will not offend any more that which i see not teach thou me if i have done iniquity i will do no more should it be according to thy mind he will recompense it whether thou refuse or whether thou choose and not i therefore speak what thou knowest let men of understanding tell me and let a wise man hearken unto me job hath spoken without knowledge and his words were without wisdom my desire is that job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men for he addeth rebellion unto his sin he clappeth his hands among us and multiplieth his words against god elihu spake moreover and said thinkest thou this to be right that thou saidst my righteousness is more than gods for thou saidst what advantage will it be unto thee and what profit shall i have if i be cleansed from my sin i will answer thee and thy companions with thee look unto the heavens and see and behold the clouds which are higher than thou if thou sinnest what doest thou against him or if thy transgressions be multiplied what doest thou unto him if thou be righteous what givest thou him or what receiveth he of thine hand thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art and thy righteousness may profit the son of man by reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty but none saith where is god my maker who giveth songs in the night who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven there they cry but none giveth answer because of the pride of evil men surely god will not hear vanity neither will the almighty regard it although thou sayest thou shalt not see him yet judgment is before him therefore trust thou
