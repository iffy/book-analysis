thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies that i might destroy them that hate me they cried but there was none to save them even unto the lord but he answered them not then did i beat them small as the dust before the wind i did cast them out as the dirt in the streets thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people and thou hast made me the head of the heathen a people whom i have not known shall serve me as soon as they hear of me they shall obey me the strangers shall submit themselves unto me the strangers shall fade away and be afraid out of their close places the lord liveth and blessed be my rock and let the god of my salvation be exalted it is god that avengeth me and subdueth the people under me he delivereth me from mine enemies yea thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me thou hast delivered me from the violent man therefore will i give thanks unto thee o lord among the heathen and sing praises unto thy name great deliverance giveth he to his king and sheweth mercy to his anointed to david and to his seed for evermore the heavens declare the glory of god and the firmament sheweth his handywork day unto day uttereth speech and night unto night sheweth knowledge there is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard their line is gone out through all the earth and their words to the end of the world in them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race his going forth is from the end of the heaven and his circuit unto the ends of it and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof the law of the lord is perfect converting the soul the testimony of the lord is sure making wise the simple the statutes of the lord are right rejoicing the heart the commandment of the lord is pure enlightening the eyes the fear of the lord is clean enduring for ever the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether more to be desired are they than gold yea than much fine gold sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb moreover by them is thy servant warned and in keeping of them there is great reward who can understand his errors cleanse thou me from secret faults keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins let them not have dominion over me then shall i be upright and i shall be innocent from the great transgression let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight o lord my strength and my redeemer the lord hear thee in the day of

right hand shall find out those that hate thee thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger the lord shall swallow them up in his wrath and the fire shall devour them their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth and their seed from among the children of men for they intended evil against thee they imagined a mischievous device which they are not able to perform therefore shalt thou make them turn their back when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them be thou exalted lord in thine own strength so will we sing and praise thy power

silent but thou art holy o thou that inhabitest the praises of israel our fathers trusted in thee they trusted and thou didst deliver them they cried unto thee and were delivered they trusted in thee and were not confounded but i am a worm and no man a reproach of men and despised of the people all they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip they shake the head saying he trusted on the lord that he would deliver him let him deliver him seeing he delighted in him but thou art he that took me out of the womb thou didst make me hope when i was upon my mothers breasts i was cast upon thee from the womb thou art my god from my mothers belly be not
