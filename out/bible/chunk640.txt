both seen him and it is he that talketh with thee and he said lord i believe and he worshipped him and jesus said for judgment i am come into this world that they which see not might see and that they which see might be made blind and some of the pharisees which were with him heard these words and said unto him are we blind also jesus said unto them if ye were blind ye should have no sin but now ye say we see therefore your sin remaineth verily verily i say unto you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same is a thief and a robber but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep to him the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out and when he putteth forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers this parable spake jesus unto them but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them then said jesus unto them again verily verily i say unto you i am the door of the sheep all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the sheep did not hear them i am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy i am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly i am the good shepherd the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep but he that is an hireling and not the shepherd whose own the sheep are not seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and fleeth and the wolf catcheth them and scattereth the sheep the hireling fleeth because he is an hireling and careth not for the sheep i am the good shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine as the father knoweth me even so know i the father and i lay down my life for the sheep and other sheep i have which are not of this fold them also i must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one shepherd therefore doth my father love me because i lay down my life that i might take it again no man taketh it from me but i lay it down of myself i have power to lay it down and i have power to take it again this commandment have i received of my father there was a division therefore again among the jews for these sayings and many of them said he hath a devil and is mad why hear ye him others said these are not the words of him that hath a devil can a devil open the eyes of the blind and it was at jerusalem the feast of the dedication and it was winter and jesus walked in the temple in solomons porch then came the jews round about him and said unto him how long dost thou make us to doubt if thou be the christ tell us plainly jesus answered them i told you and ye believed not the works that i do in my fathers name they bear witness of me but ye believe not because ye are not of my sheep as i said unto you my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my fathers hand i and my father are one then the jews took up stones again to stone him jesus answered them many good works have i shewed you from my father for which of those works do ye stone me the jews answered him saying for a good work we stone thee not but for blasphemy and because that thou being a man makest thyself god jesus answered them is it not written in your law i said ye are gods if he called them gods unto whom the word of god came and the scripture cannot be broken say ye of him whom the father hath sanctified and sent into the world thou blasphemest because i said i am the son of god if i do not the works of my father believe me not but if i do though ye believe not me believe the works that ye may know and believe that the father is in me and i in him therefore they sought again to take him but he escaped out of their hand and went away again beyond jordan into the place where john at first baptized and there he abode and many resorted unto him and said john did no miracle but all things that john spake of this man were true and many believed on him there now a certain man was sick named lazarus of bethany the town of mary and her sister martha it was that mary which anointed the lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother lazarus was sick therefore his sisters sent unto him saying lord behold he whom thou lovest is sick when jesus heard that he said this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of god that the son of god might be glorified thereby now jesus loved martha and her sister and lazarus when he had heard therefore that he was sick he abode two days still in the same place where he was then after that saith he to his disciples let us go into judaea again his disciples say unto him master the jews of late sought to stone thee and goest thou thither again jesus answered are there not twelve hours in the day if any
