vessels of the house of god and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of god and shut up the doors of the house of the lord and he made him altars in every corner of jerusalem and in every several city of judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods and provoked to anger the lord god of his fathers now the rest of his acts and of all his ways first and last behold they are written in the book of the kings of judah and israel and ahaz slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city even in jerusalem but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of israel and hezekiah his son reigned in his stead hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old and he reigned nine and twenty years in jerusalem and his mothers name was abijah the daughter of zechariah and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord according to all that david his father had done he in the first year of his reign in the first month opened the doors of the house of the lord and repaired them and he brought in the priests and the levites and gathered them together into the east street and said unto them hear me ye levites sanctify now yourselves and sanctify the house of the lord god of your fathers and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place for our fathers have trespassed and done that which was evil in the eyes of the lord our god and have forsaken him and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the lord and turned their backs also they have shut up the doors of the porch and put out the lamps and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the god of israel wherefore the wrath of the lord was upon judah and jerusalem and he hath delivered them to trouble to astonishment and to hissing as ye see with your eyes for lo our fathers have fallen by the sword and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the lord god of israel that his fierce wrath may turn away from us my sons be not now negligent for the lord hath chosen you to stand before him to serve him and that ye should minister unto him and burn incense then the levites arose mahath the son of amasai and joel the son of azariah of the sons of the kohathites and of the sons of merari kish the son of abdi and azariah the son of jehalelel and of the gershonites joah the son of zimmah and eden the son of joah and of the sons of elizaphan shimri and jeiel and of the sons of asaph zechariah and mattaniah and of the sons of heman jehiel and shimei and of the sons of jeduthun shemaiah and uzziel and they gathered their brethren and sanctified themselves and came according to the commandment of the king by the words of the lord to cleanse the house of the lord and the priests went into the inner part of the house of the lord to cleanse it and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the lord into the court of the house of the lord and the levites took it to carry it out abroad into the brook kidron now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the lord so they sanctified the house of the lord in eight days and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end then they went in to hezekiah the king and said we have
