i pray thee o lord my god be on me and on my fathers house but not on thy people that they should be plagued then the angel of the lord commanded gad to say to david that david should go up and set up an altar unto the lord in the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite and david went up at the saying of gad which he spake in the name of the lord and ornan turned back and saw the angel and his four sons with him hid themselves now ornan was threshing wheat and as david came to ornan ornan looked and saw david and went out of the threshingfloor and bowed himself to david with his face to the ground then david said to ornan grant me the place of this threshingfloor that i may build an altar therein unto the lord thou shalt grant it me for the full price that the plague may be stayed from the people and ornan said unto david take it to thee and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes lo i give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings and the threshing instruments for wood and the wheat for the meat offering i give it all and king david said to ornan nay but i will verily buy it for the full price for i will not take that which is thine for the lord nor offer burnt offerings without cost so david gave to ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight and david built there an altar unto the lord and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings and called upon the lord and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering and the lord commanded the angel and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof at that time when david saw that the lord had answered him in the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite then he sacrificed there for the tabernacle of the lord which moses made in the wilderness and the altar of the burnt offering were at that season in the high place at gibeon but david could not go before it to enquire of god for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the lord then david said this is the house of the lord god and this is the altar of the burnt offering for israel and david commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of israel and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of god and david prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates and for the joinings and brass in abundance without weight also cedar trees in abundance for the zidonians and they of tyre brought much cedar wood to david and david said solomon my son is young and tender and the house that is to be builded for the lord must be exceeding magnifical of fame and of glory throughout all countries i will therefore now make preparation for it so david prepared abundantly before his death then he called for solomon his son and charged him to build an house for the lord god of israel and david said to solomon my son as for me it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the lord my god but the word of the lord came to me saying thou hast shed blood abundantly and hast made great wars thou shalt not build an house unto my name because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight behold a son shall be born to thee who shall be a man of rest and i will give him rest from all his enemies round about for his name shall be solomon and i will give peace and quietness unto israel in his days he shall build an house for my name and he shall be my son and i will be his father and i will establish the throne of his kingdom over israel for ever now my son the lord be with thee and prosper thou and build the house of the lord thy god as he hath said of thee only the lord give thee wisdom and understanding and give thee charge concerning israel that thou mayest keep the law of the lord thy god then shalt thou prosper if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the lord charged moses with concerning israel be strong and of good courage dread not nor be dismayed now behold in my trouble i have prepared for the house of the lord an hundred thousand talents of gold and a thousand thousand talents of silver and of brass and iron without weight for it is in abundance timber also and stone have i prepared and thou mayest add thereto moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance hewers and workers of stone and timber and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work of the gold the silver and the brass and the iron there is no number arise therefore and be doing and the lord be with thee david also commanded all the princes of israel to help solomon his son saying is not the lord your god with you and hath he not given you rest on every side for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand and the land is subdued before the lord and before his people now set your heart and your soul to seek the lord your god arise therefore and build ye the sanctuary of the lord god to bring the ark of the covenant of the lord and the holy vessels of god into the house that is to be built to the name of the lord so when david was old and full of days he made solomon his son king over israel and he gathered together all the princes of israel with the priests and the levites now the levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward and their number by their polls man by man was thirty and eight thousand of which twenty and four thousand were to set
