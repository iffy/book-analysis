of his meat be left therefore shall no man look for his goods in the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits every hand of the wicked shall come upon him when he is about to fill his belly god shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him and shall rain it upon him while he is eating he shall flee from the iron weapon and the bow of steel shall strike him through it is drawn and cometh out of the body yea the glittering sword cometh out of his gall terrors are upon him all darkness shall be hid in his secret places a fire not blown shall consume him it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle the heaven shall reveal his iniquity and the earth shall rise up against him the increase of his house shall depart and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath this is the portion of a wicked man from god and the heritage appointed unto him by god but job answered and said hear diligently my speech and let this be your consolations suffer me that i may speak and after that i have spoken mock on as for me is my complaint to man and if it were so why should not my spirit be troubled mark me and be astonished and lay your hand upon your mouth even when i remember i am afraid and trembling taketh hold on my flesh wherefore do the wicked live become old yea are mighty in power their seed is established in their sight with them and their offspring before their eyes their houses are safe from fear neither is the rod of god upon them their bull gendereth and faileth not their cow calveth and casteth not her calf they send forth their little ones like a flock and their children dance they take the timbrel and harp and rejoice at the sound of the organ they spend their days in wealth and in a moment go down to the grave therefore they say unto god depart from us for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways what is the almighty that we should serve him and what profit should we have if we pray unto him lo their good is not in their hand the counsel of the wicked is far from me how oft is the candle of the wicked put out and how oft cometh their destruction upon them god distributeth sorrows in his anger they are as stubble before the wind and as chaff that the storm carrieth away god layeth up his iniquity for his children he rewardeth him and he shall know it his eyes shall see his destruction and he shall drink of the wrath of the almighty for what pleasure hath he in his house after him when the number of his months is cut off in the midst shall any teach god knowledge seeing he judgeth those that are high one dieth in his full strength being wholly at ease and quiet his breasts are full of milk and his bones are moistened with marrow and another dieth in the bitterness of his soul and never eateth with pleasure they shall lie down alike in the dust and the worms shall cover them behold i know your thoughts and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me for ye say where is the house of the prince and where are the dwelling places of the wicked have ye not asked them that go by the way and do ye not know their tokens that the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath who shall declare his way to his face and who shall repay him what he hath done yet shall he be brought to the grave and shall remain in the tomb the clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him and every man shall draw after him as there are innumerable before him how then comfort ye me in vain seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood then eliphaz the temanite answered and said can a man be profitable unto god as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself is it any pleasure to the almighty that thou art righteous or is it gain to him that thou makest thy ways perfect will he reprove thee for fear of thee will he enter with thee into judgment is not thy wickedness great and thine iniquities infinite for thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought and stripped the naked of their clothing thou hast not given water to the weary to drink and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry but as for the mighty man he had the earth and the honourable man dwelt in it thou hast sent widows away empty and the arms of the fatherless have been broken therefore snares are round about thee and sudden fear troubleth thee or darkness that thou canst not see and abundance of waters cover thee is not god in the height of heaven and behold the height of the stars how high they are and thou sayest how doth god know can he judge through the dark cloud thick clouds are a covering to him that he seeth not and he walketh in the circuit of heaven hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden which were cut down out of time whose foundation was overflown with a flood which said unto god depart from us and what can the almighty do for them yet he filled their houses with good things but the counsel of the wicked is far from me the righteous see it and are glad and the innocent laugh them to scorn whereas our substance is not cut down but the remnant of them the fire consumeth acquaint now thyself with him and be at peace thereby good shall come unto thee receive i pray thee the law from his mouth and lay up his words in thine heart if thou return to the almighty thou shalt be built up thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles then shalt thou lay up gold as dust and the gold of ophir as
