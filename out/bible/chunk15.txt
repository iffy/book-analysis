the daughter of bethuel nahors son whom milcah bare unto him and i put the earring upon her face and the bracelets upon her hands and i bowed down my head and worshipped the lord and blessed the lord god of my master abraham which had led me in the right way to take my masters brothers daughter unto his son and now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master tell me and if not tell me that i may turn to the right hand or to the left then laban and bethuel answered and said the thing proceedeth from the lord we cannot speak unto thee bad or good behold rebekah is before thee take her and go and let her be thy masters sons wife as the lord hath spoken and it came to pass that when abrahams servant heard their words he worshipped the lord bowing himself to the earth and the servant brought forth jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment and gave them to rebekah he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things and they did eat and drink he and the men that were with him and tarried all night and they rose up in the morning and he said send me away unto my master and her brother and her mother said let the damsel abide with us a few days at the least ten after that she shall go and he said unto them hinder me not seeing the lord hath prospered my way send me away that i may go to my master and they said we will call the damsel and enquire at her mouth and they called rebekah and said unto her wilt thou go with this man and she said i will go and they sent away rebekah their sister and her nurse and abrahams servant and his men and they blessed rebekah and said unto her thou art our sister be thou the mother of thousands of millions and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them and rebekah arose and her damsels and they rode upon the camels and followed the man and the servant took rebekah and went his way and isaac came from the way of the well lahairoi for he dwelt in the south country and isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide and he lifted up his eyes and saw and behold the camels were coming and rebekah lifted up her eyes and when she saw isaac she lighted off the camel for she had said unto the servant what man is this that walketh in the field to meet us and the servant had said it is my master therefore she took a vail and covered herself and the servant told isaac all things that he had done and isaac brought her into his mother sarahs tent and took rebekah and she became his wife and he loved her and isaac was comforted after his mothers death then again abraham took a wife and her name was keturah and she bare him zimran and jokshan and medan and midian and ishbak and shuah and jokshan begat sheba and dedan and the sons of dedan were asshurim and letushim and leummim and the sons of midian ephah and epher and hanoch and abidah and eldaah all these were the children of keturah and abraham gave all that he had unto isaac but unto the sons of the concubines which abraham had abraham gave gifts and sent them away from isaac his son while he yet lived eastward unto the east country and these are the days of the years of abrahams life which he lived an hundred threescore and fifteen years then abraham gave up the ghost and died in a good old age an old man and full of years and was gathered to his people and his sons isaac and ishmael buried him in the cave of machpelah in the field of ephron the son of zohar the hittite which is before mamre the field which abraham purchased of the sons of heth there was abraham buried and sarah his wife and it came to pass after the death of abraham that god blessed his son isaac and isaac dwelt by the well lahairoi now these are the generations of ishmael abrahams son whom hagar the egyptian sarahs handmaid bare unto abraham

of ishmael an hundred and thirty and seven years and he gave up the ghost and died and was gathered unto his people and they dwelt from havilah unto shur that is before egypt as thou goest toward assyria and he died in the presence of all his brethren and these are the generations of isaac abrahams son abraham begat isaac and isaac was forty years old when he took rebekah to wife the daughter of bethuel the syrian of padanaram the sister to laban the syrian and isaac intreated the lord for his wife because she was barren and the lord was intreated of him and rebekah his wife conceived and the children struggled together within her and she said if it be so why am i thus and she went to enquire of the lord and the lord said unto her two nations are in thy womb and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels and the one people shall be stronger than the other people and the elder shall serve the younger and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled behold there were twins in her womb and the first came out red all over like an hairy garment and they called his name esau and after that came his brother out and his hand took hold on esaus heel and his name was called jacob and isaac was threescore years old when she bare them and the boys grew and
