israel which dwelt in the cities of judah rehoboam reigned over them then king rehoboam sent adoram who was over the tribute and all israel stoned him with stones that he died therefore king rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot to flee to jerusalem so israel rebelled against the house of david unto this day and it came to pass when all israel heard that jeroboam was come again that they sent and called him unto the congregation and made him king over all israel there was none that followed the house of david but the tribe of judah only and when rehoboam was come to jerusalem he assembled all the house of judah with the tribe of benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men which were warriors to fight against the house of israel to bring the kingdom again to rehoboam the son of solomon but the word of god came unto shemaiah the man of god saying speak unto rehoboam the son of solomon king of judah and unto all the house of judah and benjamin and to the remnant of the people saying thus saith the lord ye shall not go up nor fight against your brethren the children of israel return every man to his house for this thing is from me they hearkened therefore to the word of the lord and returned to depart according to the word of the lord then jeroboam built shechem in mount ephraim and dwelt therein and went out from thence and built penuel and jeroboam said in his heart now shall the kingdom return to the house of david if this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the lord at jerusalem then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord even unto rehoboam king of judah and they shall kill me and go again to rehoboam king of judah whereupon the king took counsel and made two calves of gold and said unto them it is too much for you to go up to jerusalem behold thy gods o israel which brought thee up out of the land of egypt and he set the one in bethel and the other put he in dan and this thing became a sin for the people went to worship before the one even unto dan and he made an house of high places and made priests of the lowest of the people which were not of the sons of levi and jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month on the fifteenth day of the month like unto the feast that is in judah and he offered upon the altar so did he in bethel sacrificing unto the calves that he had made and he placed in bethel the priests of the high places which he had made so he offered upon the altar which he had made in bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month even in the month which he had devised of his own heart and ordained a feast unto the children of israel and he offered upon the altar and burnt incense and behold there came a man of god out of judah by the word of the lord unto bethel and jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense and he cried against the altar in the word of the lord and said o altar altar thus saith the lord behold a child shall be born unto the house of david josiah by name and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee and mens bones shall be burnt upon thee and he gave a sign the same day saying this is the sign which the lord hath spoken behold the altar shall be rent and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out and it came to pass when king jeroboam heard the saying of the man of god which had cried against the altar in bethel that he put forth his hand from the altar saying lay hold on him and his hand which he put forth against him dried up so that he could not pull it in again to him the altar also was rent and the ashes poured out from the altar according to the sign which the man of god had given by the word of the lord and the king answered and said unto the man of god intreat now the face of the lord thy god and pray for me that my hand may be restored me again and the man of god besought the lord and the kings hand was restored him again and became as it was before and the king said unto the man of god come home with me and refresh thyself and i will give thee a reward and the man of god said unto the king if thou wilt give me half thine house i will not go in with thee neither will i eat bread nor drink water in this place for so was it charged me by the word of the lord saying eat no bread nor drink water nor turn again by the same way that thou camest so he went another way and returned not by the way that he came to bethel now there dwelt an old prophet in bethel and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of god had done that day in bethel the words which he had spoken unto the king them they told also to their father and their father said unto them what way went he for his sons had seen what way the man of god went which came from judah and he said unto his sons saddle me the ass so they saddled him the ass and he rode thereon and went after the man of god and found him sitting under an oak and he said unto him art thou the man of god that camest from judah and he said i am then he said unto him come home with me and eat bread and he said i may not return with thee nor go in with thee neither will i eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place for it was said to me by
