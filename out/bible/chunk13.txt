ram caught in a thicket by his horns and abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son and abraham called the name of that place jehovahjireh as it is said to this day in the mount of the lord it shall be seen and the angel of the lord called unto abraham out of heaven the second time and said by myself have i sworn saith the lord for because thou hast done this thing and hast not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea shore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice so abraham returned unto his young men and they rose up and went together to beersheba and abraham dwelt at beersheba and it came to pass after these things that it was told abraham saying behold milcah she hath also born children unto thy brother nahor huz his firstborn and buz his brother and kemuel the father of aram and chesed and hazo and pildash and jidlaph and bethuel and bethuel begat rebekah these eight milcah did bear to

the sons of heth saying i am a stranger and a sojourner with you give me a possession of a buryingplace with you that i may bury my dead out of my sight and the children of heth answered abraham saying unto him hear us my lord thou art a mighty prince among us in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre but that thou mayest bury thy dead and abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land even to the children of heth and he communed with them saying if it be your mind that i should bury my dead out of my sight hear me and
