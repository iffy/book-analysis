circumcised let him not become uncircumcised is any called in uncircumcision let him not be circumcised circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing but the keeping of the commandments of god let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called art thou called being a servant care not for it but if thou mayest be made free use it rather for he that is called in the lord being a servant is the lords freeman likewise also he that is called being free is christs servant ye are bought with a price be not ye the servants of men brethren let every man wherein he is called therein abide with god now concerning virgins i have no commandment of the lord yet i give my judgment as one that hath obtained mercy of the lord to be faithful i suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress i say that it is good for a man so to be art thou bound unto a wife seek not to be loosed art thou loosed from a wife seek not a wife but and if thou marry thou hast not sinned and if a virgin marry she hath not sinned nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh but i spare you but this i say brethren the time is short it remaineth that both they that have wives be as though they had none and they that weep as though they wept not and they that rejoice as though they rejoiced not and they that buy as though they possessed not and they that use this world as not abusing it for the fashion of this world passeth away but i would have you without carefulness he that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the lord how he may please the lord but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world how he may please his wife there is difference also between a wife and a virgin the unmarried woman careth for the things of the lord that she may be holy both in body and in spirit but she that is married careth for the things of the world how she may please her husband and this i speak for your own profit not that i may cast a snare upon you but for that which is comely and that ye may attend upon the lord without distraction but if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin if she pass the flower of her age and need so require let him do what he will he sinneth not let them marry nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart having no necessity but hath power over his own will and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin doeth well so then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth but if her husband be dead she is at liberty to be married to whom she will only in the lord but she is happier if she so abide after my judgment and i think also that i have the spirit of god now as touching things offered unto idols we know that we all have knowledge knowledge puffeth up but charity edifieth and if any man think that he knoweth any thing he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know but if any man love god the same is known of him as concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is none other god but one for though there be that are called gods whether in heaven or in earth as there be gods many and lords many but to us there is but one god the father of whom are all things and we in him and one lord jesus christ by whom are all things and we by him howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol and their conscience being weak is defiled but meat commendeth us not to god for neither if we eat are we the better neither if we eat not are we the worse but take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak for if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idols temple shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols and through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish for whom christ died but when ye sin so against the brethren and wound their weak conscience ye sin against christ wherefore if meat make my brother to offend i will eat no flesh while the world standeth lest i make my brother to offend am i not an apostle am i not free have i not seen jesus christ our lord are not ye my work in the lord if i be not an apostle unto others yet doubtless i am to you for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the lord mine answer to them that do examine me is this have we not power to eat and to drink have we not power to lead about a sister a wife as well as other apostles and as the brethren of the lord and cephas or i only and barnabas have not we power to forbear working who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges who planteth a vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof or who feedeth a flock and eateth not of the milk of the flock say i these things as a man or saith not the law the same also for it is written in the law of moses thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn doth god take care for oxen or saith he it altogether for our sakes for our sakes no doubt this is written that
