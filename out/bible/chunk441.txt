be thine they shall come after thee in chains they shall come over and they shall fall down unto thee they shall make supplication unto thee saying surely god is in thee and there is none else there is no god verily thou art a god that hidest thyself o god of israel the saviour they shall be ashamed and also confounded all of them they shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols but israel shall be saved in the lord with an everlasting salvation ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end for thus saith the lord that created the heavens god himself that formed the earth and made it he hath established it he created it not in vain he formed it to be inhabited i am the lord and there is none else i have not spoken in secret in a dark place of the earth i said not unto the seed of jacob seek ye me in vain i the lord speak righteousness i declare things that are right assemble yourselves and come draw near together ye that are escaped of the nations they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image and pray unto a god that cannot save tell ye and bring them near yea let them take counsel together who hath declared this from ancient time who hath told it from that time have not i the lord and there is no god else beside me a just god and a saviour there is none beside me look unto me and be ye saved all the ends of the earth for i am god and there is none else i have sworn by myself the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness and shall not return that unto me every knee shall bow every tongue shall swear surely shall one say in the lord have i righteousness and strength even to him shall men come and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed in the lord shall all the seed of israel be justified and shall glory bel boweth down nebo stoopeth their idols were upon the beasts and upon the cattle your carriages were heavy loaden they are a burden to the weary beast they stoop they bow down together they could not deliver the burden but themselves are gone into captivity hearken unto me o house of jacob and all the remnant of the house of israel which are borne by me from the belly which are carried from the womb and even to your old age i am he and even to hoar hairs will i carry you i have made and i will bear even i will carry and will deliver you to whom will ye liken me and make me equal and compare me that we may be like they lavish gold out of the bag and weigh silver in the balance and hire a goldsmith and he maketh it a god they fall down yea they worship they bear him upon the shoulder they carry him and set him in his place and he standeth from his place shall he not remove yea one shall cry unto him yet can he not answer nor save him out of his trouble remember this and shew yourselves men bring it again to mind o ye transgressors remember the former things of old for i am god and there is none else i am god and there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and i will do all my pleasure calling a ravenous bird from the east the man that executeth my counsel from a far country yea i have spoken it i will also bring it to pass i have purposed it i will also do it hearken unto me ye stouthearted that are far from righteousness i bring near my righteousness it shall not be far off and my salvation shall not tarry and i will place salvation in zion for israel my glory come down and sit in the dust o virgin daughter of babylon sit on the ground there is no throne o daughter

be uncovered yea thy shame shall be seen i will take vengeance and i will not meet thee as a man as for our redeemer the lord of hosts is his name the holy one of israel sit thou silent and get thee
