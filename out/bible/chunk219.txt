sword and the kings servants said unto the king behold thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint and the king went forth and all his household after him and the king left ten women which were concubines to keep the house and the king went forth and all the people after him and tarried in a place that was far off and all his servants passed on beside him and all the cherethites and all the pelethites and all the gittites six hundred men which came after him from gath passed on before the king then said the king to ittai the gittite wherefore goest thou also with us return to thy place and abide with the king for thou art a stranger and also an exile whereas thou camest but yesterday should i this day make thee go up and down with us seeing i go whither i may return thou and take back thy brethren mercy and truth be with thee and ittai answered the king and said as the lord liveth and as my lord the king liveth surely in what place my lord the king shall be whether in death or life even there also will thy servant be and david said to ittai go and pass over and ittai the gittite passed over and all his men and all the little ones that were with him and all the country wept with a loud voice and all the people passed over the king also himself passed over the brook kidron and all the people passed over toward the way of the wilderness and lo zadok also and all the levites were with him bearing the ark of the covenant of god and they set down the ark of god and abiathar went up until all the people had done passing out of the city and the king said unto zadok carry back the ark of god into the city if i shall find favour in the eyes of the lord he will bring me again and shew me both it and his habitation but if he thus say i have no delight in thee behold here am i let him do to me as seemeth good unto him the king said also unto zadok the priest art not thou a seer return into the city in peace and your two sons with you ahimaaz thy son and jonathan the son of abiathar see i will tarry in the plain of the wilderness until there come word from you to certify me zadok therefore and abiathar carried the ark of god again to jerusalem and they tarried there and david went up by the ascent of mount olivet and wept as he went up and had his head covered and he went barefoot and all the people that was with him covered every man his head and they went up weeping as they went up and one told david saying ahithophel is among the conspirators with absalom and david said o lord i pray thee turn the counsel of ahithophel into foolishness and it came to pass that when david was come to the top of the mount where he worshipped god behold hushai the archite came to meet him with his coat rent and earth upon his head unto whom david said if thou passest on with me then thou shalt be a burden unto me but if thou return to the city and say unto absalom i will be thy servant o king as i have been thy fathers servant hitherto so will i now also be thy servant then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of ahithophel and hast thou not there with thee zadok and abiathar the priests therefore it shall be that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the kings house thou shalt tell it to zadok and abiathar the priests behold they have there with them their two sons ahimaaz zadoks son and jonathan abiathars son and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear so hushai davids friend came into the city and absalom came into jerusalem and when david was a little past the top of the hill behold ziba the servant of mephibosheth met him with a couple of asses saddled and upon them two hundred loaves of bread and an hundred bunches of raisins and an hundred of summer fruits and a bottle of wine and the king said unto ziba what meanest thou by these and ziba said the asses be for the kings household to ride on and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat and the wine that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink and the king said and where is thy masters son and ziba said unto the king behold he abideth at jerusalem for he said to day shall the house of israel restore me the kingdom of my father then said the king to ziba behold thine are all that pertained unto mephibosheth and ziba said i humbly beseech thee that i may find grace in thy sight my lord o king and when king david came to bahurim behold thence came out a man of the family of the house of saul whose name was shimei the son of gera he came forth and cursed still as he came and he cast stones at david and at all the servants of king david and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left and thus said shimei when he cursed come out come out thou bloody man and thou man of belial the lord hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of saul in whose stead thou hast reigned and the lord hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of absalom thy son and behold thou art taken in thy mischief because thou art a bloody man then said abishai the son of zeruiah unto the king why should this dead dog curse my lord the king let me go over i pray thee and take off his head and the king said what have i to do with you ye sons of zeruiah so let him curse because the lord hath said unto him
