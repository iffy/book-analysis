doth our law judge any man before it hear him and know what he doeth they answered and said unto him art thou also of galilee search and look for out of galilee ariseth no prophet and every man went unto his own house jesus went unto the mount of olives and early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them and the scribes and pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery and when they had set her in the midst they say unto him master this woman was taken in adultery in the very act now moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned but what sayest thou this they said tempting him that they might have to accuse him but jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her and again he stooped down and wrote on the ground and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the eldest even unto the last and jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst when jesus had lifted up himself and saw none but the woman he said unto her woman where are those thine accusers hath no man condemned thee she said no man lord and jesus said unto her neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more then spake jesus again unto them saying i am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life the pharisees therefore said unto him thou bearest record of thyself thy record is not true jesus answered and said unto them though i bear record of myself yet my record is true for i know whence i came and whither i go but ye cannot tell whence i come and whither i go ye judge after the flesh i judge no man and yet if i judge my judgment is true for i am not alone but i and the father that sent me it is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is true i am one that bear witness of myself and the father that sent me beareth witness of me then said they unto him where is thy father jesus answered ye neither know me nor my father if ye had known me ye should have known my father also these words spake jesus in the treasury as he taught in the temple and no man laid hands on him for his hour was not yet come then said jesus again unto them i go my way and ye shall seek me and shall die in your sins whither i go ye cannot come then said the jews will he kill himself because he saith whither i go ye cannot come and he said unto them ye are from beneath i am from above ye are of this world i am not of this world i said therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins for if ye believe not that i am he ye shall die in your sins then said they unto him who art thou and jesus saith unto them even the same that i said unto you from the beginning i have many things to say and to judge of you but he that sent me is true and i speak to the world those things which i have heard of him they understood not that he spake to them of the father then said jesus unto them when ye have lifted up the son of man then shall ye know that i am he and that i do nothing of myself but as my father hath taught me i speak these things and he that sent me is with me the father hath not left me alone for i do always those things that please him as he spake these words many believed on him then said jesus to those jews which believed on him if ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free they answered him we be abrahams seed and were never in bondage to any man how sayest thou ye shall be made free jesus answered them verily verily i say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin and the servant abideth not in the house for ever but the son abideth ever if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed i know that ye are abrahams seed but ye seek to kill me because my word hath no place in you i speak that which i have seen with my father and ye do that which ye have seen with your father they answered and said unto him abraham is our father jesus saith unto them if ye were abrahams children ye would do the works of abraham but now ye seek to kill me a man that hath told you the truth which i have heard of god this did not abraham ye do the deeds of your father then said they to him we be not born of fornication we have one father even god jesus said unto them if god were your father ye would love me for i proceeded forth and came from god neither came i of myself but he sent me why do ye not understand my speech even because ye cannot hear my word ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it and because i tell you the truth ye believe me not which of you convinceth me of sin and if i say the truth why do ye
