they watched him and sent forth spies which should feign themselves just men that they might take hold of his words that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor and they asked him saying master we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly neither acceptest thou the person of any but teachest the way of god truly is it lawful for us to give tribute unto caesar or no but he perceived their craftiness and said unto them why tempt ye me shew me a penny whose image and superscription hath it they answered and said caesars and he said unto them render therefore unto caesar the things which be caesars and unto god the things which be gods and they could not take hold of his words before the people and they marvelled at his answer and held their peace then came to him certain of the sadducees which deny that there is any resurrection and they asked him saying master moses wrote unto us if any mans brother die having a wife and he die without children that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother there were therefore seven brethren and the first took a wife and died without children and the second took her to wife and he died childless and the third took her and in like manner the seven also and they left no children and died last of all the woman died also therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she for seven had her to wife and jesus answering said unto them the children of this world marry and are given in marriage but they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage neither can they die any more for they are equal unto the angels and are the children of god being the children of the resurrection now that the dead are raised even moses shewed at the bush when he calleth the lord the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob for he is not a god of the dead but of the living for all live unto him then certain of the scribes answering said master thou hast well said and after that they durst not ask him any question at all and he said unto them how say they that christ is davids son and david himself saith in the book of psalms the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand till i make thine enemies thy footstool david therefore calleth him lord how is he then his son then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples beware of the scribes which desire to walk in long robes and love greetings in the markets and the highest seats in the synagogues and the chief rooms at feasts which devour widows houses and for a shew make long prayers the same shall receive greater damnation and he looked up and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury and he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites and he said of a truth i say unto you that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all for all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of god but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had and as some spake of the temple how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts he said as for these things which ye behold the days will come in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and they asked him saying master but when shall these things be and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass and he said take heed that ye be not deceived for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and the time draweth near go ye not therefore after them but when ye shall hear of wars and commotions be not terrified for these things must first come to pass but the end is not by and by then said he unto them nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and great earthquakes shall be in divers places and famines and pestilences and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven but before all these they shall lay their hands on you and persecute you delivering you up to the synagogues and into prisons being brought before kings and rulers for my names sake and it shall turn to you for a testimony settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate before what ye shall answer for i will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist and ye shall be betrayed both by parents and brethren and kinsfolks and friends and some of you shall they cause to be put to death and ye shall be hated of all men for my names sake but there shall not an hair of your head perish in your patience possess ye your souls and when ye shall see jerusalem compassed with armies then know that the desolation thereof is nigh then let them which are in judaea flee to the mountains and let them which are in the midst of it depart out and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto for these be the days of vengeance that all things which are written may be fulfilled but woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days for there shall be great distress in the land and wrath upon this people and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive into all nations and jerusalem shall be trodden down of the gentiles until the times of the gentiles be fulfilled and there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity the sea and the waves roaring mens hearts failing them for fear and
