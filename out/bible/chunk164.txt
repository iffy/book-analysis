them from before you then balak the son of zippor king of moab arose and warred against israel and sent and called balaam the son of beor to curse you but i would not hearken unto balaam therefore he blessed you still so i delivered you out of his hand and you went over jordan and came unto jericho and the men of jericho fought against you the amorites and the perizzites and the canaanites and the hittites and the girgashites the hivites and the jebusites and i delivered them into your hand and i sent the hornet before you which drave them out from before you even the two kings of the amorites but not with thy sword nor with thy bow and i have given you a land for which ye did not labour and cities which ye built not and ye dwell in them of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood and in egypt and serve ye the lord and if it seem evil unto you to serve the lord choose you this day whom ye will serve whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land ye dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the lord and the people answered and said god forbid that we should forsake the lord to serve other gods for the lord our god he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage and which did those great signs in our sight and preserved us in all the way wherein we went and among all the people through whom we passed and the lord drave out from before us all the people even the amorites which dwelt in the land therefore will we also serve the lord for he is our god and joshua said unto the people ye cannot serve the lord for he is an holy god he is a jealous god he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins if ye forsake the lord and serve strange gods then he will turn and do you hurt and consume you after that he hath done you good and the people said unto joshua nay but we will serve the lord and joshua said unto the people ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the lord to serve him and they said we are witnesses now therefore put away said he the strange gods which are among you and incline your heart unto the lord god of israel and the people said unto joshua the lord our god will we serve and his voice will we obey so joshua made a covenant with the people that day and set them a statute and an ordinance in shechem and joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of god and took a great stone and set it up there under an oak that was by the sanctuary of the lord and joshua said unto all the people behold this stone shall be a witness unto us for it hath heard all the words of the lord which he spake unto us it shall be therefore a witness unto you lest ye deny your god so joshua let the people depart every man unto his inheritance and it came to pass after these things that joshua the son of nun the servant of the lord died being an hundred and ten years old and they buried him in the border of his inheritance in timnathserah which is in mount ephraim on the north side of the hill of gaash and israel served the lord all the days of joshua and all the days of the elders that overlived joshua and which had known all the works of the lord that he had done for israel and the bones of joseph which the children of israel brought up out of egypt buried they in shechem in a parcel of ground which jacob bought of the sons of hamor the father of shechem for an hundred pieces of silver and it became the inheritance of the children of joseph and eleazar the son of aaron died and they buried him in a hill that pertained to phinehas his son which was given him in mount ephraim the book of judges now after the death of joshua it came to pass that the children of israel asked the lord saying who shall go up for us against the canaanites first to fight against them and the lord said judah shall go up behold i have delivered the land into his hand and judah said unto simeon his brother come up with me into my lot that we may fight against the canaanites and i likewise will go with thee into thy lot so simeon went with him and judah went up and the lord delivered the canaanites and the perizzites into their hand and they slew of them in bezek ten thousand men and they found adonibezek in bezek and they fought against him and they slew the canaanites and the perizzites but adonibezek fled and they pursued after him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and his great toes and adonibezek said threescore and ten kings having their thumbs and their great toes cut off gathered their meat under my table as i have done so god hath requited me and they brought him to jerusalem and there he died now the children of judah had fought against jerusalem and had taken it and smitten it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire and afterward the children of judah went down to fight against the canaanites that dwelt in the mountain and in the south and in the valley and judah went against the canaanites that dwelt in hebron now the name of hebron before was kirjatharba and they slew sheshai and ahiman and talmai and from thence he went against the inhabitants of debir and the name of debir before was kirjathsepher
