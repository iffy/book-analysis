lord commanded moses and there arose not a prophet since in israel like unto moses whom the lord knew face to face in all the signs and the wonders which the lord sent him to do in the land of egypt to pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land and in all that mighty hand and in all the great terror which moses shewed in the sight of all israel the book of joshua now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord spake unto joshua the son of nun moses minister saying moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this jordan thou and all this people unto the land which i do give to them even to the children of israel every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon that have i given unto you as i said unto moses from the wilderness and this lebanon even unto the great river the river euphrates all the land of the hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so i will be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of a good courage for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which i sware unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper withersoever thou goest this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success have not i commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee whithersoever thou goest then joshua commanded the officers of the people saying pass through the host and command the people saying prepare you victuals for within three days ye shall pass over this jordan to go in to possess the land which the lord your god giveth you to possess it and to the reubenites and to the gadites and to half the tribe of manasseh spake joshua saying remember the word which moses the servant of the lord commanded you saying the lord your god hath given you rest and hath given you this land your wives your little ones and your cattle shall remain in the land which moses gave you on this side jordan but ye shall pass before your brethren armed all the mighty men of valour and help them until the lord have given your brethren rest as he hath given you and they also have possessed the land which the lord your god giveth them then ye shall return unto the land of your possession and enjoy it which moses the lords servant gave you on this side jordan toward the sunrising and they answered joshua saying all that thou commandest us we will do and whithersoever thou sendest us we will go according as we hearkened unto moses in all things so will we hearken unto thee only the lord thy god be with thee as he was with moses whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him he shall be put to death only be strong and of a good courage and joshua the son of nun sent out of shittim two men to spy secretly saying go view the land even jericho and they went and came into an harlots house named rahab and lodged there and it was told the king of jericho saying behold there came men in hither to night of the children of israel to search out the country and the king of jericho sent unto rahab saying bring forth the men that are come to thee which are entered into thine house for they be come to search out all the country and the woman took the two men and hid them and said thus there came men unto me but i wist not whence they were and it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate when it was dark that the men went out whither the men went i wot not pursue after them quickly for ye shall overtake them but she had brought them up to the roof of the house and hid them with the stalks of flax which she had laid in order upon the roof and the men pursued after them the way to jordan unto the fords and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out they shut the gate and before they were laid down she came up unto them upon the roof and she said unto the men i know that the lord hath given you the land and that your terror is fallen upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you for we have heard how the lord dried up the water of the red sea for you when ye came out of egypt and what ye did unto the two kings of the amorites that were on the other side jordan sihon and og whom ye utterly destroyed and as soon as we had heard these things our hearts did melt neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you for the lord your god he is god in heaven above and in earth beneath now therefore i pray you swear unto me by the lord since i have shewed you kindness that ye will also shew kindness unto my fathers house and give me a true token and that ye will save alive my father and my mother and my brethren and my sisters and all that they have and deliver our lives from
