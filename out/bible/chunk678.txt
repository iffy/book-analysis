by grace then is it no more of works otherwise grace is no more grace but if it be of works then it is no more grace otherwise work is no more work what then israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for but the election hath obtained it and the rest were blinded according as it is written god hath given them the spirit of slumber eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not hear unto this day and david saith let their table be made a snare and a trap and a stumblingblock and a recompence unto them let their eyes be darkened that they may not see and bow down their back alway i say then have they stumbled that they should fall god forbid but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the gentiles for to provoke them to jealousy now if the fall of them be the riches of the world and the diminishing of them the riches of the gentiles how much more their fulness for i speak to you gentiles inasmuch as i am the apostle of the gentiles i magnify mine office if by any means i may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh and might save some of them for if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead for if the firstfruit be holy the lump is also holy and if the root be holy so are the branches and if some of the branches be broken off and thou being a wild olive tree wert graffed in among them and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree boast not against the branches but if thou boast thou bearest not the root but the root thee thou wilt say then the branches were broken off that i might be graffed in well because of unbelief they were broken off and thou standest by faith be not highminded but fear for if god spared not the natural branches take heed lest he also spare not thee behold therefore the goodness and severity of god on them which fell severity but toward thee goodness if thou continue in his goodness otherwise thou also shalt be cut off and they also if they abide not still in unbelief shall be graffed in for god is able to graff them in again for if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree how much more shall these which be the natural branches be graffed into their own olive tree for i would not brethren that ye should be ignorant of this mystery lest ye should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part is happened to israel until the fulness of the gentiles be come in and so all israel shall be saved as it is written there shall come out of sion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from jacob for this is my covenant unto them when i shall take away their sins as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sakes but as touching the election they are beloved for the fathers sakes for the gifts and calling of god are without repentance for as ye in times past have not believed god yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief even so have these also now not believed that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy for god hath concluded them all in unbelief that he might have mercy upon all o the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out for who hath known the mind of the lord or who hath been his counsellor or who hath first given to him and it shall be recompensed unto him again for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory for ever amen i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as god hath dealt to every man the measure of faith for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in christ and every one members one of another having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith or ministry let us wait on our ministering or he that teacheth on teaching or he that exhorteth on exhortation he that giveth let him do it with simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that sheweth mercy with cheerfulness let love be without dissimulation abhor that which is evil cleave to that which is good be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love in honour preferring one another not slothful in business fervent in spirit serving the lord rejoicing in hope patient in tribulation continuing instant in prayer distributing to the necessity of saints given to hospitality bless them which persecute you bless and curse not rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep be of the same mind one toward another mind not high things but condescend to men of low estate be not wise in your own conceits recompense to no man evil for evil provide things honest in the sight of all men if it be possible as much as lieth in you live peaceably with all men dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give place unto wrath for it is written vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give him drink
