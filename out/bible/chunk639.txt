not believe me he that is of god heareth gods words ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of god then answered the jews and said unto him say we not well that thou art a samaritan and hast a devil jesus answered i have not a devil but i honour my father and ye do dishonour me and i seek not mine own glory there is one that seeketh and judgeth verily verily i say unto you if a man keep my saying he shall never see death then said the jews unto him now we know that thou hast a devil abraham is dead and the prophets and thou sayest if a man keep my saying he shall never taste of death art thou greater than our father abraham which is dead and the prophets are dead whom makest thou thyself jesus answered if i honour myself my honour is nothing it is my father that honoureth me of whom ye say that he is your god yet ye have not known him but i know him and if i should say i know him not i shall be a liar like unto you but i know him and keep his saying your father abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and was glad then said the jews unto him thou art not yet fifty years old and hast thou seen abraham jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you before abraham was i am then took they up stones to cast at him but jesus hid himself and went out of the temple going through the midst of them and so passed by and as jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from his birth and his disciples asked him saying master who did sin this man or his parents that he was born blind jesus answered neither hath this man sinned nor his parents but that the works of god should be made manifest in him i must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world when he had thus spoken he spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay and said unto him go wash in the pool of siloam which is by interpretation sent he went his way therefore and washed and came seeing the neighbours therefore and they which before had seen him that he was blind said is not this he that sat and begged some said this is he others said he is like him but he said i am he therefore said they unto him how were thine eyes opened he answered and said a man that is called jesus made clay and anointed mine eyes and said unto me go to the pool of siloam and wash and i went and washed and i received sight then said they unto him where is he he said i know not they brought to the pharisees him that aforetime was blind and it was the sabbath day when jesus made the clay and opened his eyes then again the pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight he said unto them he put clay upon mine eyes and i washed and do see therefore said some of the pharisees this man is not of god because he keepeth not the sabbath day others said how can a man that is a sinner do such miracles and there was a division among them they say unto the blind man again what sayest thou of him that he hath opened thine eyes he said he is a prophet but the jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and received his sight until they called the parents of him that had received his sight and they asked them saying is this your son who ye say was born blind how then doth he now see his parents answered them and said we know that this is our son and that he was born blind but by what means he now seeth we know not or who hath opened his eyes we know not he is of age ask him he shall speak for himself these words spake his parents because they feared the jews for the jews had agreed already that if any man did confess that he was christ he should be put out of the synagogue therefore said his parents he is of age ask him then again called they the man that was blind and said unto him give god the praise we know that this man is a sinner he answered and said whether he be a sinner or no i know not one thing i know that whereas i was blind now i see then said they to him again what did he to thee how opened he thine eyes he answered them i have told you already and ye did not hear wherefore would ye hear it again will ye also be his disciples then they reviled him and said thou art his disciple but we are moses disciples we know that god spake unto moses as for this fellow we know not from whence he is the man answered and said unto them why herein is a marvellous thing that ye know not from whence he is and yet he hath opened mine eyes now we know that god heareth not sinners but if any man be a
