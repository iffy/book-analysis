about a stones cast and kneeled down and prayed saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done and there appeared an angel unto him from heaven strengthening him and being in an agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground and when he rose up from prayer and was come to his disciples he found them sleeping for sorrow and said unto them why sleep ye rise and pray lest ye enter into temptation and while he yet spake behold a multitude and he that was called judas one of the twelve went before them and drew near unto jesus to kiss him but jesus said unto him judas betrayest thou the son of man with a kiss when they which were about him saw what would follow they said unto him lord shall we smite with the sword and one of them smote the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear and jesus answered and said suffer ye thus far and he touched his ear and healed him then jesus said unto the chief priests and captains of the temple and the elders which were come to him be ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves when i was daily with you in the temple ye stretched forth no hands against me but this is your hour and the power of darkness then took they him and led him and brought him into the high priests house and peter followed afar off and when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall and were set down together peter sat down among them but a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire and earnestly looked upon him and said this man was also with him and he denied him saying woman i know him not and after a little while another saw him and said thou art also of them and peter said man i am not and about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed saying of a truth this fellow also was with him for he is a galilaean and peter said man i know not what thou sayest and immediately while he yet spake the cock crew and the lord turned and looked upon peter and peter remembered the word of the lord how he had said unto him before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice and peter went out and wept bitterly and the men that held jesus mocked him and smote him and when they had blindfolded him they struck him on the face and asked him saying prophesy who is it that smote thee and many other things blasphemously spake they against him and as soon as it was day the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together and led him into their council saying art thou the christ tell us and he said unto them if i tell you ye will not believe and if i also ask you ye will not answer me nor let me go hereafter shall the son of man sit on the right hand of the power of god then said they all art thou then the son of god and he said unto them ye say that i am and they said what need we any further witness for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth and the whole multitude of them arose and led him unto pilate and they began to accuse him saying we found this fellow perverting the nation and forbidding to give tribute to caesar saying that he himself is christ a king and pilate asked him saying art thou the king of the jews and he answered him and said thou sayest it then said pilate to the chief priests and to the people i find no fault in this man and they were the more fierce saying he stirreth up the people teaching throughout all jewry beginning from galilee to this place when pilate heard of galilee he asked whether the man were a galilaean and as soon as he knew that he belonged unto herods jurisdiction he sent him to herod who himself also was at jerusalem at that time and when herod saw jesus he was exceeding glad for he was desirous to see him of a long season because he had heard many things of him and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him then he questioned with him in many words but he answered him nothing and the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him and herod with his men of war set him at nought and mocked him and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe and sent him again to pilate and the same day pilate and herod were made friends together for before they were at enmity between themselves and pilate when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people said unto them ye have brought this man unto me as one that perverteth the people and behold i having examined him before you have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him no nor yet herod for i sent you to him and lo nothing worthy of death is done unto him i will therefore chastise him and release him for of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast and they cried out all at once saying away with this man and release unto us barabbas who for a certain sedition made in the city and for murder was cast into prison pilate therefore willing to release jesus spake again to them but they cried saying crucify him crucify him and he said unto them the third time why what evil hath he done i have found no cause of death in him i will therefore chastise him and let him go and they were instant with loud voices requiring that he might be crucified and the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed and pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required and he released unto them him that for
