and they that strive with thee shall perish thou shalt seek them and shalt not find them even them that contended with thee they that war against thee shall be as nothing and as a thing of nought for i the lord thy god will hold thy right hand saying unto thee fear not i will help thee fear not thou worm jacob and ye men of israel i will help thee saith the lord and thy redeemer the holy one of israel behold i will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth thou shalt thresh the mountains and beat them small and shalt make the hills as chaff thou shalt fan them and the wind shall carry them away and the whirlwind shall scatter them and thou shalt rejoice in the lord and shalt glory in the holy one of israel when the poor and needy seek water and there is none and their tongue faileth for thirst i the lord will hear them i the god of israel will not forsake them i will open rivers in high places and fountains in the midst of the valleys i will make the wilderness a pool of water and the dry land springs of water i will plant in the wilderness the cedar the shittah tree and the myrtle and the oil tree i will set in the desert the fir tree and the pine and the box tree together that they may see and know and consider and understand together that the hand of the lord hath done this and the holy one of israel hath created it produce your cause saith the lord bring forth your strong reasons saith the king of jacob let them bring them forth and shew us what shall happen let them shew the former things what they be that we may consider them and know the latter end of them or declare us things for to come shew the things that are to come hereafter that we may know that ye are gods yea do good or do evil that we may be dismayed and behold it together behold ye are of nothing and your work of nought an abomination is he that chooseth you i have raised up one from the north and he shall come from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name and he shall come upon princes as upon morter and as the potter treadeth clay who hath declared from the beginning that we may know and beforetime that we may say he is righteous yea there is none that sheweth yea there is none that declareth yea there is none that heareth your words the first shall say to zion behold behold them and i will give to jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings for i beheld and there was no man even among them and there was no counsellor that when i asked of them could answer a word behold they are all vanity their works are nothing their molten images are wind and confusion behold my servant whom i uphold mine elect in whom my soul delighteth i have put my spirit upon him he shall bring forth judgment to the gentiles he shall not cry nor lift up nor cause his voice to be heard in the street a bruised reed shall he not break and the smoking flax shall he not quench he shall bring forth judgment unto truth he shall not fail nor be discouraged till he have set judgment in the earth and the isles shall wait for his law thus saith god the lord he that created the heavens and stretched them out he that spread forth the earth and that which cometh out of it he that giveth breath unto the people upon it and spirit to them that walk therein i the lord have called thee in righteousness and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the gentiles to open the blind eyes to bring out the prisoners from the prison and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house i am the lord that is my name and my glory will i not give to another neither my praise to graven images behold the former things are come to pass and new things do i declare before they spring forth i tell you of them sing unto the lord a new song and his praise from the end of the earth ye that go down to the sea and all that is therein the isles and the inhabitants thereof let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice the villages that kedar doth inhabit let the inhabitants of the rock sing let them shout from the top of the mountains let them give glory unto the lord and declare his praise in the islands the lord shall go forth as a mighty man he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war he shall cry yea roar he shall prevail against his enemies i have long time holden my peace i have been still and refrained myself now will i cry like a travailing woman i will destroy and devour at once i will make waste mountains and hills and dry up all their herbs and i will make the rivers islands and i will dry up the pools and i will bring the blind by a way that they knew not i will lead them in paths that they have not known i will make darkness light before them and crooked things straight these things will i do unto them and not forsake them they shall be turned back they shall be greatly ashamed that trust in graven images that say to the molten images ye are our gods hear ye deaf and look ye blind that ye may see who is blind but my servant or deaf as my messenger that i sent who is blind as he that is perfect and blind as the lords servant seeing many things but thou observest not opening the ears but he heareth not the lord is well pleased for his righteousness sake he will magnify the law and make it honourable but this is a people robbed and spoiled they are
