of ramah and dwelt in tirzah then king asa made a proclamation throughout all judah none was exempted and they took away the stones of ramah and the timber thereof wherewith baasha had builded and king asa built with them geba of benjamin and mizpah the rest of all the acts of asa and all his might and all that he did and the cities which he built are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet and asa slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david his father and jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead and nadab the son of jeroboam began to reign over israel in the second year of asa king of judah and reigned over israel two years and he did evil in the sight of the lord and walked in the way of his father and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin and baasha the son of ahijah of the house of issachar conspired against him and baasha smote him at gibbethon which belonged to the philistines for nadab and all israel laid siege to gibbethon even in the third year of asa king of judah did baasha slay him and reigned in his stead and it came to pass when he reigned that he smote all the house of jeroboam he left not to jeroboam any that breathed until he had destroyed him according unto the saying of the lord which he spake by his servant ahijah the shilonite because of the sins of jeroboam which he sinned and which he made israel sin by his provocation wherewith he provoked the lord god of israel to anger now the rest of the acts of nadab and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel and there was war between asa and baasha king of israel all their days in the third year of asa king of judah began baasha the son of ahijah to reign over all israel in tirzah twenty and four years and he did evil in the sight of the lord and walked in the way of jeroboam and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin then the word of the lord came to jehu the son of hanani against baasha saying forasmuch as i exalted thee out of the dust and made thee prince over my people israel and thou hast walked in the way of jeroboam and hast made my people israel to sin to provoke me to anger with their sins behold i will take away the posterity of baasha and the posterity of his house and will make thy house like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat him that dieth of baasha in the city shall the dogs eat and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat now the rest of the acts of baasha and what he did and his might are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel so baasha slept with his fathers and was buried in tirzah and elah his son reigned in his stead and also by the hand of the prophet jehu the son of hanani came the word of the lord against baasha and against his house even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the lord in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands in being like the house of jeroboam and because he killed him in the twenty and sixth year of asa king of judah began elah the son of baasha to reign over israel in tirzah two years and his servant zimri captain of half his chariots conspired against him as he was in tirzah drinking himself drunk in the house of arza steward of his house in tirzah and zimri went in and smote him and killed him in the twenty and seventh year of asa king of judah and reigned in his stead and it came to pass when he began to reign as soon as he sat on his throne that he slew all the house of baasha he left him not one that pisseth against a wall neither of his kinsfolks nor of his friends thus did zimri destroy all the house of baasha according to the word of the lord which he spake against baasha by jehu the prophet for all the sins of baasha and the sins of elah his son by which they sinned and by which they made israel to sin in provoking the lord god of israel to anger with their vanities now the rest of the acts of elah and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel in the twenty and seventh year of asa king of judah did zimri reign seven days in tirzah and the people were encamped against gibbethon which belonged to the philistines and the people that were encamped heard say zimri hath conspired and hath also slain the king wherefore all israel made omri the captain of the host king over israel that day in the camp and omri went up from gibbethon and all israel with him and they besieged tirzah and it came to pass when zimri saw that the city was taken that he went into the palace of the kings house and burnt the kings house over him with fire and died for his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the lord in walking in the way of jeroboam and in his sin which he did to make israel to sin now the rest of the acts of zimri and his treason that he wrought are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel then were the people of israel divided into two parts half of the people followed tibni the son of ginath to make him king and half followed omri but the people that followed omri prevailed against the people that followed tibni the son of ginath so tibni died and omri
