hast forsaken me the lord shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee until he have consumed thee from off the land whither thou goest to possess it the lord shall smite thee with a consumption and with a fever and with an inflammation and with an extreme burning and with the sword and with blasting and with mildew and they shall pursue thee until thou perish and thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass and the earth that is under thee shall be iron the lord shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust from heaven shall it come down upon thee until thou be destroyed the lord shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies thou shalt go out one way against them and flee seven ways before them and shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth and thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air and unto the beasts of the earth and no man shall fray them away the lord will smite thee with the botch of egypt and with the emerods and with the scab and with the itch whereof thou canst not be healed the lord shall smite thee with madness and blindness and astonishment of heart and thou shalt grope at noonday as the blind gropeth in darkness and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways and thou shalt be only oppressed and spoiled evermore and no man shall save thee thou shalt betroth a wife and another man shall lie with her thou shalt build an house and thou shalt not dwell therein thou shalt plant a vineyard and shalt not gather the grapes thereof thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes and thou shalt not eat thereof thine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face and shall not be restored to thee thy sheep shall be given unto thine enemies and thou shalt have none to rescue them thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people and thine eyes shall look and fail with longing for them all the day long and there shall be no might in thine hand the fruit of thy land and all thy labours shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway so that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see the lord shall smite thee in the knees and in the legs with a sore botch that cannot be healed from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy head the lord shall bring thee and thy king which thou shalt set over thee unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have known and there shalt thou serve other gods wood and stone and thou shalt become an astonishment a proverb and a byword among all nations whither the lord shall lead thee thou shalt carry much seed out into the field and shalt gather but little in for the locust shall consume it thou shalt plant vineyards and dress them but shalt neither drink of the wine nor gather the grapes for the worms shall eat them thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil for thine olive shall cast his fruit thou shalt beget sons and daughters but thou shalt not enjoy them for they shall go into captivity all thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume the stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very high and thou shalt come down very low he shall lend to thee and thou shalt not lend to him he shall be the head and thou shalt be the tail moreover all these curses shall come upon thee and shall pursue thee and overtake thee till thou be destroyed because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the lord thy god to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee and they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder and upon thy seed for ever because thou servedst not the lord thy god with joyfulness and with gladness of heart for the abundance of all things therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the lord shall send against thee in hunger and in thirst and in nakedness and in want of all things and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck until he have destroyed thee the lord shall bring a nation against thee from far from the end of the earth as swift as the eagle flieth a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand a nation of fierce countenance which shall not regard the person of the old nor shew favour to the young and he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle and the fruit of thy land until thou be destroyed which also shall not leave thee either corn wine or oil or the increase of thy kine or flocks of thy sheep until he have destroyed thee and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates until thy high and fenced walls come down wherein thou trustedst throughout all thy land and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land which the lord thy god hath given thee and thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters which the lord thy god hath given thee in the siege and in the straitness wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee so that the man that is tender among you and very delicate his eye shall be evil toward his brother and toward the wife of his bosom and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat because he hath nothing left him in the siege and in the straitness wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates the tender and delicate woman among you which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom and toward her son and
