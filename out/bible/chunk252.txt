mocked him and said unto him go up thou bald head go up thou bald head and he turned back and looked on them and cursed them in the name of the lord and there came forth two she bears out of the wood and tare forty and two children of them and he went from thence to mount carmel and from thence he returned to samaria now jehoram the son of ahab began to reign over israel in samaria the eighteenth year of jehoshaphat king of judah and reigned twelve years and he wrought evil in the sight of the lord but not like his father and like his mother for he put away the image of baal that his father had made nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat which made israel to sin he departed not therefrom and mesha king of moab was a sheepmaster and rendered unto the king of israel an hundred thousand lambs and an hundred thousand rams with the wool but it came to pass when ahab was dead that the king of moab rebelled against the king of israel and king jehoram went out of samaria the same time and numbered all israel and he went and sent to jehoshaphat the king of judah saying the king of moab hath rebelled against me wilt thou go with me against moab to battle and he said i will go up i am as thou art my people as thy people and my horses as thy horses and he said which way shall we go up and he answered the way through the wilderness of edom so the king of israel went and the king of judah and the king of edom and they fetched a compass of seven days journey and there was no water for the host and for the cattle that followed them and the king of israel said alas that the lord hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of moab but jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord that we may enquire of the lord by him and one of the king of israels servants answered and said here is elisha the son of shaphat which poured water on the hands of elijah and jehoshaphat said the word of the lord is with him so the king of israel and jehoshaphat and the king of edom went down to him and elisha said unto the king of israel what have i to do with thee get thee to the prophets of thy father and to the prophets of thy mother and the king of israel said unto him nay for the lord hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of moab and elisha said as the lord of hosts liveth before whom i stand surely were it not that i regard the presence of jehoshaphat the king of judah i would not look toward thee nor see thee but now bring me a minstrel and it came to pass when the minstrel played that the hand of the lord came upon him and he said thus saith the lord make this valley full of ditches for thus saith the lord ye shall not see wind neither shall ye see rain yet that valley shall be filled with water that ye may drink both ye and your cattle and your beasts and this is but a light thing in the sight of the lord he will deliver the moabites also into your hand and ye shall smite every fenced city and every choice city and shall fell every good tree and stop all wells of water and mar every good piece of land with stones and it came to pass in the morning when the meat offering was offered that behold there came water by the way of edom and the country was filled with water and when all the moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them they gathered all that were able to put on armour and upward and stood in the border and they rose up early in the morning and the sun shone upon the water and the moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood and they said this is blood the kings are surely slain and they have smitten one another now therefore moab to the spoil and when they came to the camp of israel the israelites rose up and smote the moabites so that they fled before them but they went forward smiting the moabites even in their country and they beat down the cities and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone and filled it and they stopped all the wells of water and felled all the good trees only in kirharaseth left they the stones thereof howbeit the slingers went about it and smote it and when the king of moab saw that the battle was too sore for him he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords to break through even unto the king of edom but they could not then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall and there was great indignation against israel and they departed from him and returned to their own land now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto elisha saying thy servant my husband is dead and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the lord and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen and elisha said unto her what shall i do for thee tell me what hast thou in the house and she said thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house save a pot of oil then he said go borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours even empty vessels borrow not a few and when thou art come in thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons and shalt pour out into all those vessels and thou shalt set aside that which is full so she went from him and shut the door upon her and upon her sons
