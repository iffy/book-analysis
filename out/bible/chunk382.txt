me i will walk within my house with a perfect heart i will set no wicked thing before mine eyes i hate the work of them that turn aside it shall not cleave to me a froward heart shall depart from me i will not know a wicked person whoso privily slandereth his neighbour him will i cut off him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not i suffer mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land that they may dwell with me he that walketh in a perfect way he shall serve me he that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight i will early destroy all the wicked of the land that i may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the lord hear my prayer o lord and let my cry come unto thee hide not thy face from me in the day when i am in trouble incline thine ear unto me in the day when i call answer me speedily for my days are consumed like smoke and my bones are burned as an hearth my heart is smitten and withered like grass so that i forget to eat my bread by reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin i am like a pelican of the wilderness i am like an owl of the desert i watch and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top mine enemies reproach me all the day and they that are mad against me are sworn against me for i have eaten ashes like bread and mingled my drink with weeping because of thine indignation and thy wrath for thou hast lifted me up and cast me down my days are like a shadow that declineth and i am withered like grass but thou o lord shall endure for ever and thy remembrance unto all generations thou shalt arise and have mercy upon zion for the time to favour her yea the set time is come for thy servants take pleasure in her stones and favour the dust thereof so the heathen shall fear the name of the lord and all the kings of the earth thy glory when the lord shall build up zion he shall appear in his glory he will regard the prayer of the destitute and not despise their prayer this shall be written for the generation to come and the people which shall be created shall praise the lord for he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary from heaven did the lord behold the earth to hear the groaning of the prisoner to loose those that are appointed to death to declare the name of the lord in zion and his praise in jerusalem when the people are gathered together and the kingdoms to serve the lord he weakened my strength in the way he shortened my days i said o my god take me not away in the midst of my days thy years are throughout all generations of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the work of thy hands they shall perish but thou shalt endure yea all of them shall wax old like a garment as a vesture shalt thou change them and they shall be changed but thou art the same and thy years shall have no end the children of thy servants shall continue and their seed shall be established before thee bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name bless the lord o my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies who satisfieth thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles the lord executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed he made known his ways unto moses his acts unto the children of israel the lord is merciful and gracious slow to anger and plenteous in mercy he will not always chide neither will he keep his anger for ever he hath not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities for as the heaven is high above the earth so great is his mercy toward them that fear him as far as the east is from the west so far hath he removed our transgressions from us like as a father pitieth his children so the lord pitieth them that fear him for he knoweth our frame he remembereth that we are dust as for man his days are as grass as a flower of the field so he flourisheth for the wind passeth over it and it is gone and the place thereof shall know it no more but the mercy of the lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him and his righteousness unto childrens children to such as keep his covenant and to those that remember his commandments to do them the lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens and his kingdom ruleth over all bless the lord ye his angels that excel in strength that do his commandments hearkening unto the voice of his word bless ye the lord all ye his hosts ye ministers of his that do his pleasure bless the lord all his works in all places of his dominion bless the lord o my soul bless the lord o my soul o lord my god thou art very great thou art clothed with honour and majesty who coverest thyself with light as with a garment who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters who maketh the clouds his chariot who walketh upon the wings of the wind who maketh his angels spirits his ministers a flaming fire who laid the foundations of the earth that it should not be removed for ever thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment the waters stood above the mountains at thy rebuke they fled at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away they go up by the mountains they go down by
