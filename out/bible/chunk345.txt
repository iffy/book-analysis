put out with him the steps of his strength shall be straitened and his own counsel shall cast him down for he is cast into a net by his own feet and he walketh upon a snare the gin shall take him by the heel and the robber shall prevail against him the snare is laid for him in the ground and a trap for him in the way terrors shall make him afraid on every side and shall drive him to his feet his strength shall be hungerbitten and destruction shall be ready at his side it shall devour the strength of his skin even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength his confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle and it shall bring him to the king of terrors it shall dwell in his tabernacle because it is none of his brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation his roots shall be dried up beneath and above shall his branch be cut off his remembrance shall perish from the earth and he shall have no name in the street he shall be driven from light into darkness and chased out of the world he shall neither have son nor nephew among his people nor any remaining in his dwellings they that come after him shall be astonied at his day as they that went before were affrighted surely such are the dwellings of the wicked and this is the place of him that knoweth not god then job answered and said how long will ye vex my soul and break me in pieces with words these ten times have ye reproached me ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me and be it indeed that i have erred mine error remaineth with myself if indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me and plead against me my reproach know now that god hath overthrown me and hath compassed me with his net behold i cry out of wrong but i am not heard i cry aloud but there is no judgment he hath fenced up my way that i cannot pass and he hath set darkness in my paths he hath stripped me of my glory and taken the crown from my head he hath destroyed me on every side and i am gone and mine hope hath he removed like a tree he hath also kindled his wrath against me and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies his troops come together and raise up their way against me and encamp round about my tabernacle he hath put my brethren far from me and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me my kinsfolk have failed and my familiar friends have forgotten me they that dwell in mine house and my maids count me for a stranger i am an alien in their sight i called my servant and he gave me no answer i intreated him with my mouth my breath is strange to my wife though i intreated for the childrens sake of mine own body yea young children despised me i arose and they spake against me all my inward friends abhorred me and they whom i loved are turned against me my bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh and i am escaped with the skin of my teeth have pity upon me have pity upon me o ye my friends for the hand of god hath touched me why do ye persecute me as god and are not satisfied with my flesh oh that my words were now written oh that they were printed in a book that they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever for i know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall i see god whom i shall see for myself and mine eyes shall behold and not another though my reins be consumed within me but ye should say why persecute we him seeing the root of the matter is found in me be ye afraid of the sword for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword that ye may know there is a judgment then answered zophar the naamathite and said therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer and for this i make haste i have heard the check of my reproach and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer knowest thou not this of old since man was placed upon earth that the triumphing of the wicked is short and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment though his excellency mount up to the heavens and his head reach unto the clouds yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung they which have seen him shall say where is he he shall fly away as a dream and shall not be found yea he shall be chased away as a vision of the night the eye also which saw him shall see him no more neither shall his place any more behold him his children shall seek to please the poor and his hands shall restore their goods his bones are full of the sin of his youth which shall lie down with him in the dust though wickedness be sweet in his mouth though he hide it under his tongue though he spare it and forsake it not but keep it still within his mouth yet his meat in his bowels is turned it is the gall of asps within him he hath swallowed down riches and he shall vomit them up again god shall cast them out of his belly he shall suck the poison of asps the vipers tongue shall slay him he shall not see the rivers the floods the brooks of honey and butter that which he laboured for shall he restore and shall not swallow it down according to his substance shall the restitution be and he shall not rejoice therein because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly he shall not save of that which he desired there shall none
