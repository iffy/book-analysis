sick of the palsy arise take up thy bed and go unto thine house and he arose and departed to his house but when the multitudes saw it they marvelled and glorified god which had given such power unto men and as jesus passed forth from thence he saw a man named matthew sitting at the receipt of custom and he saith unto him follow me and he arose and followed him and it came to pass as jesus sat at meat in the house behold many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples and when the pharisees saw it they said unto his disciples why eateth your master with publicans and sinners but when jesus heard that he said unto them they that be whole need not a physician but they that are sick but go ye and learn what that meaneth i will have mercy and not sacrifice for i am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance then came to him the disciples of john saying why do we and the pharisees fast oft but thy disciples fast not and jesus said unto them can the children of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them and then shall they fast no man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment and the rent is made worse neither do men put new wine into old bottles else the bottles break and the wine runneth out and the bottles perish but they put new wine into new bottles and both are preserved while he spake these things unto them behold there came a certain ruler and worshipped him saying my daughter is even now dead but come and lay thy hand upon her and she shall live and jesus arose and followed him and so did his disciples and behold a woman which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years came behind him and touched the hem of his garment for she said within herself if i may but touch his garment i shall be whole but jesus turned him about and when he saw her he said daughter be of good comfort thy faith hath made thee whole and the woman was made whole from that hour and when jesus came into the rulers house and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise he said unto them give place for the maid is not dead but sleepeth and they laughed him to scorn but when the people were put forth he went in and took her by the hand and the maid arose and the fame hereof went abroad into all that land and when jesus departed thence two blind men followed him crying and saying thou son of david have mercy on us and when he was come into the house the blind men came to him and jesus saith unto them believe ye that i am able to do this they said unto him yea lord then touched he their eyes saying according to your faith be it unto you and their eyes were opened and jesus straitly charged them saying see that no man know it but they when they were departed spread abroad his fame in all that country as they went out behold they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil and when the devil was cast out the dumb spake and the multitudes marvelled saying it was never so seen in israel but the pharisees said he casteth out devils through the prince of the devils and jesus went about all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every disease among the people but when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd then saith he unto his disciples the harvest truly is plenteous but the labourers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he will send forth labourers into his harvest and when he had called unto him his twelve disciples he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease now the names of the twelve apostles are these the first simon who is called peter and andrew his brother james the son of zebedee and john his brother philip and bartholomew thomas and matthew the publican james the son of alphaeus and lebbaeus whose surname was thaddaeus simon the canaanite and judas iscariot who also betrayed him these twelve jesus sent forth and commanded them saying go not into the way of the gentiles and into any city of the samaritans enter ye not but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of israel and as ye go preach saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead cast out devils freely ye have received freely give provide neither gold nor silver nor brass in your purses nor scrip for your journey neither two coats neither shoes nor yet staves for the workman is worthy of his meat and into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter enquire who in it is worthy and there abide till ye go thence and when ye come into an house salute it and if the house be worthy let your peace come upon it but if it be not worthy let your peace return to you and whosoever shall not receive you nor hear your words when ye depart out of that house or city shake off the dust of your feet verily i say unto you it shall be more tolerable for the land of sodom and gomorrha in the day of judgment than for that city behold i send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves but beware of men for they will deliver you up to the councils and they will scourge you in their synagogues and ye shall be brought before
