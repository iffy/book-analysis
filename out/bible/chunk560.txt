him that giveth his neighbour drink that puttest thy bottle to him and makest him drunken also that thou mayest look on their nakedness thou art filled with shame for glory drink thou also and let thy foreskin be uncovered the cup of the lords right hand shall be turned unto thee and shameful spewing shall be on thy glory for the violence of lebanon shall cover thee and the spoil of beasts which made them afraid because of mens blood and for the violence of the land of the city and of all that dwell therein what profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it the molten image and a teacher of lies that the maker of his work trusteth therein to make dumb idols woe unto him that saith to the wood awake to the dumb stone arise it shall teach behold it is laid over with gold and silver and there is no breath at all in the midst of it but the lord is in his holy temple let all the earth keep silence before him a prayer of habakkuk the prophet upon shigionoth o lord i have heard thy speech and was afraid o lord revive thy work in the midst of the years in the midst of the years make known in wrath remember mercy god came from teman and the holy one from mount paran selah his glory covered the heavens and the earth was full of his praise and his brightness was as the light he had horns coming out of his hand and there was the hiding of his power before him went the pestilence and burning coals went forth at his feet he stood and measured the earth he beheld and drove asunder the nations and the everlasting mountains were scattered the perpetual hills did bow his ways are everlasting i saw the tents of cushan in affliction and the curtains of the land of midian did tremble was the lord displeased against the rivers was thine anger against the rivers was thy wrath against the sea that thou didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation thy bow was made quite naked according to the oaths of the tribes even thy word selah thou didst cleave the earth with rivers the mountains saw thee and they trembled the overflowing of the water passed by the deep uttered his voice and lifted up his hands on high the sun and moon stood still in their habitation at the light of thine arrows they went and at the shining of thy glittering spear thou didst march through the land in indignation thou didst thresh the heathen in anger thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people even for salvation with thine anointed thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked by discovering the foundation unto the neck selah thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses through the heap of great waters when i heard my belly trembled my lips quivered at the voice rottenness entered into my bones and i trembled in myself that i might rest in the day of trouble when he cometh up unto the people he will invade them with his troops although the fig tree shall not blossom neither shall fruit be in the vines the labour of the olive shall fail and the fields shall yield no meat the flock shall be cut off from the fold and there shall be no herd in the stalls yet i will rejoice in the lord i will joy in the god of my salvation the lord god is my strength and he will make my feet like hinds feet and he will make me to walk upon mine high places to the chief singer on my stringed instruments zephaniah the word of the lord which came unto zephaniah the son of cushi the son of gedaliah the son of amariah the son of hizkiah in the days of josiah the son of amon king of judah i will utterly consume all things from off the land saith the lord i will consume man and beast i will consume the fowls of the heaven and the fishes of the sea and the stumbling blocks with the wicked and i will cut off man from off the land saith the lord i will also stretch out mine hand upon judah and upon all the inhabitants of jerusalem and i will cut off the remnant of baal from this place and the name of the chemarims with the priests and them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops and them that worship and that swear by the lord and that swear by malcham and them that are turned back from the lord and those that have not sought the lord nor enquired for him hold thy peace at the presence of the lord god for the day of the lord is at hand for the lord hath prepared a sacrifice he hath bid his guests and it shall come to pass in the day of the lords sacrifice that i will punish the princes and the kings children and all such as are clothed with strange apparel in the same day also will i punish all those that leap on the threshold which fill their masters houses with violence and deceit and it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord that there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate and an howling from the second and a great crashing from the hills howl ye inhabitants of maktesh for all the merchant people are cut down all they that bear silver are cut off and it shall come to pass at that time that i will search jerusalem with candles and punish the men that are settled on their lees that say in their heart the lord will not do good neither will he do evil therefore their goods shall become a booty and their houses a desolation they shall also build houses but not inhabit them and they shall plant vineyards but not drink the wine thereof the
