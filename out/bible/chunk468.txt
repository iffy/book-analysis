i will build them and not pull them down and i will plant them and not pluck them up and i will give them an heart to know me that i am the lord and they shall be my people and i will be their god for they shall return unto me with their whole heart and as the evil figs which cannot be eaten they are so evil surely thus saith the lord so will i give zedekiah the king of judah and his princes and the residue of jerusalem that remain in this land and them that dwell in the land of egypt and i will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt to be a reproach and a proverb a taunt and a curse in all places whither i shall drive them and i will send the sword the famine and the pestilence among them till they be consumed from off the land that i gave unto them and to their fathers the word that came to jeremiah concerning all the people of judah in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah that was the first year of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon the which jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of judah and to all the inhabitants of jerusalem saying from the thirteenth year of josiah the son of amon king of judah even unto this day that is the three and twentieth year the word of the lord hath come unto me and i have spoken unto you rising early and speaking but ye have not hearkened and the lord hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets rising early and sending them but ye have not hearkened nor inclined your ear to hear they said turn ye again now every one from his evil way and from the evil of your doings and dwell in the land that the lord hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever and go not after other gods to serve them and to worship them and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands and i will do you no hurt yet ye have not hearkened unto me saith the lord that ye might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt therefore thus saith the lord of hosts because ye have not heard my words behold i will send and take all the families of the north saith the lord and nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon my servant and will bring them against this land and against the inhabitants thereof and against all these nations round about and will utterly destroy them and make them an astonishment and an hissing and perpetual desolations moreover i will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride the sound of the millstones and the light of the candle and this whole land shall be a desolation and an astonishment and these nations shall serve the king of babylon seventy years and it shall come to pass when seventy years are accomplished that i will punish the king of babylon and that nation saith the lord for their iniquity and the land of the chaldeans and will make it perpetual desolations and i will bring upon that land all my words which i have pronounced against it even all that is written in this book which jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations for many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also and i will recompense them according to their deeds and according to the works of their own hands for thus saith the lord god of israel unto me take the wine cup of this fury at my hand and cause all the nations to whom i send thee to drink it and they shall drink and be moved and be mad because of the sword that i will send among them then took i the cup at the lords hand and made all the nations to drink unto whom the lord had sent me to wit jerusalem and the cities of judah and the kings thereof and the princes thereof to make them a desolation an astonishment an hissing and a curse as it is this day pharaoh king of egypt and his servants and his princes and all his people and all the mingled people and all the kings of the land of uz and all the kings of the land of the philistines and ashkelon and azzah and ekron and the remnant of ashdod edom and moab and the children of ammon and all the kings of tyrus and all the kings of zidon and the kings of the isles which are beyond the sea dedan and tema and buz and all that are in the utmost corners and all the kings of arabia and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert and all the kings of zimri and all the kings of elam and all the kings of the medes and all the kings of the north far and near one with another and all the kingdoms of the world which are upon the face of the earth and the king of sheshach shall drink after them therefore thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel drink ye and be drunken and spue and fall and rise no more because of the sword which i will send among you and it shall be if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink then shalt thou say unto them thus saith the lord of hosts ye shall certainly drink for lo i begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name and should ye be utterly unpunished ye shall not be unpunished for i will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth saith the lord of hosts therefore prophesy thou against them all these words and say unto them the lord shall roar from on high and utter his voice from his holy habitation he shall mightily roar upon his habitation he shall give a shout
