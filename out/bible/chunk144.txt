good courage for thou must go with this people unto the land which the lord hath sworn unto their fathers to give them and thou shalt cause them to inherit it and the lord he it is that doth go before thee he will be with thee he will not fail thee neither forsake thee fear not neither be dismayed and moses wrote this law and delivered it unto the priests the sons of levi which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord and unto all the elders of israel and moses commanded them saying at the end of every seven years in the solemnity of the year of release in the feast of tabernacles when all israel is come to appear before the lord thy god in the place which he shall choose thou shalt read this law before all israel in their hearing gather the people together men and women and children and thy stranger that is within thy gates that they may hear and that they may learn and fear the lord your god and observe to do all the words of this law and that their children which have not known any thing may hear and learn to fear the lord your god as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over jordan to possess it and the lord said unto moses behold thy days approach that thou must die call joshua and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation that i may give him a charge and moses and joshua went and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation and the lord appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle and the lord said unto moses behold thou shalt sleep with thy fathers and this people will rise up and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land whither they go to be among them and will forsake me and break my covenant which i have made with them then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day and i will forsake them and i will hide my face from them and they shall be devoured and many evils and troubles shall befall them so that they will say in that day are not these evils come upon us because our god is not among us and i will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought in that they are turned unto other gods now therefore write ye this song for you and teach it the children of israel put it in their mouths that this song may be a witness for me against the children of israel for when i shall have brought them into the land which i sware unto their fathers that floweth with milk and honey and they shall have eaten and filled themselves and waxen fat then will they turn unto other gods and serve them and provoke me and break my covenant and it shall come to pass when many evils and troubles are befallen them that this song shall testify against them as a witness for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed for i know their imagination which they go about even now before i have brought them into the land which i sware moses therefore wrote this song the same day and taught it the children of israel and he gave joshua the son of nun a charge and said be strong and of a good courage for thou shalt bring the children of israel into the land which i sware unto them and i will be with thee and it came to pass when moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book until they were finished that moses commanded the levites which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord saying take this book of the law and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the lord your god that it may be there for a witness against thee for i know thy rebellion and thy stiff neck behold while i am yet alive with you this day ye have been rebellious against the lord and how much more after my death gather unto me all the elders of your tribes and your officers that i may speak these words in their ears and call heaven and earth to record against them for i know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves and turn aside from the way which i have commanded you and evil will befall you in the latter days because ye will do evil in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands and moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of israel the words of this song until they were ended give ear o ye heavens and i will speak and hear o earth the words of my mouth my doctrine shall drop as the rain my speech shall distil as the dew as the small rain upon the tender herb and as the showers upon the grass because i will publish the name of the lord ascribe ye greatness unto our god he is the rock his work is perfect for all his ways are judgment a god of truth and without iniquity just and right is he they have corrupted themselves their spot is not the spot of his children they are a perverse and crooked generation do ye thus requite the lord o foolish people and unwise is not he thy father that hath bought thee hath he not made thee and established thee remember the days of old consider the years of many generations ask thy father and he will shew thee thy elders and they will tell thee when the most high divided to the nations their inheritance when he separated the sons of adam he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of israel for the lords portion is his people jacob is the lot of his inheritance he found him in a desert land and in the waste howling
