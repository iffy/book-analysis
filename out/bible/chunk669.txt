a convenient season i will call for thee he hoped also that money should have been given him of paul that he might loose him wherefore he sent for him the oftener and communed with him but after two years porcius festus came into felix room and felix willing to shew the jews a pleasure left paul bound now when festus was come into the province after three days he ascended from caesarea to jerusalem then the high priest and the chief of the jews informed him against paul and besought him and desired favour against him that he would send for him to jerusalem laying wait in the way to kill him but festus answered that paul should be kept at caesarea and that he himself would depart shortly thither let them therefore said he which among you are able go down with me and accuse this man if there be any wickedness in him and when he had tarried among them more than ten days he went down unto caesarea and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded paul to be brought and when he was come the jews which came down from jerusalem stood round about and laid many and grievous complaints against paul which they could not prove while he answered for himself neither against the law of the jews neither against the temple nor yet against caesar have i offended any thing at all but festus willing to do the jews a pleasure answered paul and said wilt thou go up to jerusalem and there be judged of these things before me then said paul i stand at caesars judgment seat where i ought to be judged to the jews have i done no wrong as thou very well knowest for if i be an offender or have committed any thing worthy of death i refuse not to die but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me no man may deliver me unto them i appeal unto caesar then festus when he had conferred with the council answered hast thou appealed unto caesar unto caesar shalt thou go and after certain days king agrippa and bernice came unto caesarea to salute festus and when they had been there many days festus declared pauls cause unto the king saying there is a certain man left in bonds by felix about whom when i was at jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the jews informed me desiring to have judgment against him to whom i answered it is not the manner of the romans to deliver any man to die before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him therefore when they were come hither without any delay on the morrow i sat on the judgment seat and commanded the man to be brought forth against whom when the accusers stood up they brought none accusation of such things as i supposed but had certain questions against him of their own superstition and of one jesus which was dead whom paul affirmed to be alive and because i doubted of such manner of questions i asked him whether he would go to jerusalem and there be judged of these matters but when paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of augustus i commanded him to be kept till i might send him to caesar then agrippa said unto festus i would also hear the man myself to morrow said he thou shalt hear him and on the morrow when agrippa was come and bernice with great pomp and was entered into the place of hearing with the chief captains and principal men of the city at festus commandment paul was brought forth and festus said king agrippa and all men which are here present with us ye see this man about whom all the multitude of the jews have dealt with me both at jerusalem and also here crying that he ought not to live any longer but when i found that he had committed nothing worthy of death and that he himself hath appealed to augustus i have determined to send him of whom i have no certain thing to write unto my lord wherefore i have brought him forth before you and specially before thee o king agrippa that after examination had i might have somewhat to write for it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him then agrippa said unto paul thou art permitted to speak for thyself then paul stretched forth the hand and answered for himself i think myself happy king agrippa because i shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof i am accused of the jews especially because i know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the jews wherefore i beseech thee to hear me patiently my manner of life from my youth which was at the first among mine own nation at jerusalem know all the jews which knew me from the beginning if they would testify that after the most straitest sect of our religion i lived a pharisee and now i stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of god unto our fathers unto which promise our twelve tribes instantly serving god day and night hope to come for which hopes sake king agrippa i am accused of the jews why should it be thought a thing incredible with you that god should raise the dead i verily thought with myself that i ought to do many things contrary to the name of jesus of nazareth which thing i also did in jerusalem and many of the saints did i shut up in prison having received authority from the chief priests and when they were put to death i gave my voice against them and i punished them oft in every synagogue and compelled them to blaspheme and being exceedingly mad against them i persecuted them even unto strange cities whereupon as i went to damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests at midday o king i saw in the way a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun
