it he will answer thee and though the lord give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more but thine eyes shall see thy teachers and thine ears shall hear a word behind thee saying this is the way walk ye in it when ye turn to the right hand and when ye turn to the left ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver and the ornament of thy molten images of gold thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth thou shalt say unto it get thee hence then shall he give the rain of thy seed that thou shalt sow the ground withal and bread of the increase of the earth and it shall be fat and plenteous in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures the oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan and there shall be upon every high mountain and upon every high hill rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter when the towers fall moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold as the light of seven days in the day that the lord bindeth up the breach of his people and healeth the stroke of their wound behold the name of the lord cometh from far burning with his anger and the burden thereof is heavy his lips are full of indignation and his tongue as a devouring fire and his breath as an overflowing stream shall reach to the midst of the neck to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people causing them to err ye shall have a song as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept and gladness of heart as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the lord to the mighty one of israel and the lord shall cause his glorious voice to be heard and shall shew the lighting down of his arm with the indignation of his anger and with the flame of a devouring fire with scattering and tempest and hailstones for through the voice of the lord shall the assyrian be beaten down which smote with a rod and in every place where the grounded staff shall pass which the lord shall lay upon him it shall be with tabrets and harps and in battles of shaking will he fight with it for tophet is ordained of old yea for the king it is prepared he hath made it deep and large the pile thereof is fire and much wood the breath of the lord like a stream of brimstone doth kindle it woe to them that go down to egypt for help and stay on horses and trust in chariots because they are many and in horsemen because they are very strong but they look not unto the holy one of israel neither seek the lord yet he also is wise and will bring evil and will not call back his words but will arise against the house of the evildoers and against the help of them that work iniquity now the egyptians are men and not god and their horses flesh and not spirit when the lord shall stretch out his hand both he that helpeth shall fall and he that is holpen shall fall down and they all shall fail together for thus hath the lord spoken unto me like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him he will not be afraid of their voice nor abase himself for the noise of them so shall the lord of hosts come down to fight for mount zion and for the hill thereof as birds flying so will the lord of hosts defend jerusalem defending also he will deliver it and passing over he will preserve it turn ye unto him from whom the children of israel have deeply revolted for in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold which your own hands have made unto you for a sin then shall the assyrian fall with the sword not of a mighty man and the sword not of a mean man shall devour him but he shall flee from the sword and his young men shall be discomfited and he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign saith the lord whose fire is in zion and his furnace in jerusalem behold a king shall reign in righteousness and princes shall rule in judgment and a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind and a covert from the tempest as rivers of water in a dry place as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land and the eyes of them that see shall not be dim and the ears of them that hear shall hearken the heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly the vile person shall be no more called liberal nor the churl said to be bountiful for the vile person will speak villany and his heart will work iniquity to practise hypocrisy and to utter error against the lord to make empty the soul of the hungry and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail the instruments also of the churl are evil he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words even when the needy speaketh right but the liberal deviseth liberal things and by liberal things shall he stand rise up ye women that are at ease hear my voice ye careless daughters give ear unto my speech many days and years shall ye be troubled ye careless women for the vintage shall fail the gathering shall not come tremble ye women that are at ease be troubled ye careless ones strip you and make you bare and gird
