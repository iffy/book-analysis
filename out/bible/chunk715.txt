of the soul both sure and stedfast and which entereth into that within the veil whither the forerunner is for us entered even jesus made an high priest for ever after the order of melchisedec for this melchisedec king of salem priest of the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of salem which is king of peace without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the son of god abideth a priest continually now consider how great this man was unto whom even the patriarch abraham gave the tenth of the spoils and verily they that are of the sons of levi who receive the office of the priesthood have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law that is of their brethren though they come out of the loins of abraham but he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of abraham and blessed him that had the promises and without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better and here men that die receive tithes but there he receiveth them of whom it is witnessed that he liveth and as i may so say levi also who receiveth tithes payed tithes in abraham for he was yet in the loins of his father when melchisedec met him if therefore perfection were by the levitical priesthood for under it the people received the law what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of melchisedec and not be called after the order of aaron for the priesthood being changed there is made of necessity a change also of the law for he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe of which no man gave attendance at the altar for it is evident that our lord sprang out of juda of which tribe moses spake nothing concerning priesthood and it is yet far more evident for that after the similitude of melchisedec there ariseth another priest who is made not after the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life for he testifieth thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec for there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did by the which we draw nigh unto god and inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest for those priests were made without an oath but this with an oath by him that said unto him the lord sware and will not repent thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec by so much was jesus made a surety of a better testament and they truly were many priests because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death but this man because he continueth ever hath an unchangeable priesthood wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto god by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them for such an high priest became us who is holy harmless undefiled separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens who needeth not daily as those high priests to offer up sacrifice first for his own sins and then for the peoples for this he did once when he offered up himself for the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity but the word of the oath which was since the law maketh the son who is consecrated for evermore now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum we have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the lord pitched and not man for every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer for if he were on earth he should not be a priest seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things as moses was admonished of god when he was about to make the tabernacle for see saith he that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount but now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant which was established upon better promises for if that first covenant had been faultless then should no place have been sought for the second for finding fault with them he saith behold the days come saith the lord when i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day when i took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of egypt because they continued not in my covenant and i regarded them not saith the lord for this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their mind and write them in their hearts and i will be to them a god and they shall be to me a people and they shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother saying know the lord for all shall know me from the least to the greatest for i will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and their iniquities will i remember no more in that he saith a new covenant he hath made the first old now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service and a worldly sanctuary for there was a tabernacle made the first wherein was the candlestick and the table and the shewbread which is called the sanctuary and
