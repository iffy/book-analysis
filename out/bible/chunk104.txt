too much upon you seeing all the congregation are holy every one of them and the lord is among them wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the lord and when moses heard it he fell upon his face and he spake unto korah and unto all his company saying even to morrow the lord will shew who are his and who is holy and will cause him to come near unto him even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto him this do take you censers korah and all his company and put fire therein and put incense in them before the lord to morrow and it shall be that the man whom the lord doth choose he shall be holy ye take too much upon you ye sons of levi and moses said unto korah hear i pray you ye sons of levi seemeth it but a small thing unto you that the god of israel hath separated you from the congregation of israel to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the lord and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them and he hath brought thee near to him and all thy brethren the sons of levi with thee and seek ye the priesthood also for which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the lord and what is aaron that ye murmur against him and moses sent to call dathan and abiram the sons of eliab which said we will not come up is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards wilt thou put out the eyes of these men we will not come up and moses was very wroth and said unto the lord respect not thou their offering i have not taken one ass from them neither have i hurt one of them and moses said unto korah be thou and all thy company before the lord thou and they and aaron to morrow and take every man his censer and put incense in them and bring ye before the lord every man his censer two hundred and fifty censers thou also and aaron each of you his censer and they took every man his censer and put fire in them and laid incense thereon and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with moses and aaron and korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and the glory of the lord appeared unto all the congregation and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying separate yourselves from among this congregation that i may consume them in a moment and they fell upon their faces and said o god the god of the spirits of all flesh shall one man sin and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the congregation saying get you up from about the tabernacle of korah dathan and abiram and moses rose up and went unto dathan and abiram and the elders of israel followed him and he spake unto the congregation saying depart i pray you from the tents of these wicked men and touch nothing of theirs lest ye be consumed in all their sins so they gat up from the tabernacle of korah dathan and abiram on every side and dathan and abiram came out and stood in the door of their tents and their wives and their sons and their little children and moses said hereby ye shall know that the lord hath sent me to do all these works for i have not done them of mine own mind if these men die the common death of all men or if they be visited after the visitation of all men then the lord hath not sent me but
