over and they slew of moab at that time about ten thousand men all lusty and all men of valour and there escaped not a man so moab was subdued that day under the hand of israel and the land had rest fourscore years and after him was shamgar the son of anath which slew of the philistines six hundred men with an ox goad and he also delivered israel and the children of israel again did evil in the sight of the lord when ehud was dead and the lord sold them into the hand of jabin king of canaan that reigned in hazor the captain of whose host was sisera which dwelt in harosheth of the gentiles and the children of israel cried unto the lord for he had nine hundred chariots of iron and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of israel and deborah a prophetess the wife of lapidoth she judged israel at that time and she dwelt under the palm tree of deborah between ramah and bethel in mount ephraim and the children of israel came up to her for judgment and she sent and called barak the son of abinoam out of kedeshnaphtali and said unto him hath not the lord god of israel commanded saying go and draw toward mount tabor and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of naphtali and of the children of zebulun and i will draw unto thee to the river kishon sisera the captain of jabins army with his chariots and his multitude and i will deliver him into thine hand and barak said unto her if thou wilt go with me then i will go but if thou wilt not go with me then i will not go and she said i will surely go with thee notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour for the lord shall sell sisera into the hand of a woman and deborah arose and went with barak to kedesh and barak called zebulun and naphtali to kedesh and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet and deborah went up with him now heber the kenite which was of the children of hobab the father in law of moses had severed himself from the kenites and pitched his tent unto the plain of zaanaim which is by kedesh and they shewed sisera that barak the son of abinoam was gone up to mount tabor and sisera gathered together all his chariots even nine hundred chariots of iron and all the people that were with him from harosheth of the gentiles unto the river of kishon and deborah said unto barak up for this is the day in which the lord hath delivered sisera into thine hand is not the lord gone out before thee so barak went down from mount tabor and ten thousand men after him and the lord discomfited sisera and all his chariots and all his host with the edge of the sword before barak so that sisera lighted down off his chariot and fled away on his feet but barak pursued after the chariots and after the host unto harosheth of the gentiles and all the host of sisera fell upon the edge of the sword and there was not a man left howbeit sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of jael the wife of heber the kenite for there was peace between jabin the king of hazor and the house of heber the kenite and jael went out to meet sisera and said unto him turn in my lord turn in to me fear not and when he had turned in unto her into the tent she covered him with a mantle and he said unto her give me i pray thee a little water to drink for i am thirsty and she opened a bottle of milk and gave him drink and covered him again he said unto her stand in the door of the tent and it shall be when any man doth come and enquire of thee and say is there any man here that thou shalt say no then jael hebers wife took a nail of the tent and took an hammer in her hand and went softly unto him and smote the nail into his temples and fastened it into the ground for he was fast asleep and weary so he died and behold as barak pursued sisera jael came out to meet him and said unto him come and i will shew thee the man whom thou seekest and when he came into her tent behold sisera lay dead and the nail was in his temples so god subdued on that day jabin the king of canaan before the children of israel and the hand of the children of israel prospered and prevailed against jabin the king of canaan until they had destroyed jabin king of canaan then sang deborah and barak the son of abinoam on that day saying praise ye the lord for the avenging of israel when the people willingly offered themselves hear o ye kings give ear o ye princes i even i will sing unto the lord i will sing praise to the lord god of israel lord when thou wentest out of seir when thou marchedst out of the field of edom the earth trembled and the heavens dropped the clouds also dropped water the mountains melted from before the lord even that sinai from before the lord god of israel in the days of shamgar the son of anath in the days of jael the highways were unoccupied and the travellers walked through byways the inhabitants of the villages ceased they ceased in israel until that i deborah arose that i arose a mother in israel they chose new gods then was war in the gates was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in israel my heart is toward the governors of israel that offered themselves willingly among the people bless ye the lord speak ye that ride on white asses ye that sit in judgment and walk by the way they that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the lord even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of
