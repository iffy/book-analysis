in and stood beside the wheels and one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims and took thereof and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen who took it and went out and there appeared in the cherubims the form of a mans hand under their wings and when i looked behold the four wheels by the cherubims one wheel by one cherub and another wheel by another cherub and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone and as for their appearances they four had one likeness as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel when they went they went upon their four sides they turned not as they went but to the place whither the head looked they followed it they turned not as they went and their whole body and their backs and their hands and their wings and the wheels were full of eyes round about even the wheels that they four had as for the wheels it was cried unto them in my hearing o wheel and every one had four faces the first face was the face of a cherub and the second face was the face of a man and the third the face of a lion and the fourth the face of an eagle and the cherubims were lifted up this is the living creature that i saw by the river of chebar and when the cherubims went the wheels went by them and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth the same wheels also turned not from beside them when they stood these stood and when they were lifted up these lifted up themselves also for the spirit of the living creature was in them then the glory of the lord departed from off the threshold of the house and stood over the cherubims and the cherubims lifted up their wings and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went out the wheels also were beside them and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the lords house and the glory of the god of israel was over them above this is the living creature that i saw under the god of israel by the river of chebar and i knew that they were the cherubims every one had four faces apiece and every one four wings and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings and the likeness of their faces was the same faces which i saw by the river of chebar their appearances and themselves they went every one straight forward moreover the spirit lifted me up and brought me unto the east gate of the lords house which looketh eastward and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men among whom i saw jaazaniah the son of azur and pelatiah the son of benaiah princes of the people then said he unto me son of man these are the men that devise mischief and give wicked counsel in this city which say it is not near let us build houses this city is the caldron and we be the flesh therefore prophesy against them prophesy o son of man and the spirit of the lord fell upon me and said unto me speak thus saith the lord thus have ye said o house of israel for i know the things that come into your mind every one of them ye have multiplied your slain in this city and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain therefore thus saith the lord god your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it they are the flesh and this city is the caldron but i will bring you forth out of the midst of it ye have feared the sword and i will bring a sword upon you saith the lord god and i will bring you out of the midst thereof and deliver you into the hands of strangers and will execute judgments among you ye shall fall by the sword i will judge you in the border of israel and ye shall know that i am the lord this city shall not be your caldron neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof but i will judge you in the border of israel and ye shall know that i am the lord for ye have not walked in my statutes neither executed my judgments but have done after the manners of the heathen that are round about you and it came to pass when i prophesied that pelatiah the son of benaiah died then fell i down upon my face and cried with a loud voice and said ah lord god wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of israel again the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man thy brethren even thy brethren the men of thy kindred and all the house of israel wholly are they unto whom the inhabitants of jerusalem have said get you far from the lord unto us is this land given in possession therefore say thus saith the lord god although i have cast them far off among the heathen and although i have scattered them among the countries yet will i be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come therefore say thus saith the lord god i will even gather you from the people and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered and i will give you the land of israel and they shall come thither and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence and i will give them one heart and i will put a new spirit within you and i will take the stony heart out of their flesh and will give them an heart of flesh that they may walk in my statutes and keep mine ordinances and do them and they shall be my people and i will be their god but as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations i
