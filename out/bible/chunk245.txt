go shew thyself unto ahab and i will send rain upon the earth and elijah went to shew himself unto ahab and there was a sore famine in samaria and ahab called obadiah which was the governor of his house now obadiah feared the lord greatly for it was so when jezebel cut off the prophets of the lord that obadiah took an hundred prophets and hid them by fifty in a cave and fed them with bread and water and ahab said unto obadiah go into the land unto all fountains of water and unto all brooks peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive that we lose not all the beasts so they divided the land between them to pass throughout it ahab went one way by himself and obadiah went another way by himself and as obadiah was in the way behold elijah met him and he knew him and fell on his face and said art thou that my lord elijah and he answered him i am go tell thy lord behold elijah is here and he said what have i sinned that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of ahab to slay me as the lord thy god liveth there is no nation or kingdom whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee and when they said he is not there he took an oath of the kingdom and nation that they found thee not and now thou sayest go tell thy lord behold elijah is here and it shall come to pass as soon as i am gone from thee that the spirit of the lord shall carry thee whither i know not and so when i come and tell ahab and he cannot find thee he shall slay me but i thy servant fear the lord from my youth was it not told my lord what i did when jezebel slew the prophets of the lord how i hid an hundred men of the lords prophets by fifty in a cave and fed them with bread and water and now thou sayest go tell thy lord behold elijah is here and he shall slay me and elijah said as the lord of hosts liveth before whom i stand i will surely shew myself unto him to day so obadiah went to meet ahab and told him and ahab went to meet elijah and it came to pass when ahab saw elijah that ahab said unto him art thou he that troubleth israel and he answered i have not troubled israel but thou and thy fathers house in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the lord and thou hast followed baalim now therefore send and gather to me all israel unto mount carmel and the prophets of baal four hundred and fifty and the prophets of the groves four hundred which eat at jezebels table so ahab sent unto all the children of israel and gathered the prophets together unto mount carmel and elijah came unto all the people and said how long halt ye between two opinions if the lord be god follow him but if baal then follow him and the people answered him not a word then said elijah unto the people i even i only remain a prophet of the lord but baals prophets are four hundred and fifty men let them therefore give us two bullocks and let them choose one bullock for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on wood and put no fire under and i will dress the other bullock and lay it on wood and put no fire under and call ye on the name of your gods and i will call on the name of the lord and the god that answereth by fire let him be god and all the people answered and said it is well spoken and elijah said unto the prophets of baal choose you one bullock for yourselves and dress it first for ye are many and call on the name of your gods but put no fire under and they took the bullock which was given them and they dressed it and called on the name of baal from morning even until noon saying o baal hear us but there was no voice nor any that answered and they leaped upon the altar which was made and it came to pass at noon that elijah mocked them and said cry aloud for he is a god either he is talking or he is pursuing or he is in a journey or peradventure he sleepeth and must be awaked and they cried aloud and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets till the blood gushed out upon them and it came to pass when midday was past and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that there was neither voice nor any to answer nor any that regarded and elijah said unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar of the lord that was broken down and elijah took twelve stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of jacob unto whom the word of the lord came saying israel shall be thy name and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the lord and he made a trench about the altar as great as would contain two measures of seed and he put the wood in order and cut the bullock in pieces and laid him on the wood and said fill four barrels with water and pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood and he said do it the second time and they did it the second time and he said do it the third time and they did it the third time and the water ran round about the altar and he filled the trench also with water and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that elijah the prophet came near and said lord god of abraham isaac and of israel let it be known this day that thou art god in israel and that i am thy servant and that i have done all
