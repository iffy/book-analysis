tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth when the ear heard me then it blessed me and when the eye saw me it gave witness to me because i delivered the poor that cried and the fatherless and him that had none to help him the blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me and i caused the widows heart to sing for joy i put on righteousness and it clothed me my judgment was as a robe and a diadem i was eyes to the blind and feet was i to the lame i was a father to the poor and the cause which i knew not i searched out and i brake the jaws of the wicked and plucked the spoil out of his teeth then i said i shall die in my nest and i shall multiply my days as the sand my root was spread out by the waters and the dew lay all night upon my branch my glory was fresh in me and my bow was renewed in my hand unto me men gave ear and waited and kept silence at my counsel after my words they spake not again and my speech dropped upon them and they waited for me as for the rain and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain if i laughed on them they believed it not and the light of my countenance they cast not down i chose out their way and sat chief and dwelt as a king in the army as one that comforteth the mourners but now they that are younger than i have me in derision whose fathers i would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock yea whereto might the strength of their hands profit me in whom old age was perished for want and famine they were solitary fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste who cut up mallows by the bushes and juniper roots for their meat they were driven forth from among men they cried after them as after a thief to dwell in the cliffs of the valleys in caves of the earth and in the rocks among the bushes they brayed under the nettles they were gathered together they were children of fools yea children of base men they were viler than the earth and now am i their song yea i am their byword they abhor me they flee far from me and spare not to spit in my face because he hath loosed my cord and afflicted me they have also let loose the bridle before me upon my right hand rise the youth they push away my feet and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction they mar my path they set forward my calamity they have no helper they came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me terrors are turned upon me they pursue my soul as the wind and my welfare passeth away as a cloud and now my soul is poured out upon me the days of affliction have taken hold upon me my bones are pierced in me in the night season and my sinews take no rest by the great force of my disease is my garment changed it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat he hath cast me into the mire and i am become like dust and ashes i cry unto thee and thou dost not hear me i stand up and thou regardest me not thou art become cruel to me with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me thou liftest me up to the wind thou causest me to ride upon it and dissolvest my substance for i know that thou wilt bring me to death and to the house appointed for all living howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave though they cry in his destruction did not i weep for him that was in trouble was not my soul grieved for the poor when i looked for good then evil came unto me and when i waited for light there came darkness my bowels boiled and rested not the days of affliction prevented me i went mourning without the sun i stood up and i cried in the congregation i am a brother to dragons and a companion to owls my skin is black upon me and my bones are burned with heat my harp also is turned to mourning and my organ into the voice of them that weep i made a covenant with mine eyes why then should i think upon a maid for what portion of god is there from above and what inheritance of the almighty from on high is not destruction to the wicked and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity doth not he see my ways and count all my steps if i have walked with vanity or if my foot hath hasted to deceit let me be weighed in an even balance that god may know mine integrity if my step hath turned out of the way and mine heart walked after mine eyes and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands then let me sow and let another eat yea let my offspring be rooted out if mine heart have been deceived by a woman or if i have laid wait at my neighbours door then let my wife grind unto another and let others bow down upon her for this is an heinous crime yea it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges for it is a fire that consumeth to destruction and would root out all mine increase if i did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant when they contended with me what then shall i do when god riseth up and when he visiteth what shall i answer him did not he that made me in the womb make him and did not one fashion us in the womb if i have withheld the poor from their desire or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail or have eaten my morsel myself alone and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof for from my youth
