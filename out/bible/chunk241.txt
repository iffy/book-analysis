the word of the lord thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest he said unto him i am a prophet also as thou art and an angel spake unto me by the word of the lord saying bring him back with thee into thine house that he may eat bread and drink water but he lied unto him so he went back with him and did eat bread in his house and drank water and it came to pass as they sat at the table that the word of the lord came unto the prophet that brought him back and he cried unto the man of god that came from judah saying thus saith the lord forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the lord and hast not kept the commandment which the lord thy god commanded thee but camest back and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place of the which the lord did say to thee eat no bread and drink no water thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers and it came to pass after he had eaten bread and after he had drunk that he saddled for him the ass to wit for the prophet whom he had brought back and when he was gone a lion met him by the way and slew him and his carcase was cast in the way and the ass stood by it the lion also stood by the carcase and behold men passed by and saw the carcase cast in the way and the lion standing by the carcase and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt and when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof he said it is the man of god who was disobedient unto the word of the lord therefore the lord hath delivered him unto the lion which hath torn him and slain him according to the word of the lord which he spake unto him and he spake to his sons saying saddle me the ass and they saddled him and he went and found his carcase cast in the way and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase the lion had not eaten the carcase nor torn the ass and the prophet took up the carcase of the man of god and laid it upon the ass and brought it back and the old prophet came to the city to mourn and to bury him and he laid his carcase in his own grave and they mourned over him saying alas my brother and it came to pass after he had buried him that he spake to his sons saying when i am dead then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of god is buried lay my bones beside his bones for the saying which he cried by the word of the lord against the altar in bethel and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of samaria shall surely come to pass after this thing jeroboam returned not from his evil way but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places whosoever would he consecrated him and he became one of the priests of the high places and this thing became sin unto the house of jeroboam even to cut it off and to destroy it from off the face of the earth at that time abijah the son of jeroboam fell sick and jeroboam said to his wife arise i pray thee and disguise thyself that thou be not known to be the wife of jeroboam and get thee to shiloh behold there is ahijah the prophet which told me that i should be king over this people and take with thee ten loaves and cracknels and a cruse of honey and go to him he shall tell thee what shall become of the child and jeroboams wife did so and arose and went to shiloh and came to the house of ahijah but ahijah could not see for his eyes were set by reason of his age and the lord said unto ahijah behold the wife of jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son for he is sick thus and thus shalt thou say unto her for it shall be when she cometh in that she shall feign herself to be another woman and it was so when ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came in at the door that he said come in thou wife of jeroboam why feignest thou thyself to be another for i am sent to thee with heavy tidings go tell jeroboam thus saith the lord god of israel forasmuch as i exalted thee from among the people and made thee prince over my people israel and rent the kingdom away from the house of david and gave it thee and yet thou hast not been as my servant david who kept my commandments and who followed me with all his heart to do that only which was right in mine eyes but hast done evil above all that were before thee for thou hast gone and made thee other gods and molten images to provoke me to anger and hast cast me behind thy back therefore behold i will bring evil upon the house of jeroboam and will cut off from jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall and him that is shut up and left in israel and will take away the remnant of the house of jeroboam as a man taketh away dung till it be all gone him that dieth of jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat for the lord hath spoken it arise thou therefore get thee to thine own house and when thy feet enter into the city the child shall die and all israel shall mourn for him and bury him for he only of jeroboam shall come to the grave because in him there is found some good thing toward the lord god of israel in the house of jeroboam moreover the lord shall raise him
