of israel his servant ye children of jacob his chosen ones he is the lord our god his judgments are in all the earth be ye mindful always of his covenant the word which he commanded to a thousand generations even of the covenant which he made with abraham and of his oath unto isaac and hath confirmed the same to jacob for a law and to israel for an everlasting covenant saying unto thee will i give the land of canaan the lot of your inheritance when ye were but few even a few and strangers in it and when they went from nation to nation and from one kingdom to another people he suffered no man to do them wrong yea he reproved kings for their sakes saying touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm sing unto the lord all the earth shew forth from day to day his salvation declare his glory among the heathen his marvellous works among all nations for great is the lord and greatly to be praised he also is to be feared above all gods for all the gods of the people are idols but the lord made the heavens glory and honour are in his presence strength and gladness are in his place give unto the lord ye kindreds of the people give unto the lord glory and strength give unto the lord the glory due unto his name bring an offering and come before him worship the lord in the beauty of holiness fear before him all the earth the world also shall be stable that it be not moved let the heavens be glad and let the earth rejoice and let men say among the nations the lord reigneth let the sea roar and the fulness thereof let the fields rejoice and all that is therein then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the lord because he cometh to judge the earth o give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever and say ye save us o god of our salvation and gather us together and deliver us from the heathen that we may give thanks to thy holy name and glory in thy praise blessed be the lord god of israel for ever and ever and all the people said amen and praised the lord so he left there before the ark of the covenant of the lord asaph and his brethren to minister before the ark continually as every days work required and obededom with their brethren threescore and eight obededom also the son of jeduthun and hosah to be porters and zadok the priest and his brethren the priests before the tabernacle of the lord in the high place that was at gibeon to offer burnt offerings unto the lord upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening and to do according to all that is written in the law of the lord which he commanded israel and with them heman and jeduthun and the rest that were chosen who were expressed by name to give thanks to the lord because his mercy endureth for ever and with them heman and jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound and with musical instruments of god and the sons of jeduthun were porters and all the people departed every man to his house and david returned to bless his house now it came to pass as david sat in his house that david said to nathan the prophet lo i dwell in an house of cedars but the ark of the covenant of the lord remaineth under curtains then nathan said unto david do all that is in thine heart for god is with thee and it came to pass the same night that the word of god came to nathan saying go and tell david my servant thus saith the lord thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in for i have not dwelt in an house since the day that i brought up israel unto this day but have gone from tent to tent and from one tabernacle to another wheresoever i have walked with all israel spake i a word to any of the judges of israel whom i commanded to feed my people saying why have ye not built me an house of cedars now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant david thus saith the lord of hosts i took thee from the sheepcote even from following the sheep that thou shouldest be ruler over my people israel and i have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth also i will ordain a place for my people israel and will plant them and they shall dwell in their place and shall be moved no more neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more as at the beginning and since the time that i commanded judges to be over my people israel moreover i will subdue all thine enemies furthermore i tell thee that the lord will build thee an house and it shall come to pass when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers that i will raise up thy seed after thee which shall be of thy sons and i will establish his kingdom he shall build me an house and i will stablish his throne for ever i will be his father and he shall be my son and i will not take my mercy away from him as i took it from him that was before thee but i will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever and his throne shall be established for evermore according to all these words and according to all this vision so did nathan speak unto david and david the king came and sat before the lord and said who am i o lord god and what is mine house that thou hast brought me hitherto and yet this was a small thing in thine eyes o god for thou hast also spoken of thy servants
