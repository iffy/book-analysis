bread unto thy men that are weary and he took the elders of the city and thorns of the wilderness and briers and with them he taught the men of succoth and he beat down the tower of penuel and slew the men of the city then said he unto zebah and zalmunna what manner of men were they whom ye slew at tabor and they answered as thou art so were they each one resembled the children of a king and he said they were my brethren even the sons of my mother as the lord liveth if ye had saved them alive i would not slay you and he said unto jether his firstborn up and slay them but the youth drew not his sword for he feared because he was yet a youth then zebah and zalmunna said rise thou and fall upon us for as the man is so is his strength and gideon arose and slew zebah and zalmunna and took away the ornaments that were on their camels necks then the men of israel said unto gideon rule thou over us both thou and thy son and thy sons son also for thou hast delivered us from the hand of midian and gideon said unto them i will not rule over you neither shall my son rule over you the lord shall rule over you and gideon said unto them i would desire a request of you that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey for they had golden earrings because they were ishmaelites and they answered we will willingly give them and they spread a garment and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey and the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold beside ornaments and collars and purple raiment that was on the kings of midian and beside the chains that were about their camels necks and gideon made an ephod thereof and put it in his city even in ophrah and all israel went thither a whoring after it which thing became a snare unto gideon and to his house thus was midian subdued before the children of israel so that they lifted up their heads no more and the country was in quietness forty years in the days of gideon and jerubbaal the son of joash went and dwelt in his own house and gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten for he had many wives and his concubine that was in shechem she also bare him a son whose name he called abimelech and gideon the son of joash died in a good old age and was buried in the sepulchre of joash his father in ophrah of the abiezrites and it came to pass as soon as gideon was dead that the children of israel turned again and went a whoring after baalim and made baalberith their god and the children of israel remembered not the lord their god who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side neither shewed they kindness to the house of jerubbaal namely gideon according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto israel and abimelech the son of jerubbaal went to shechem unto his mothers brethren and communed with them and with all the family of the house of his mothers father saying speak i pray you in the ears of all the men of shechem whether is better for you either that all the sons of jerubbaal which are threescore and ten persons reign over you or that one reign over you remember also that i am your bone and your flesh and his mothers brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of shechem all these words and their hearts inclined to follow abimelech for they said he is our brother and they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of baalberith wherewith abimelech hired vain and light persons which followed him and he went unto his fathers house at ophrah and slew his brethren the sons of jerubbaal being threescore and ten persons upon one stone notwithstanding yet jotham the youngest son of jerubbaal was left for he hid himself and all the men of shechem gathered together and all the house of millo and went and made abimelech king by the plain of the pillar that was in shechem and when they told it to jotham he went and stood in the top of mount gerizim and lifted up his voice and cried and said unto them hearken unto me ye men of shechem that god may hearken unto you the trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them and they said unto the olive tree reign thou over us but the olive tree said unto them should i leave my fatness wherewith by me they honour god and man and go to be promoted over the trees and the trees said to the fig tree come thou and reign over us but the fig tree said unto them should i forsake my sweetness and my good fruit and go to be promoted over the trees then said the trees unto the vine come thou and reign over us and the vine said unto them should i leave my wine which cheereth god and man and go to be promoted over the trees then said all the trees unto the bramble come thou and reign over us and the bramble said unto the trees if in truth ye anoint me king over you then come and put your trust in my shadow and if not let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of lebanon now therefore if ye have done truly and sincerely in that ye have made abimelech king and if ye have dealt well with jerubbaal and his house and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands for my father fought for you and adventured his life far and delivered you out of the hand of midian and ye are risen up against my fathers house this day and have slain his sons threescore and ten persons upon one stone and have made abimelech the son of
