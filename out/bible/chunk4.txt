male and his female of fowls also of the air by sevens the male and the female to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth for yet seven days and i will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights and every living substance that i have made will i destroy from off the face of the earth and noah did according unto all that the lord commanded him and noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth and noah went in and his sons and his wife and his sons wives with him into the ark because of the waters of the flood of clean beasts and of beasts that are not clean and of fowls and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth there went in two and two unto noah into the ark the male and the female as god had commanded noah and it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were upon the earth in the six hundredth year of noahs life in the second month the seventeenth day of the month the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were opened and the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights in the selfsame day entered noah and shem and ham and japheth the sons of noah and noahs wife and the three wives of his sons with them into the ark they and every beast after his kind and all the cattle after their kind and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind and every fowl after his kind every bird of every sort and they went in unto noah into the ark two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life and they that went in went in male and female of all flesh as god had commanded him and the lord shut him in and the flood was forty days upon the earth and the waters increased and bare up the ark and it was lift up above the earth and the waters prevailed and were increased greatly upon the earth and the ark went upon the face of the waters and the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth and all the high hills that were under the whole heaven were covered fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail and the mountains were covered and all flesh died that moved upon the earth both of fowl and of cattle and of beast and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth and every man all in whose nostrils was the breath of life of all that was in the dry land died and every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground both man and cattle and the creeping things and the fowl of the heaven and they were destroyed from the earth and noah only remained alive and they that were with him in the ark and the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days and god remembered noah and every living thing and all the cattle that was with him in the ark and god made a wind to pass over the earth and the waters asswaged the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped and the rain from heaven was restrained and the waters returned from off the earth continually and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated and the ark rested in the seventh month on the seventeenth day of the month upon the mountains of ararat and the waters decreased continually until the tenth month in the tenth month on the first day of the month were the tops of the mountains seen and it came to pass at the end of forty days that noah opened the window of the ark which he had made and he sent forth a raven which went forth to and fro until the waters were dried up from off the earth also he sent forth a dove from him to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot and she returned unto him into the ark for the waters were on the face of the whole earth then he put forth his hand and took her and pulled her in unto him into the ark and he stayed yet other seven days and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark and the dove came in to him in the evening and lo in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off so noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth and he stayed yet other seven days and sent forth the dove which returned not again unto him any more and it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year in the first month the first day of the month the waters were dried up from off the earth and noah removed the covering of the ark and looked and behold the face of the ground was dry and in the second month on the seven and twentieth day of the month was the earth dried and god spake unto noah saying go forth of the ark thou and thy wife and thy sons and thy sons wives with thee bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh both of fowl and of cattle and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth that they may breed abundantly in the earth and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth and noah went forth and his sons and his wife and his sons wives with him every beast every creeping thing and every fowl and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth after their kinds went forth out of the ark and noah builded an altar unto the lord and took of every clean beast and of every clean fowl and offered burnt offerings on the altar and the lord smelled a sweet savour and the lord said in his heart i will not again curse the ground any more for
