the people and their voice was heard and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place even unto heaven now when all this was finished all israel that were present went out to the cities of judah and brake the images in pieces and cut down the groves and threw down the high places and the altars out of all judah and benjamin in ephraim also and manasseh until they had utterly destroyed them all then all the children of israel returned every man to his possession into their own cities and hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the levites after their courses every man according to his service the priests and levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings to minister and to give thanks and to praise in the gates of the tents of the lord he appointed also the kings portion of his substance for the burnt offerings to wit for the morning and evening burnt offerings and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths and for the new moons and for the set feasts as it is written in the law of the lord moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the levites that they might be encouraged in the law of the lord and as soon as the commandment came abroad the children of israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn wine and oil and honey and of all the increase of the field and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly and concerning the children of israel and judah that dwelt in the cities of judah they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the lord their god and laid them by heaps in the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps and finished them in the seventh month and when hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps they blessed the lord and his people israel then hezekiah questioned with the priests and the levites concerning the heaps and azariah the chief priest of the house of zadok answered him and said since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the lord we have had enough to eat and have left plenty for the lord hath blessed his people and that which is left is this great store then hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the lord and they prepared them and brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully over which cononiah the levite was ruler and shimei his brother was the next and jehiel and azaziah and nahath and asahel and jerimoth and jozabad and eliel and ismachiah and mahath and benaiah were overseers under the hand of cononiah and shimei his brother at the commandment of hezekiah the king and azariah the ruler of the house of god and kore the son of imnah the levite the porter toward the east was over the freewill offerings of god to distribute the oblations of the lord and the most holy things and next him were eden and miniamin and jeshua and shemaiah amariah and shecaniah in the cities of the priests in their set office to give to their brethren by courses as well to the great as to the small beside their genealogy of males from three years old and upward even unto every one that entereth into the house of the lord his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their courses both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers and the levites from twenty years old and upward in their charges by their courses and to the genealogy of all their little ones their wives and their sons and their daughters through all the congregation for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness also of the sons of aaron the priests which were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities in every several city the men that were expressed by name to give portions to all the males among the priests and to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the levites and thus did hezekiah throughout all judah and wrought that which was good and right and truth before the lord his god and in every work that he began in the service of the house of god and in the law and in the commandments to seek his god he did it with all his heart and prospered after these things and the establishment thereof sennacherib king of assyria came and entered into judah and encamped against the fenced cities and thought to win them for himself and when hezekiah saw that sennacherib was come and that he was purposed to fight against jerusalem he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city and they did help him so there was gathered much people together who stopped all the fountains and the brook that ran through the midst of the land saying why should the kings of assyria come and find much water also he strengthened himself and built up all the wall that was broken and raised it up to the towers and another wall without and repaired millo in the city of david and made darts and shields in abundance and he set captains of war over the people and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city and spake comfortably to them saying be
