in heart he layeth his wait shall i not visit them for these things saith the lord shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this for the mountains will i take up a weeping and wailing and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation because they are burned up so that none can pass through them neither can men hear the voice of the cattle both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled they are gone and i will make jerusalem heaps and a den of dragons and i will make the cities of judah desolate without an inhabitant who is the wise man that may understand this and who is he to whom the mouth of the lord hath spoken that he may declare it for what the land perisheth and is burned up like a wilderness that none passeth through and the lord saith because they have forsaken my law which i set before them and have not obeyed my voice neither walked therein but have walked after the imagination of their own heart and after baalim which their fathers taught them therefore thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will feed them even this people with wormwood and give them water of gall to drink i will scatter them also among the heathen whom neither they nor their fathers have known and i will send a sword after them till i have consumed them thus saith the lord of hosts consider ye and call for the mourning women that they may come and send for cunning women that they may come and let them make haste and take up a wailing for us that our eyes may run down with tears and our eyelids gush out with waters for a voice of wailing is heard out of zion how are we spoiled we are greatly confounded because we have forsaken the land because our dwellings have cast us out yet hear the word of the lord o ye women and let your ear receive the word of his mouth and teach your daughters wailing and every one her neighbour lamentation for death is come up into our windows and is entered into our palaces to cut off the children from without and the young men from the streets speak thus saith the lord even the carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open field and as the handful after the harvestman and none shall gather them thus saith the lord let not the wise man glory in his wisdom neither let the mighty man glory in his might let not the rich man glory in his riches but let him that glorieth glory in this that he understandeth and knoweth me that i am the lord which exercise lovingkindness judgment and righteousness in the earth for in these things i delight saith the lord behold the days come saith the lord that i will punish all them which are circumcised with the uncircumcised egypt and judah and edom and the children of ammon and moab and all that are in the utmost corners that dwell in the wilderness for all these nations are uncircumcised and all the house of israel are uncircumcised in the heart hear ye the word which the lord speaketh unto you o house of israel thus saith the lord learn not the way of the heathen and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven for the heathen are dismayed at them for the customs of the people are vain for one cutteth a tree out of the forest the work of the hands of the workman with the axe they deck it with silver and with gold they fasten it with nails and with hammers that it move not they are upright as the palm tree but speak not they must needs be borne because they cannot go be not afraid of them for they cannot do evil neither also is it in them to do good forasmuch as there is none like unto thee o lord thou art great and thy name is great in might who would not fear thee o king of nations for to thee doth it appertain forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms there is none like unto thee but they are altogether brutish and foolish the stock is a doctrine of vanities silver spread into plates is brought from tarshish and gold from uphaz the work of the workman and of the hands of the founder blue and purple is their clothing they are all the work of cunning men but the lord is the true god he is the living god and an everlasting king at his wrath the earth shall tremble and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation thus shall ye say unto them the gods that have not made the heavens and the earth even they shall perish from the earth and from under these heavens he hath made the earth by his power he hath established the world by his wisdom and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion when he uttereth his voice there is a multitude of waters in the heavens and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth he maketh lightnings with rain and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures every man is brutish in his knowledge every founder is confounded by the graven image for his molten image is falsehood and there is no breath in them they are vanity and the work of errors in the time of their visitation they shall perish the portion of jacob is not like them for he is the former of all things and israel is the rod of his inheritance the lord of hosts is his name gather up thy wares out of the land o inhabitant of the fortress for thus saith the lord behold i will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once and will distress them that they may find it so woe is me for my hurt my wound is grievous but i said truly this is a grief and i must bear it my tabernacle is spoiled and all my cords are broken my
