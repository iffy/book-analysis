thus saith the lord even so will i break the yoke of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years and the prophet jeremiah went his way then the word of the lord came unto jeremiah the prophet after that hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet jeremiah saying go and tell hananiah saying thus saith the lord thou hast broken the yokes of wood but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel i have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations that they may serve nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and they shall serve him and i have given him the beasts of the field also then said the prophet jeremiah unto hananiah the prophet hear now hananiah the lord hath not sent thee but thou makest this people to trust in a lie therefore thus saith the lord behold i will cast thee from off the face of the earth this year thou shalt die because thou hast taught rebellion against the lord so hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month now these are the words of the letter that jeremiah the prophet sent from jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried away captives and to the priests and to the prophets and to all the people whom nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from jerusalem to babylon after that jeconiah the king and the queen and the eunuchs the princes of judah and jerusalem and the carpenters and the smiths were departed from jerusalem by the hand of elasah the son of shaphan and gemariah the son of hilkiah whom zedekiah king of judah sent unto babylon to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon saying thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel unto all that are carried away captives whom i have caused to be carried away from jerusalem unto babylon build ye houses and dwell in them and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them take ye wives and beget sons and daughters and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands that they may bear sons and daughters that ye may be increased there and not diminished and seek the peace of the city whither i have caused you to be carried away captives and pray unto the lord for it for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel let not your prophets and your diviners that be in the midst of you deceive you neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed for they prophesy falsely unto you in my name i have not sent them saith the lord for thus saith the lord that after seventy years be accomplished at babylon i will visit you and perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this place for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end then shall ye call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart and i will be found of you saith the lord and i will turn away your captivity and i will gather you from all the nations and from all the places whither i have driven you saith the lord and i will bring you again into the place whence i caused you to be carried away captive because ye have said the lord hath raised us up prophets in babylon know that thus saith the lord of the king that sitteth upon the throne of david and of all the people that dwelleth in this city and of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity thus saith the lord of hosts behold i will send upon them the sword the famine and the pestilence and will make them like vile figs that cannot be eaten they are so evil and i will persecute them with the sword with the famine and with the pestilence and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth to be a curse and an astonishment and an hissing and a reproach among all the nations whither i have driven them because they have not hearkened to my words saith the lord which i sent unto them by my servants the prophets rising up early and sending them but ye would not hear saith the lord hear ye therefore the word of the lord all ye of the captivity whom i have sent from jerusalem to babylon thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel of ahab the son of kolaiah and of zedekiah the son of maaseiah which prophesy a lie unto you in my name behold i will deliver them into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and he shall slay them before your eyes and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of judah which are in babylon saying the lord make thee like zedekiah and like ahab whom the king of babylon roasted in the fire because they have committed villany in israel and have committed adultery with their neighbours wives and have spoken lying words in my name which i have not commanded them even i know and am a witness saith the lord thus shalt thou also speak to shemaiah the nehelamite saying thus speaketh the lord of hosts the god of israel saying because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that are at jerusalem and to zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest and to all the priests saying the lord hath made thee priest in the stead of jehoiada the priest that ye should be officers in the house of the lord for every man that is mad and maketh himself a prophet that thou shouldest put him in prison and in the stocks now therefore why hast thou not reproved jeremiah of anathoth which
