house unto the name of the lord his god for the wars which were about him on every side until the lord put them under the soles of his feet but now the lord my god hath given me rest on every side so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent and behold i purpose to build an house unto the name of the lord my god as the lord spake unto david my father saying thy son whom i will set upon thy throne in thy room he shall build an house unto my name now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of lebanon and my servants shall be with thy servants and unto thee will i give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the sidonians and it came to pass when hiram heard the words of solomon that he rejoiced greatly and said blessed be the lord this day which hath given unto david a wise son over this great people and hiram sent to solomon saying i have considered the things which thou sentest to me for and i will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar and concerning timber of fir my servants shall bring them down from lebanon unto the sea and i will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me and will cause them to be discharged there and thou shalt receive them and thou shalt accomplish my desire in giving food for my household so hiram gave solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire and solomon gave hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household and twenty measures of pure oil thus gave solomon to hiram year by year and the lord gave solomon wisdom as he promised him and there was peace between hiram and solomon and they two made a league together and king solomon raised a levy out of all israel and the levy was thirty thousand men and he sent them to lebanon ten thousand a month by courses a month they were in lebanon and two months at home and adoniram was over the levy and solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains beside the chief of solomons officers which were over the work three thousand and three hundred which ruled over the people that wrought in the work and the king commanded and they brought great stones costly stones and hewed stones to lay the foundation of the house and solomons builders and hirams builders did hew them and the stonesquarers so they prepared timber and stones to build the house and it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of israel were come out of the land of egypt in the fourth year of solomons reign over israel in the month zif which is the second month that he began to build the house of the lord and the house which king solomon built for the lord the length thereof was threescore cubits and the breadth thereof twenty cubits and the height thereof thirty cubits and the porch before the temple of the house twenty cubits was the length thereof according to the breadth of the house and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house and for the house he made windows of narrow lights and against the wall of the house he built chambers round about against the walls of the house round about both of the temple and of the oracle and he made chambers round about the nethermost chamber was five cubits broad and the middle was six cubits broad and the third was seven cubits broad for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house and the house when it was in building was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house while it was in building the door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber and out of the middle into the third so he built the house and finished it and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar and then he built chambers against all the house five cubits high and they rested on the house with timber of cedar and the word of the lord came to solomon saying concerning this house which thou art in building if thou wilt walk in my statutes and execute my judgments and keep all my commandments to walk in them then will i perform my word with thee which i spake unto david thy father and i will dwell among the children of israel and will not forsake my people israel so solomon built the house and finished it and he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar both the floor of the house and the walls of the ceiling and he covered them on the inside with wood and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir and he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar he even built them for it within even for the oracle even for the most holy place and the house that is the temple before it was forty cubits long and the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers all was cedar there was no stone seen and the oracle he prepared in the house within to set there the ark of the covenant of the lord and the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length and twenty cubits in breadth and twenty cubits in the height thereof and he overlaid it with pure gold and so covered the altar which was of cedar so solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold and he made a partition by the chains of gold
