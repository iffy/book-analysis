and some of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the spices and mattithiah one of the levites who was the firstborn of shallum the korahite had the set office over the things that were made in the pans and other of their brethren of the sons of the kohathites were over the shewbread to prepare it every sabbath and these are the singers chief of the fathers of the levites who remaining in the chambers were free for they were employed in that work day and night these chief fathers of the levites were chief throughout their generations these dwelt at jerusalem and in gibeon dwelt the father of gibeon jehiel whose wifes name was maachah and his firstborn son abdon then zur and kish and baal and ner and nadab and gedor and ahio and zechariah and mikloth and mikloth begat shimeam and they also dwelt with their brethren at jerusalem over against their brethren and ner begat kish and kish begat saul and saul begat jonathan and malchishua and abinadab and eshbaal and the son of jonathan was meribbaal and meribbaal begat micah and the sons of micah were pithon and melech and tahrea and ahaz and ahaz begat jarah and jarah begat alemeth and azmaveth and zimri and zimri begat moza and moza begat binea and rephaiah his son eleasah his son azel his son and azel had six sons whose names are these azrikam bocheru and ishmael and sheariah and obadiah and hanan these were the sons of azel now the philistines fought against israel and the men of israel fled from before the philistines and fell down slain in mount gilboa and the philistines followed hard after saul and after his sons and the philistines slew jonathan and abinadab and malchishua the sons of saul and the battle went sore against saul and the archers hit him and he was wounded of the archers then said saul to his armourbearer draw thy sword and thrust me through therewith lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me but his armourbearer would not for he was sore afraid so saul took a sword and fell upon it and when his armourbearer saw that saul was dead he fell likewise on the sword and died so saul died and his three sons and all his house died together and when all the men of israel that were in the valley saw that they fled and that saul and his sons were dead then they forsook their cities and fled and the philistines came and dwelt in them and it came to pass on the morrow when the philistines came to strip the slain that they found saul and his sons fallen in mount gilboa and when they had stripped him they took his head and his armour and sent into the land of the philistines round about to carry tidings unto their idols and to the people and they put his armour in the house of their gods and fastened his head in the temple of dagon and when all jabeshgilead heard all that the philistines had done to saul they arose all the valiant men and took away the body of saul and the bodies of his sons and brought them to jabesh and buried their bones under the oak in jabesh and fasted seven days so saul died for his transgression which he committed against the lord even against the word of the lord which he kept not and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit to enquire of it and enquired not of the lord therefore he slew him and turned the kingdom unto david the son of jesse then all israel gathered themselves to david unto hebron saying behold we are thy bone and thy flesh and moreover in time past even when saul was king thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in israel and the lord thy god said unto thee thou shalt feed my people israel and thou shalt be ruler over my people israel therefore came all the elders of israel to the king to hebron and david made a covenant with them in hebron before the lord and they anointed david king over israel according to the word of the lord by samuel and david and all israel went to jerusalem which is jebus where the jebusites were the inhabitants of the land and the inhabitants of jebus said to david thou shalt not come hither nevertheless david took the castle of zion which is the city of david and david said whosoever smiteth the jebusites first shall be chief and captain so joab the son of zeruiah went first up and was chief and david dwelt in the castle therefore they called it the city of david and he built the city round about even from millo round about and joab repaired the rest of the city so david waxed greater and greater for the lord of hosts was with him these also are the chief of the mighty men whom david had who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom and with all israel to make him king according to the word of the lord concerning israel and this is the number of the mighty men whom david had jashobeam an hachmonite the chief of the captains he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time and after him was eleazar the son of dodo the ahohite who was one of the three mighties he was with david at pasdammim and there the philistines were gathered together to battle where was a parcel of ground full of barley and the people fled from before the philistines and they set themselves in the midst of that parcel and delivered it and slew the philistines and the lord saved them by a great deliverance now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to david into the cave of adullam and the host of the philistines encamped in the valley of rephaim and david was then in the hold and the philistines garrison was then at bethlehem and david longed and said oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of bethlehem that is at the gate and the three brake through the host of the philistines and
