and the lord said who shall entice ahab king of israel that he may go up and fall at ramothgilead and one spake saying after this manner and another saying after that manner then there came out a spirit and stood before the lord and said i will entice him and the lord said unto him wherewith and he said i will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets and the lord said thou shalt entice him and thou shalt also prevail go out and do even so now therefore behold the lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets and the lord hath spoken evil against thee then zedekiah the son of chenaanah came near and smote micaiah upon the cheek and said which way went the spirit of the lord from me to speak unto thee and micaiah said behold thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself then the king of israel said take ye micaiah and carry him back to amon the governor of the city and to joash the kings son and say thus saith the king put this fellow in the prison and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until i return in peace and micaiah said if thou certainly return in peace then hath not the lord spoken by me and he said hearken all ye people so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up to ramothgilead and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat i will disguise myself and i will go to the battle but put thou on thy robes so the king of israel disguised himself and they went to the battle now the king of syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him saying fight ye not with small or great save only with the king of israel and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw jehoshaphat that they said it is the king of israel therefore they compassed about him to fight but jehoshaphat cried out and the lord helped him and god moved them to depart from him for it came to pass that when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of israel they turned back again from pursuing him and a certain man drew a bow at a venture and smote the king of israel between the joints of the harness therefore he said to his chariot man turn thine hand that thou mayest carry me out of the host for i am wounded and the battle increased that day howbeit the king of israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the syrians until the even and about the time of the sun going down he died and jehoshaphat the king of judah returned to his house in peace to jerusalem and jehu the son of hanani the seer went out to meet him and said to king jehoshaphat shouldest thou help the ungodly and love them that hate the lord therefore is wrath upon thee from before the lord nevertheless there are good things found in thee in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land and hast prepared thine heart to seek god and jehoshaphat dwelt at jerusalem and he went out again through the people from beersheba to mount ephraim and brought them back unto the lord god of their fathers and he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of judah city by city and said to the judges take heed what ye do for ye judge not for man but for the lord who is with you in the judgment wherefore now let the fear of the lord be upon you take heed and do it for there is no iniquity with the lord our god nor respect of persons nor taking of gifts moreover in jerusalem did jehoshaphat set of the levites and of the priests and of the chief of the fathers of israel for the judgment of the lord and for controversies when they returned to jerusalem and he charged them saying thus shall ye do in the fear of the lord faithfully and with a perfect heart and what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that dwell in your cities between blood and blood between law and commandment statutes and judgments ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against the lord and so wrath come upon you and upon your brethren this do and ye shall not trespass and behold amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the lord and zebadiah the son of ishmael the ruler of the house of judah for all the kings matters also the levites shall be officers before you deal courageously and the lord shall be with the good it came to pass after this also that the children of moab and the children of ammon and with them other beside the ammonites came against jehoshaphat to battle then there came some that told jehoshaphat saying there cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side syria and behold they be in hazazontamar which is engedi and jehoshaphat feared and set himself to seek the lord and proclaimed a fast throughout all judah and judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the lord even out of all the cities of judah they came to seek the lord and jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of judah and jerusalem in the house of the lord before the new court and said o lord god of our fathers art not thou god in heaven and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen and in thine hand is there not power and might so that none is able to withstand thee art not thou our god who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people israel and gavest it to the seed of abraham thy friend for ever and they dwelt therein and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name saying if when evil cometh upon us as the sword judgment or pestilence or famine we stand before this
