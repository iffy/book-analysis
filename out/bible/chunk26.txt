to be comforted and he said for i will go down into the grave unto my son mourning thus his father wept for him and the midianites sold him into egypt unto potiphar an officer of pharaohs and captain of the guard and it came to pass at that time that judah went down from his brethren and turned in to a certain adullamite whose name was hirah and judah saw there a daughter of a certain canaanite whose name was shuah and he took her and went in unto her and she conceived and bare a son and he called his name er and she conceived again and bare a son and she called his name onan and she yet again conceived and bare a son and called his name shelah and he was at chezib when she bare him and judah took a wife for er his firstborn whose name was tamar and er judahs firstborn was wicked in the sight of the lord and the lord slew him and judah said unto onan go in unto thy brothers wife and marry her and raise up seed to thy brother and onan knew that the seed should not be his and it came to pass when he went in unto his brothers wife that he spilled it on the ground lest that he should give seed to his brother and the thing which he did displeased the lord wherefore he slew him also then said judah to tamar his daughter in law remain a widow at thy fathers house till shelah my son be grown for he said lest peradventure he die also as his brethren did and tamar went and dwelt in her fathers house and in process of time the daughter of shuah judahs wife died and judah was comforted and went up unto his sheepshearers to timnath he and his friend hirah the adullamite and it was told tamar saying behold thy father in law goeth up to timnath to shear his sheep and she put her widows garments off from her and covered her with a vail and wrapped herself and sat in an open place which is by the way to timnath for she saw that shelah was grown and she was not given unto him to wife when judah saw her he thought her to be an harlot because she had covered her face and he turned unto her by the way and said go to i pray thee let me come in unto thee for he knew not that she was his daughter in law and she said what wilt thou give me that thou mayest come in unto me and he said i will send thee a kid from the flock and she said wilt thou give me a pledge till thou send it and he said what pledge shall i give thee and she said thy signet and thy bracelets and thy staff that is in thine hand and he gave it her and came in unto her and she conceived by him and she arose and went away and laid by her vail from her and put on the garments of her widowhood and judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the adullamite to receive his pledge from the womans hand but he found her not then he asked the men of that place saying where is the harlot that was openly by the way side and they said there was no harlot in this place and he returned to judah and said i cannot find her and also the men of the place said that there was no harlot in this place and judah said let her take it to her lest we be shamed behold i sent this kid and thou hast not found her and it came to pass about three months after that it was told judah saying tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot and also behold she is with child by whoredom and judah said bring her forth and let her be burnt when she was brought forth she sent to her father in law saying by the man whose these are am i with child and she said discern i pray thee whose are these the signet and bracelets and staff and judah acknowledged them and said she hath been more righteous than i because that i gave her not to shelah my son and he knew her again no more and it came to pass in the time of her travail that behold twins were in her womb and it came to pass when she travailed that the one put out his hand and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread saying this came out first and it came to pass as he drew back his hand that behold his brother came out and she said how hast thou broken forth this breach be upon thee therefore his name was called pharez and afterward came out his brother that had the scarlet thread upon his hand and his name was called zarah and joseph was brought down to egypt and potiphar an officer of pharaoh captain of the guard an egyptian bought him of the hands of the ishmeelites which had brought him down thither and the lord was with joseph and he was a prosperous man and he was in the house of his master the egyptian and his master saw that the lord was with him and that the lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand and joseph found grace in his sight and he served him and he made him overseer over his house and all that he had he put into his hand and it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house and over all that he had that the lord blessed the egyptians house for josephs sake and the blessing of the lord was upon all that he had in the house and in the field and he left all that he had in josephs hand and he knew not ought he had save the bread which he did eat and joseph was a goodly person and well favoured and it came to pass after these things that his masters wife cast her
