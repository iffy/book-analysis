judgments and do them that the land whither i bring you to dwell therein spue you not out and ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation which i cast out before you for they committed all these things and therefore i abhorred them but i have said unto you ye shall inherit their land and i will give it unto you to possess it a land that floweth with milk and honey i am the lord your god which have separated you from other people ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean and between unclean fowls and clean and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast or by fowl or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground which i have separated from you as unclean and ye shall be holy unto me for i the lord am holy and have severed you from other people that ye should be mine a man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit or that is a wizard shall surely be put to death they shall stone them with stones their blood shall be upon them and the lord said unto moses speak unto the priests the sons of aaron and say unto them there shall none be defiled for the dead among his people but for his kin that is near unto him that is for his mother and for his father and for his son and for his daughter and for his brother and for his sister a virgin that is nigh unto him which hath had no husband for her may he be defiled but he shall not defile himself being a chief man among his people to profane himself they shall not make baldness upon their head neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard nor make any cuttings in their flesh they shall be holy unto their god and not profane the name of their god for the offerings of the lord made by fire and the bread of their god they do offer therefore they shall be holy they shall not take a wife that is a whore or profane neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband for he is holy unto his god thou shalt sanctify him therefore for he offereth the bread of thy god he shall be holy unto thee for i the lord which sanctify you am holy and the daughter of any priest if she profane herself by playing the whore she profaneth her father she shall be burnt with fire and he that is the high priest among his brethren upon whose head the anointing oil was poured and that is consecrated to put on the garments shall not uncover his head nor rend his clothes neither shall he go in to any dead body nor defile himself for his father or for his mother neither shall he go out of the sanctuary nor profane the sanctuary of his god for the crown of the anointing oil of his god is upon him i am the lord and he shall take a wife in her virginity a widow or a divorced woman or profane or an harlot these shall he not take but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife neither shall he profane his seed among his people for i the lord do sanctify him and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto aaron saying whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any blemish let him not approach to offer the bread of his god for whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish he shall not approach a blind man or a lame or he that hath a flat nose or any thing superfluous or a man that is brokenfooted or brokenhanded or crookbackt or a dwarf or that hath a blemish in his eye or be scurvy or scabbed or hath his stones broken no man that hath a blemish of the seed of aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the lord made by fire he hath a blemish he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his god he shall eat the bread of his god both of the most holy and of the holy only he shall not go in unto the vail nor come nigh unto the altar because he hath a blemish that he profane not my sanctuaries for i the lord do sanctify them and moses told it unto aaron and to his sons and unto all the children of israel and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto aaron and to his sons that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of israel and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow unto me i am the lord say unto them whosoever he be of all your seed among your generations that goeth unto the holy things which the children of israel hallow unto the lord having his uncleanness upon him that soul shall be cut off from my presence i am the lord what man soever of the seed of aaron is a leper or hath a running issue he shall not eat of the holy things until he be clean and whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead or a man whose seed goeth from him or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing whereby he may be made unclean or a man of whom he may take uncleanness whatsoever uncleanness he hath the soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even and shall not eat of the holy things unless he wash his flesh with water and when the sun is down he shall be clean and shall afterward eat of the holy things because it is his food that which dieth of itself or is torn with beasts he shall not eat to defile himself therewith i am the lord they shall therefore keep mine ordinance lest they bear sin for it and die therefore if they profane it i the lord do sanctify them there shall no stranger eat of the holy thing a sojourner of the priest or an hired servant shall not eat of the holy
