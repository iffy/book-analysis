on the horns of the altar saying let king solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword and solomon said if he will shew himself a worthy man there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth but if wickedness shall be found in him he shall die so king solomon sent and they brought him down from the altar and he came and bowed himself to king solomon and solomon said unto him go to thine house now the days of david drew nigh that he should die and he charged solomon his son saying i go the way of all the earth be thou strong therefore and shew thyself a man and keep the charge of the lord thy god to walk in his ways to keep his statutes and his commandments and his judgments and his testimonies as it is written in the law of moses that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest and whithersoever thou turnest thyself that the lord may continue his word which he spake concerning me saying if thy children take heed to their way to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul there shall not fail thee said he a man on the throne of israel moreover thou knowest also what joab the son of zeruiah did to me and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of israel unto abner the son of ner and unto amasa the son of jether whom he slew and shed the blood of war in peace and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins and in his shoes that were on his feet do therefore according to thy wisdom and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace but shew kindness unto the sons of barzillai the gileadite and let them be of those that eat at thy table for so they came to me when i fled because of absalom thy brother and behold thou hast with thee shimei the son of gera a benjamite of bahurim which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when i went to mahanaim but he came down to meet me at jordan and i sware to him by the lord saying i will not put thee to death with the sword now therefore hold him not guiltless for thou art a wise man and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood so david slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of david and the days that david reigned over israel were forty years seven years reigned he in hebron and thirty and three years reigned he in jerusalem then sat solomon upon the throne of david his father and his kingdom was established greatly and adonijah the son of haggith came to bathsheba the mother of solomon and she said comest thou peaceably and he said peaceably he said moreover i have somewhat to say unto thee and she said say on and he said thou knowest that the kingdom was mine and that all israel set their faces on me that i should reign howbeit the kingdom is turned about and is become my brothers for it was his from the lord and now i ask one petition of thee deny me not and she said unto him say on and he said speak i pray thee unto solomon the king for he will not say thee nay that he give me abishag the shunammite to wife and bathsheba said well i will speak for thee unto the king bathsheba therefore went unto king solomon to speak unto him for adonijah and the king rose up to meet her and bowed himself unto her and sat down on his throne and caused a seat to be set for the kings mother and she sat on his right hand then she said i desire one small petition of thee i pray thee say me not nay and the king said unto her ask on my mother for i will not say thee nay and she said let abishag the shunammite be given to adonijah thy brother to wife and king solomon answered and said unto his mother and why dost thou ask abishag the shunammite for adonijah ask for him the kingdom also for he is mine elder brother even for him and for

the lord liveth which hath established me and set me on the throne of david my father and who hath made me an house as he promised adonijah shall be put to death this day and king solomon sent by the

at this time put thee to death because thou barest the ark of the lord god before david my father and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted so solomon thrust out abiathar from being priest unto the lord that he might fulfil the word of the lord which he spake concerning the house of eli in shiloh then tidings came to joab for joab had turned after adonijah though he turned not after absalom and joab fled unto the tabernacle of the lord and caught hold on the horns of the altar and it was told king solomon that joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the
