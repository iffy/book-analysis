the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem and those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem according to thine estimation for the money of five shekels after the shekel of the sanctuary which is twenty gerahs but the firstling of a cow or the firstling of a sheep or the firstling of a goat thou shalt not redeem they are holy thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire for a sweet savour unto the lord and the flesh of them shall be thine as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine all the heave offerings of the holy things which the children of israel offer unto the lord have i given thee and thy sons and thy daughters with thee by a statute for ever it is a covenant of salt for ever before the lord unto thee and to thy seed with thee and the lord spake unto aaron thou shalt have no inheritance in their land neither shalt thou have any part among them i am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of israel and behold i have given the children of levi all the tenth in israel for an inheritance for their service which they serve even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation neither must the children of israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation lest they bear sin and die but the levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation and they shall bear their iniquity it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations that among the children of israel they have no inheritance but the tithes of the children of israel which they offer as an heave offering unto the lord i have given to the levites to inherit therefore i have said unto them among the children of israel they shall have no inheritance and the lord spake unto moses saying thus speak unto the levites and say unto them when ye take of the children of israel the tithes which i have given you from them for your inheritance then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the lord even a tenth part of the tithe and this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you as though it were the corn of the threshingfloor and as the fulness of the winepress thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the lord of all your tithes which ye receive of the children of israel and ye shall give thereof the lords heave offering to aaron the priest out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the lord of all the best thereof even the hallowed part thereof out of it therefore thou shalt say unto them when ye have heaved the best thereof from it then it shall be counted unto the levites as the increase of the threshingfloor and as the increase of the winepress and ye shall eat it in every place ye and your households for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation and ye shall bear no sin by reason of it when ye have heaved from it the best of it neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of israel lest ye die and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying this is the ordinance of the law which the lord hath commanded saying speak unto the children of israel that they bring thee a red heifer without spot wherein is no blemish and upon which never came yoke and ye shall give her unto eleazar the priest that he may bring her forth without the camp and one shall slay her before his face and eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times and one shall burn the heifer in his sight her skin and her flesh and her blood with her dung shall he burn and the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer then the priest shall wash his clothes and he shall bathe his flesh in water and afterward he shall come into the camp and the priest shall be unclean until the even and he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water and bathe his flesh in water and shall be unclean until the even and a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and lay them up without the camp in a clean place and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of israel for a water of separation it is a purification for sin and he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the even and it shall be unto the children of israel and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them for a statute for ever he that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days he shall purify himself with it on the third day and on the seventh day he shall be clean but if he purify not himself the third day then the seventh day he shall not be clean whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead and purifieth not himself defileth the tabernacle of the lord and that soul shall be cut off from israel because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him he shall be unclean his uncleanness is yet upon him this is the law when a man dieth in a tent all that come into the tent and all that is in the tent shall be unclean seven days and every open vessel which hath no covering bound upon it is unclean and whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields or a dead body or a bone of a man or a grave shall be unclean seven days and for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin and running water shall be put thereto in
