in gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them it is in my desire that i should chastise them and the people shall be gathered against them when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows and ephraim is as an heifer that is taught and loveth to tread out the corn but i passed over upon her fair neck i will make ephraim to ride judah shall plow and jacob shall break his clods sow to yourselves in righteousness reap in mercy break up your fallow ground for it is time to seek the lord till he come and rain righteousness upon you ye have plowed wickedness ye have reaped iniquity ye have eaten the fruit of lies because thou didst trust in thy way in the multitude of thy mighty men therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled as shalman spoiled betharbel in the day of battle the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children so shall bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness in a morning shall the king of israel utterly be cut off when israel was a child then i loved him and called my son out of egypt as they called them so they went from them they sacrificed unto baalim and burned incense to graven images i taught ephraim also to go taking them by their arms but they knew not that i healed them i drew them with cords of a man with bands of love and i was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws and i laid meat unto them he shall not return into the land of egypt and the assyrian shall be his king because they refused to return and the sword shall abide on his cities and shall consume his branches and devour them because of their own counsels and my people are bent to backsliding from me though they called them to the most high none at all would exalt him how shall i give thee up ephraim how shall i deliver thee israel how shall i make thee as admah how shall i set thee as zeboim mine heart is turned within me my repentings are kindled together i will not execute the fierceness of mine anger i will not return to destroy ephraim for i am god and not man the holy one in the midst of thee and i will not enter into the city they shall walk after the lord he shall roar like a lion when he shall roar then the children shall tremble from the west they shall tremble as a bird out of egypt and as a dove out of the land of assyria and i will place them in their houses saith the lord ephraim compasseth me about with lies and the house of israel with deceit but judah yet ruleth with god and is faithful with the saints ephraim feedeth on wind and followeth after the east wind he daily increaseth lies and desolation and they do make a covenant with the assyrians and oil is carried into egypt the lord hath also a controversy with judah and will punish jacob according to his ways according to his doings will he recompense him he took his brother by the heel in the womb and by his strength he had power with god yea he had power over the angel and prevailed he wept and made supplication unto him he found him in bethel and there he spake with us even the lord god of hosts the lord is his memorial therefore turn thou to thy god keep mercy and judgment and wait on thy god continually he is a merchant the balances of deceit are in his hand he loveth to oppress and ephraim said yet i am become rich i have found me out substance in all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that were sin and i that am the lord thy god from the land of egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles as in the days of the solemn feast i have also spoken by the prophets and i have multiplied visions and used similitudes by the ministry of the prophets is there iniquity in gilead surely they are vanity they sacrifice bullocks in gilgal yea their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the fields and jacob fled into the country of syria and israel served for a wife and for a wife he kept sheep and by a prophet the lord brought israel out of egypt and by a prophet was he preserved ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly therefore shall he leave his blood upon him and his reproach shall his lord return unto him when ephraim spake trembling he exalted himself in israel but when he offended in baal he died and now they sin more and more and have made them molten images of their silver and idols according to their own understanding all of it the work of the craftsmen they say of them let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves therefore they shall be as the morning cloud and as the early dew that passeth away as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor and as the smoke out of the chimney yet i am the lord thy god from the land of egypt and thou shalt know no god but me for there is no saviour beside me i did know thee in the wilderness in the land of great drought according to their pasture so were they filled they were filled and their heart was exalted therefore have they forgotten me therefore i will be unto them as a lion as a leopard by the way will i observe them i will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps and will rend the caul of their heart and there will i devour them like a lion the wild beast shall tear them o israel thou hast destroyed thyself but in me is thine help i will be thy king where is any other that may save thee in all thy cities and thy judges of whom thou saidst give me a king and princes i gave thee
