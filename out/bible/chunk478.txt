saying take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people and come so baruch the son of neriah took the roll in his hand and came unto them and they said unto him sit down now and read it in our ears so baruch read it in their ears now it came to pass when they had heard all the words they were afraid both one and other and said unto baruch we will surely tell the king of all these words and they asked baruch saying tell us now how didst thou write all these words at his mouth then baruch answered them he pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth and i wrote them with ink in the book then said the princes unto baruch go hide thee thou and jeremiah and let no man know where ye be and they went in to the king into the court but they laid up the roll in the chamber of elishama the scribe and told all the words in the ears of the king so the king sent jehudi to fetch the roll and he took it out of elishama the scribes chamber and jehudi read it in the ears of the king and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him and it came to pass that when jehudi had read three or four leaves he cut it with the penknife and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth yet they were not afraid nor rent their garments neither the king nor any of his servants that heard all these words nevertheless elnathan and delaiah and gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll but he would not hear them but the king commanded jerahmeel the son of hammelech and seraiah the son of azriel and shelemiah the son of abdeel to take baruch the scribe and jeremiah the prophet but the lord hid them then the word of the lord came to jeremiah after that the king had burned the roll and the words which baruch wrote at the mouth of jeremiah saying take thee again another roll and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll which jehoiakim the king of judah hath burned and thou shalt say to jehoiakim king of judah thus saith the lord thou hast burned this roll saying why hast thou written therein saying the king of babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast therefore thus saith the lord of jehoiakim king of judah he shall have none to sit upon the throne of david and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat and in the night to the frost and i will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity and i will bring upon them and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem and upon the men of judah all the evil that i have pronounced against them but they hearkened not then took jeremiah another roll and gave it to baruch the scribe the son of neriah who wrote therein from the mouth of jeremiah all the words of the book which jehoiakim king of judah had burned in the fire and there were added besides unto them many like words and king zedekiah the son of josiah reigned instead of coniah the son of jehoiakim whom nebuchadrezzar king of babylon made king in the land of judah but neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land did hearken unto the words of the lord which he spake by the prophet jeremiah and zedekiah the king sent jehucal the son of shelemiah and zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest to the prophet jeremiah saying pray now unto the lord our god for us now jeremiah came in and went out among the people for they had not put him into prison then pharaohs army was come forth out of egypt and when the chaldeans that besieged jerusalem heard tidings of them they departed from jerusalem then came the word of the lord unto the prophet jeremiah saying thus saith the lord the god of israel thus shall ye say to the king of judah that sent you unto me to enquire of me behold pharaohs army which is come forth to help you shall return to egypt into their own land and the chaldeans shall come again and fight against this city and take it and burn it with fire thus saith the lord deceive not yourselves saying the chaldeans shall surely depart from us for they shall not depart for though ye had smitten the whole army of the chaldeans that fight against you and there remained but wounded men among them yet should they rise up every man in his tent and burn this city with fire and it came to pass that when the army of the chaldeans was broken up from jerusalem for fear of pharaohs army then jeremiah went forth out of jerusalem to go into the land of benjamin to separate himself thence in the midst of the people and when he was in the gate of benjamin a captain of the ward was there whose name was irijah the son of shelemiah the son of hananiah and he took jeremiah the prophet saying thou fallest away to the chaldeans then said jeremiah it is false i fall not away to the chaldeans but he hearkened not to him so irijah took jeremiah and brought him to the princes wherefore the princes were wroth with jeremiah and smote him and put him in prison in the house of jonathan the scribe for they had made that the prison when jeremiah was entered into the dungeon and into the cabins and jeremiah had remained there many days then zedekiah the king sent and took him out and the king asked him secretly in his house and said is there any word from the lord and jeremiah
