man of macedonia and prayed him saying come over into macedonia and help us and after he had seen the vision immediately we endeavoured to go into macedonia assuredly gathering that the lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them therefore loosing from troas we came with a straight course to samothracia and the next day to neapolis and from thence to philippi which is the chief city of that part of macedonia and a colony and we were in that city abiding certain days and on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side where prayer was wont to be made and we sat down and spake unto the women which resorted thither and a certain woman named lydia a seller of purple of the city of thyatira which worshipped god heard us whose heart the lord opened that she attended unto the things which were spoken of paul and when she was baptized and her household she besought us saying if ye have judged me to be faithful to the lord come into my house and abide there and she constrained us and it came to pass as we went to prayer a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying the same followed paul and us and cried saying these men are the servants of the most high god which shew unto us the way of salvation and this did she many days but paul being grieved turned and said to the spirit i command thee in the name of jesus christ to come out of her and he came out the same hour and when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone they caught paul and silas and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers and brought them to the magistrates saying these men being jews do exceedingly trouble our city and teach customs which are not lawful for us to receive neither to observe being romans and the multitude rose up together against them and the magistrates rent off their clothes and commanded to beat them and when they had laid many stripes upon them they cast them into prison charging the jailor to keep them safely who having received such a charge thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks and at midnight paul and silas prayed and sang praises unto god and the prisoners heard them and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were opened and every ones bands were loosed and the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep and seeing the prison doors open he drew out his sword and would have killed himself supposing that the prisoners had been fled but paul cried with a loud voice saying do thyself no harm for we are all here then he called for a light and sprang in and came trembling and fell down before paul and silas and brought them out and said sirs what must i do to be saved and they said believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house and they spake unto him the word of the lord and to all that were in his house and he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes and was baptized he and all his straightway and when he had brought them into his house he set meat before them and rejoiced believing in god with all his house and when it was day the magistrates sent the serjeants saying let those men go and the keeper of the prison told this saying to paul the magistrates have sent to let you go now therefore depart and go in peace but paul said unto them they have beaten us openly uncondemned being romans and have cast us into prison and now do they thrust us out privily nay verily but let them come themselves and fetch us out and the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates and they feared when they heard that they were romans and they came and besought them and brought them out and desired them to depart out of the city and they went out of the prison and entered into the house of lydia and when they had seen the brethren they comforted them and departed now when they had passed through amphipolis and apollonia they came to thessalonica where was a synagogue of the jews and paul as his manner was went in unto them and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures opening and alleging that christ must needs have suffered and risen again from the dead and that this jesus whom i preach unto you is christ and some of them believed and consorted with paul and silas and of the devout greeks a great multitude and of the chief women not a few but the jews which believed not moved with envy took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort and gathered a company and set all the city on an uproar and assaulted the house of jason and sought to bring them out to the people and when they found them not they drew jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city crying these that have turned the world upside down are come hither also whom jason hath received and these all do contrary to the decrees of caesar saying that there is another king one jesus and they troubled the people and the rulers of the city when they heard these things and when they had taken security of jason and of the other they let them go and the brethren immediately sent away paul and silas by night unto berea who coming thither went into the synagogue of the jews these were more noble than those in thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness of mind and searched the scriptures daily whether those things were so therefore many of them believed also of honourable women which were greeks and of men not a few but when the jews of thessalonica had knowledge that the word of god was preached of
