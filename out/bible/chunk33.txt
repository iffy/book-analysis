the sons of rachel which were born to jacob all the souls were fourteen and the sons of dan hushim and the sons of naphtali jahzeel and guni and jezer and shillem these are the sons of bilhah which laban gave unto rachel his daughter and she bare these unto jacob all the souls were seven all the souls that came with jacob into egypt which came out of his loins besides jacobs sons wives all the souls were threescore and six and the sons of joseph which were born him in egypt were two souls all the souls of the house of jacob which came into egypt were threescore and ten and he sent judah before him unto joseph to direct his face unto goshen and they came into the land of goshen and joseph made ready his chariot and went up to meet israel his father to goshen and presented himself unto him and he fell on his neck and wept on his neck a good while and israel said unto joseph now let me die since i have seen thy face because thou art yet alive and joseph said unto his brethren and unto his fathers house i will go up and shew pharaoh and say unto him my brethren and my fathers house which were in the land of canaan are come unto me and the men are shepherds for their trade hath been to feed cattle and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have and it shall come to pass when pharaoh shall call you and shall say what is your occupation that ye shall say thy servants trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now both we and also our fathers that ye may dwell in the land of goshen for every shepherd is an abomination unto the egyptians then joseph came and told pharaoh and said my father and my brethren and their flocks and their herds and all that they have are come out of the land of canaan and behold they are in the land of goshen and he took some of his brethren even five men and presented them unto pharaoh and pharaoh said unto his brethren what is your occupation and they said unto pharaoh thy servants are shepherds both we and also our fathers they said morever unto pharaoh for to sojourn in the land are we come for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks for the famine is sore in the land of canaan now therefore we pray thee let thy servants dwell in the land of goshen and pharaoh spake unto joseph saying thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee the land of egypt is before thee in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell in the land of goshen let them dwell and if thou knowest any men of activity among them then make them rulers over my cattle and joseph brought in jacob his father and set him before pharaoh and jacob blessed pharaoh and pharaoh said unto jacob how old art thou and jacob said unto pharaoh the days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years few and evil have the days of the years of my life been and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage and jacob blessed pharaoh and went out from before pharaoh and joseph placed his father and his brethren and gave them a possession in the land of egypt in the best of the land in the land of rameses as pharaoh had commanded and joseph nourished his father and his brethren and all his fathers household with bread according to their families and there was no bread in all the land for the famine was very sore so that the land of egypt and all the land of canaan fainted by reason of the famine and joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of egypt and in the land of canaan for the corn which they bought and joseph brought the money into pharaohs house and when money failed in the land of egypt and in the land of canaan all the egyptians came unto joseph and said give us bread for why should we die in thy presence for the money faileth and joseph said give your cattle and i will give you for your cattle if money fail and they brought their cattle unto joseph and joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses and for the flocks and for the cattle of the herds and for the asses and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year when that year was ended they came unto him the second year and said unto him we will not hide it from my lord how that our money is spent my lord also hath our herds of cattle there is not ought left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands wherefore shall we die before thine eyes both we and our land buy us and our land for bread and we and our land will be servants unto pharaoh and give us seed that we may live and not die that the land be not desolate and joseph bought all the land of egypt for pharaoh for the egyptians sold every man his field because the famine prevailed over them so the land became pharaohs and as for the people he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of egypt even to the other end thereof only the land of the priests bought he not for the priests had a portion assigned them of pharaoh and did eat their portion which pharaoh gave them wherefore they sold not their lands then joseph said unto the people behold i have bought you this day and your land for pharaoh lo here is seed for you and ye shall sow the land and it shall come to pass in the increase that ye shall give the fifth part unto pharaoh and four parts shall be your own for seed of the field and for your food and for them of your households and
