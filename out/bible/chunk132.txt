if the way be too long for thee so that thou art not able to carry it or if the place be too far from thee which the lord thy god shall choose to set his name there when the lord thy god hath blessed thee then shalt thou turn it into money and bind up the money in thine hand and shalt go unto the place which the lord thy god shall choose and thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after for oxen or for sheep or for wine or for strong drink or for whatsoever thy soul desireth and thou shalt eat there before the lord thy god and thou shalt rejoice thou and thine household and the levite that is within thy gates thou shalt not forsake him for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee at the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year and shalt lay it up within thy gates and the levite because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee and the stranger and the fatherless and the widow which are within thy gates shall come and shall eat and be satisfied that the lord thy god may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou doest at the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release and this is the manner of the release every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it he shall not exact it of his neighbour or of his brother because it is called the lords release of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again but that which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release save when there shall be no poor among you for the lord shall greatly bless thee in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe to do all these commandments which i command thee this day for the lord thy god blesseth thee as he promised thee and thou shalt lend unto many nations but thou shalt not borrow and thou shalt reign over many nations but they shall not reign over thee if there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the lord thy god giveth thee thou shalt not harden thine heart nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother but thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need in that which he wanteth beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart saying the seventh year the year of release is at hand and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother and thou givest him nought and he cry unto the lord against thee and it be sin unto thee thou shalt surely give him and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him because that for this thing the lord thy god shall bless thee in all thy works and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto for the poor shall never cease out of the land therefore i command thee saying thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother to thy poor and to thy needy in thy land and if thy brother an hebrew man or an hebrew woman be sold unto thee and serve thee six years then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee and when thou sendest him out free from thee thou shalt not let him go away empty thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock and out of thy floor and out of thy winepress of that wherewith the lord thy god hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of egypt and the lord thy god redeemed thee therefore i command thee this thing to day and it shall be if he say unto thee i will not go away from thee because he loveth thee and thine house because he is well with thee then thou shalt take an aul and thrust it through his ear unto the door and he shall be thy servant for ever and also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise it shall not seem hard unto thee when thou sendest him away free from thee for he hath been worth a double hired servant to thee in serving thee six years and the lord thy god shall bless thee in all that thou doest all the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the lord thy god thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy bullock nor shear the firstling of thy sheep thou shalt eat it before the lord thy god year by year in the place which the lord shall choose thou and thy household and if there be any blemish therein as if it be lame or blind or have any ill blemish thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the lord thy god thou shalt eat it within thy gates the unclean and the clean person shall eat it alike as the roebuck and as the hart only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof thou shalt pour it upon the ground as water observe the month of abib and keep the passover unto the lord thy god for in the month of abib the lord thy god brought thee forth out of egypt by night thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the lord thy god of the flock and the herd in the place which the lord shall choose to place his name there thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith even the bread of affliction for thou camest forth out of the land of egypt in haste that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of egypt all the days of thy life and there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast seven days neither shall there any thing
