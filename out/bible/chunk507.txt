fruit her strong rods were broken and withered the fire consumed them and now she is planted in the wilderness in a dry and thirsty ground and fire is gone out of a rod of her branches which hath devoured her fruit so that she hath no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule this is a lamentation and shall be for a lamentation and it came to pass in the seventh year in the fifth month the tenth day of the month that certain of the elders of israel came to enquire of the lord and sat before me then came the word of the lord unto me saying son of man speak unto the elders of israel and say unto them thus saith the lord god are ye come to enquire of me as i live saith the lord god i will not be enquired of by you wilt thou judge them son of man wilt thou judge them cause them to know the abominations of their fathers and say unto them thus saith the lord god in the day when i chose israel and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of jacob and made myself known unto them in the land of egypt when i lifted up mine hand unto them saying i am the lord your god in the day that i lifted up mine hand unto them to bring them forth of the land of egypt into a land that i had espied for them flowing with milk and honey which is the glory of all lands then said i unto them cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes and defile not yourselves with the idols of egypt i am the lord your god but they rebelled against me and would not hearken unto me they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes neither did they forsake the idols of egypt then i said i will pour out my fury upon them to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of egypt but i wrought for my names sake that it should not be polluted before the heathen among whom they were in whose sight i made myself known unto them in bringing them forth out of the land of egypt wherefore i caused them to go forth out of the land of egypt and brought them into the wilderness and i gave them my statutes and shewed them my judgments which if a man do he shall even live in them moreover also i gave them my sabbaths to be a sign between me and them that they might know that i am the lord that sanctify them but the house of israel rebelled against me in the wilderness they walked not in my statutes and they despised my judgments which if a man do he shall even live in them and my sabbaths they greatly polluted then i said i would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness to consume them but i wrought for my names sake that it should not be polluted before the heathen in whose sight i brought them out yet also i lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness that i would not bring them into the land which i had given them flowing with milk and honey which is the glory of all lands because they despised my judgments and walked not in my statutes but polluted my sabbaths for their heart went after their idols nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them neither did i make an end of them in the wilderness but i said unto their children in the wilderness walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers neither observe their judgments nor defile yourselves with their idols i am the lord your god walk in my statutes and keep my judgments and do them and hallow my sabbaths and they shall be a sign between me and you that ye may know that i am the lord your god notwithstanding the children rebelled against me they walked not in my statutes neither kept my judgments to do them which if a man do he shall even live in them they polluted my sabbaths then i said i would pour out my fury upon them to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness nevertheless i withdrew mine hand and wrought for my names sake that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen in whose sight i brought them forth i lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness that i would scatter them among the heathen and disperse them through the countries because they had not executed my judgments but had despised my statutes and had polluted my sabbaths and their eyes were after their fathers idols wherefore i gave them also statutes that were not good and judgments whereby they should not live and i polluted them in their own gifts in that they caused to pass through the fire all that openeth the womb that i might make them desolate to the end that they might know that i am the lord therefore son of man speak unto the house of israel and say unto them thus saith the lord god yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me in that they have committed a trespass against me for when i had brought them into the land for the which i lifted up mine hand to give it to them then they saw every high hill and all the thick trees and they offered there their sacrifices and there they presented the provocation of their offering there also they made their sweet savour and poured out there their drink offerings then i said unto them what is the high place whereunto ye go and the name whereof is called bamah unto this day wherefore say unto the house of israel thus saith the lord god are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers and commit ye whoredom after their abominations for when ye offer your gifts when ye make your sons to pass through the fire ye pollute yourselves with all your idols even unto this day and shall i be enquired of by you o house of israel as
