all of them snared in holes and they are hid in prison houses they are for a prey and none delivereth for a spoil and none saith restore who among you will give ear to this who will hearken and hear for the time to come who gave jacob for a spoil and israel to the robbers did not the lord he against whom we have sinned for they would not walk in his ways neither were they obedient unto his law therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger and the strength of battle and it hath set him on fire round about yet he knew not and it burned him yet he laid it not to heart but now thus saith the lord that created thee o jacob and he that formed thee o israel fear not for i have redeemed thee i have called thee by thy name thou art mine when thou passest through the waters i will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walkest through the fire thou shalt not be burned neither shall the flame kindle upon thee for i am the lord thy god the holy one of israel thy saviour i gave egypt for thy ransom ethiopia and seba for thee since thou wast precious in my sight thou hast been honourable and i have loved thee therefore will i give men for thee and people for thy life fear not for i am with thee i will bring thy seed from the east and gather thee from the west i will say to the north give up and to the south keep not back bring my sons from far and my daughters from the ends of the earth even every one that is called by my name for i have created him for my glory i have formed him yea i have made him bring forth the blind people that have eyes and the deaf that have ears let all the nations be gathered together and let the people be assembled who among them can declare this and shew us former things let them bring forth their witnesses that they may be justified or let them hear and say it is truth ye are my witnesses saith the lord and my servant whom i have chosen that ye may know and believe me and understand that i am he before me there was no god formed neither shall there be after me i even i am the lord and beside me there is no saviour i have declared and have saved and i have shewed when there was no strange god among you therefore ye are my witnesses saith the lord that i am god yea before the day was i am he and there is none that can deliver out of my hand i will work and who shall let it thus saith the lord your redeemer the holy one of israel for your sake i have sent to babylon and have brought down all their nobles and the chaldeans whose cry is in the ships i am the lord your holy one the creator of israel your king thus saith the lord which maketh a way in the sea and a path in the mighty waters which bringeth forth the chariot and horse the army and the power they shall lie down together they shall not rise they are extinct they are quenched as tow remember ye not the former things neither consider the things of old behold i will do a new thing now it shall spring forth shall ye not know it i will even make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert the beast of the field shall honour me the dragons and the owls because i give waters in the wilderness and rivers in the desert to give drink to my people my chosen this people have i formed for myself they shall shew forth my praise but thou hast not called upon me o jacob but thou hast been weary of me o israel thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices i have not caused thee to serve with an offering nor wearied thee with incense thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities i even i am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake and will not remember thy sins put me in remembrance let us plead together declare thou that thou mayest be justified thy first father hath sinned and thy teachers have transgressed against me therefore i have profaned the princes of the sanctuary and have given jacob to the curse and israel to reproaches yet now hear o jacob my servant and israel whom i have chosen thus saith the lord that made thee and formed thee from the womb which will help thee fear not o jacob my servant and thou jesurun whom i have chosen for i will pour water upon him that is thirsty and floods upon the dry ground i will pour my spirit upon thy seed and my blessing upon thine offspring and they shall spring up as among the grass as willows by the water courses one shall say i am the lords and another shall call himself by the name of jacob and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the lord and surname himself by the name of israel thus saith the lord the king of israel and his redeemer the lord of hosts i am the first and i am the last and beside me there is no god and who as i shall call and shall declare it and set it in order for me since i appointed the ancient people and the things that are coming and shall come let them shew unto them fear ye not neither be afraid have not i told thee from that time and have declared it ye are even my witnesses is there a god beside me yea there is no god i know not any they that make a graven image
