thus saith the lord god behold i am against thee pharaoh king of egypt the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers which hath said my river is mine own and i have made it for myself but i will put hooks in thy jaws and i will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales and i will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales and i will leave thee thrown into the wilderness thee and all the fish of thy rivers thou shalt fall upon the open fields thou shalt not be brought together nor gathered i have given thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven and all the inhabitants of egypt shall know that i am the lord because they have been a staff of reed to the house of israel when they took hold of thee by thy hand thou didst break and rend all their shoulder and when they leaned upon thee thou brakest and madest all their loins to be at a stand therefore thus saith the lord god behold i will bring a sword upon thee and cut off man and beast out of thee and the land of egypt shall be desolate and waste and they shall know that i am the lord because he hath said the river is mine and i have made it behold therefore i am against thee and against thy rivers and i will make the land of egypt utterly waste and desolate from the tower of syene even unto the border of ethiopia no foot of man shall pass through it nor foot of beast shall pass through it neither shall it be inhabited forty years and i will make the land of egypt desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be desolate forty years and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations and will disperse them through the countries yet thus saith the lord god at the end of forty years will i gather the egyptians from the people whither they were scattered and i will bring again the captivity of egypt and will cause them to return into the land of pathros into the land of their habitation and they shall be there a base kingdom it shall be the basest of the kingdoms neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations for i will diminish them that they shall no more rule over the nations and it shall be no more the confidence of the house of israel which bringeth their iniquity to remembrance when they shall look after them but they shall know that i am the lord god and it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year in the first month in the first day of the month the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man nebuchadrezzar king of babylon caused his army to serve a great service against tyrus every head was made bald and every shoulder was peeled yet had he no wages nor his army for tyrus for the service that he had served against it therefore thus saith the lord god behold i will give the land of egypt unto nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and he shall take her multitude and take her spoil and take her prey and it shall be the wages for his army i have given him the land of egypt for his labour wherewith he served against it because they wrought for me saith the lord god in that day will i cause the horn of the house of israel to bud forth and i will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them and they shall know that i am the lord the word of the lord came again unto me saying son of man prophesy and say thus saith the lord god howl ye woe worth the day for the day is near even the day of the lord is near a cloudy day it shall be the time of the heathen and the sword shall come upon egypt and great pain shall be in ethiopia when the slain shall fall in egypt and they shall take away her multitude and her foundations shall be broken down ethiopia and libya and lydia and all the mingled people and chub and the men of the land that is in league shall fall with them by the sword thus saith the lord they also that uphold egypt shall fall and the pride of her power shall come down from the tower of syene shall they fall in it by the sword saith the lord god and they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted and they shall know that i am the lord when i have set a fire in egypt and when all her helpers shall be destroyed in that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make the careless ethiopians afraid and great pain shall come upon them as in the day of egypt for lo it cometh thus saith the lord god i will also make the multitude of egypt to cease by the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon he and his people with him the terrible of the nations shall be brought to destroy the land and they shall draw their swords against egypt and fill the land with the slain and i will make the rivers dry and sell the land into the hand of the wicked and i will make the land waste and all that is therein by the hand of strangers i the lord have spoken it thus saith the lord god i will also destroy the idols and i will cause their images to cease out of noph and there shall be no more a prince of the land of egypt and i will put a fear in the land of egypt and i will make pathros desolate and will set fire in zoan and will execute judgments in no and
