reigned in the thirty and first year of asa king of judah began omri to reign over israel twelve years six years reigned he in tirzah and he bought the hill samaria of shemer for two talents of silver and built on the hill and called the name of the city which he built after the name of shemer owner of the hill samaria but omri wrought evil in the eyes of the lord and did worse than all that were before him for he walked in all the way of jeroboam the son of nebat and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin to provoke the lord god of israel to anger with their vanities now the rest of the acts of omri which he did and his might that he shewed are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel so omri slept with his fathers and was buried in samaria and ahab his son reigned in his stead and in the thirty and eighth year of asa king of judah began ahab the son of omri to reign over israel and ahab the son of omri reigned over israel in samaria twenty and two years and ahab the son of omri did evil in the sight of the lord above all that were before him and it came to pass as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat that he took to wife jezebel the daughter of ethbaal king of the zidonians and went and served baal and worshipped him and he reared up an altar for baal in the house of baal which he had built in samaria and ahab made a grove and ahab did more to provoke the lord god of israel to anger than all the kings of israel that were before him in his days did hiel the bethelite build jericho he laid the foundation thereof in abiram his firstborn and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son segub according to the word of the lord which he spake by joshua the son of nun and elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of gilead said unto ahab as the lord god of israel liveth before whom i stand there shall not be dew nor rain these years but according to my word and the word of the lord came unto him saying get thee hence and turn thee eastward and hide thyself by the brook cherith that is before jordan and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the brook and i have commanded the ravens to feed thee there so he went and did according unto the word of the lord for he went and dwelt by the brook cherith that is before jordan and the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook and it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land and the word of the lord came unto him saying arise get thee to zarephath which belongeth to zidon and dwell there behold i have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee so he arose and went to zarephath and when he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there gathering of sticks and he called to her and said fetch me i pray thee a little water in a vessel that i may drink and as she was going to fetch it he called to her and said bring me i pray thee a morsel of bread in thine hand and she said as the lord thy god liveth i have not a cake but an handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruse and behold i am gathering two sticks that i may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die and elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou hast said but make me thereof a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy son for thus saith the lord god of israel the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the cruse of oil fail until the day that the lord sendeth rain upon the earth and she went and did according to the saying of elijah and she and he and her house did eat many days and the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the cruse of oil fail according to the word of the lord which he spake by elijah and it came to pass after these things that the son of the woman the mistress of the house fell sick and his sickness was so sore that there was no breath left in him and she said unto elijah what have i to do with thee o thou man of god art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance and to slay my son and he said unto her give me thy son and he took him out of her bosom and carried him up into a loft where he abode and laid him upon his own bed and he cried unto the lord and said o lord my god hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom i sojourn by slaying her son and he stretched himself upon the child three times and cried unto the lord and said o lord my god i pray thee let this childs soul come into him again and the lord heard the voice of elijah and the soul of the child came into him again and he revived and elijah took the child and brought him down out of the chamber into the house and delivered him unto his mother and elijah said see thy son liveth and the woman said to elijah now by this i know that thou art a man of god and that the word of the lord in thy mouth is truth and it came to pass after many days that the word of the lord came to elijah in the third year saying
