for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers and who then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the lord then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds with the rulers of the kings work offered willingly and gave for the service of the house of god of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams and of silver ten thousand talents and of brass eighteen thousand talents and one hundred thousand talents of iron and they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the lord by the hand of jehiel the gershonite then the people rejoiced for that they offered willingly because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the lord and david the king also rejoiced with great joy wherefore david blessed the lord before all the congregation and david said blessed be thou lord god of israel our father for ever and ever thine o lord is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine thine is the kingdom o lord and thou art exalted as head above all both riches and honour come of thee and thou reignest over all and in thine hand is power and might and in thine hand it is to make great and to give strength unto all now therefore our god we thank thee and praise thy glorious name but who am i and what is my people that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort for all things come of thee and of thine own have we given thee for we are strangers before thee and sojourners as were all our fathers our days on the earth are as a shadow and there is none abiding o lord our god all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand and is all thine own i know also my god that thou triest the heart and hast pleasure in uprightness as for me in the uprightness of mine heart i have willingly offered all these things and now have i seen with joy thy people which are present here to offer willingly unto thee o lord god of abraham isaac and of israel our fathers keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people and prepare their heart unto thee and give unto solomon my son a perfect heart to keep thy commandments thy testimonies and thy statutes and to do all these things and to build the palace for the which i have made provision and david said to all the congregation now bless the lord your god and all the congregation blessed the lord god of their fathers and bowed down their heads and worshipped the lord and the king and they sacrificed sacrifices unto the lord and offered burnt offerings unto the lord on the morrow after that day even a thousand bullocks a thousand rams and a thousand lambs with their drink offerings and sacrifices in abundance for all israel and did eat and drink before the lord on that day with great gladness and they made solomon the son of david king the second time and anointed him unto the lord to be the chief governor and zadok to be priest then solomon sat on the throne of the lord as king instead of david his father and prospered and all israel obeyed him and all the princes and the mighty men and all the sons likewise of king david submitted themselves unto solomon the king and the lord magnified solomon exceedingly in the sight of all israel and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in israel thus david the son of jesse reigned over all israel and the time that he reigned over israel was forty years seven years reigned he in hebron and thirty and three years reigned he in jerusalem and he died in a good old age full of days riches and honour and solomon his son reigned in his stead now the acts of david the king first and last behold they are written in the book of samuel the seer and in the book of nathan the prophet and in the book of gad the seer with all his reign and his might and the times that went over him and over israel and over all the kingdoms of the countries the second book of the chronicles and solomon the son of david was strengthened in his
