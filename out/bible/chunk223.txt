his clothes from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace and it came to pass when he was come to jerusalem to meet the king that the king said unto him wherefore wentest not thou with me mephibosheth and he answered my lord o king my servant deceived me for thy servant said i will saddle me an ass that i may ride thereon and go to the king because thy servant is lame and he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king but my lord the king is as an angel of god do therefore what is good in thine eyes for all of my fathers house were but dead men before my lord the king yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table what right therefore have i yet to cry any more unto the king and the king said unto him why speakest thou any more of thy matters i have said thou and ziba divide the land and mephibosheth said unto the king yea let him take all forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house and barzillai the gileadite came down from rogelim and went over jordan with the king to conduct him over jordan now barzillai was a very aged man even fourscore years old and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at mahanaim for he was a very great man and the king said unto barzillai come thou over with me and i will feed thee with me in jerusalem and barzillai said unto the king how long have i to live that i should go up with the king unto jerusalem i am this day fourscore years old and can i discern between good and evil can thy servant taste what i eat or what i drink can i hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king thy servant will go a little way over jordan with the king and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward let thy servant i pray thee turn back again that i may die in mine own city and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother but behold thy servant chimham let him go over with my lord the king and do to him what shall seem good unto thee and the king answered chimham shall go over with me and i will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee and whatsoever thou shalt require of me that will i do for thee and all the people went over jordan and when the king was come over the king kissed barzillai and blessed him and he returned unto his own place then the king went on to gilgal and chimham went on with him and all the people of judah conducted the king and also half the people of israel and behold all the men of israel came to the king and said unto the king why have our brethren the men of judah stolen thee away and have brought the king and his household and all davids men with him over jordan and all the men of judah answered the men of israel because the king is near of kin to us wherefore then be ye angry for this matter have we eaten at all of the kings cost or hath he given us any gift and the men of israel answered the men of judah and said we have ten parts in the king and we have also more right in david than ye why then did ye despise us that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king and the words of the men of judah were fiercer than the words of the men of israel and there happened to be there a man of belial whose name was sheba the son of bichri a benjamite and he blew a trumpet and said we have no part in david neither have we inheritance in the son of jesse every man to his tents o israel so every man of israel went up from after david and followed sheba the son of bichri but the men of judah clave unto their king from jordan even to jerusalem and david came to his house at jerusalem and the king took the ten women his concubines whom he had left to keep the house and put them in ward and fed them but went not in unto them so they were shut up unto the day of their death living in widowhood then said the king to amasa assemble me the men of judah within three days and be thou here present so amasa went to assemble the men of judah but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him and david said to abishai now shall sheba the son of bichri do us more harm than did absalom take thou thy lords servants and pursue after him lest he get him fenced cities and escape us and there went out after him joabs men and the cherethites and the pelethites and all the mighty men and they went out of jerusalem to pursue after sheba the son of bichri when they were at the great stone which is in gibeon amasa went before them and joabs garment that he had put on was girded unto him and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof and as he went forth it fell out and joab said to amasa art thou in health my brother and joab took amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him but amasa took no heed to the sword that was in joabs hand so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib and shed out his bowels to the ground and struck him not again and he died so joab and abishai his brother pursued after sheba the son of bichri and one of joabs men stood by him and said he that favoureth joab and he that is for david let him go after
