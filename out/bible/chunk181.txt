israel encouraged themselves and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day and the children of israel went up and wept before the lord until even and asked counsel of the lord saying shall i go up again to battle against the children of benjamin my brother and the lord said go up against him and the children of israel came near against the children of benjamin the second day and benjamin went forth against them out of gibeah the second day and destroyed down to the ground of the children of israel again eighteen thousand men all these drew the sword then all the children of israel and all the people went up and came unto the house of god and wept and sat there before the lord and fasted that day until even and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the lord and the children of israel enquired of the lord for the ark of the covenant of god was there in those days and phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron stood before it in those days saying shall i yet again go out to battle against the children of benjamin my brother or shall i cease and the lord said go up for to morrow i will deliver them into thine hand and israel set liers in wait round about gibeah and the children of israel went up against the children of benjamin on the third day and put themselves in array against gibeah as at other times and the children of benjamin went out against the people and were drawn away from the city and they began to smite of the people and kill as at other times in the highways of which one goeth up to the house of god and the other to gibeah in the field about thirty men of israel and the children of benjamin said they are smitten down before us as at the first but the children of israel said let us flee and draw them from the city unto the highways and all the men of israel rose up out of their place and put themselves in array at baaltamar and the liers in wait of israel came forth out of their places even out of the meadows of gibeah and there came against gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all israel and the battle was sore but they knew not that evil was near them and the lord smote benjamin before israel and the children of israel destroyed of the benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men all these drew the sword so the children of benjamin saw that they were smitten for the men of israel gave place to the benjamites because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside gibeah and the liers in wait hasted and rushed upon gibeah and the liers in wait drew themselves along and smote all the city with the edge of the sword now there was an appointed sign between the men of israel and the liers in wait that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city and when the men of israel retired in the battle benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of israel about thirty persons for they said surely they are smitten down before us as in the first battle but when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke the benjamites looked behind them and behold the flame of the city ascended up to heaven and when the men of israel turned again the men of benjamin were amazed for they saw that evil was come upon them therefore they turned their backs before the men of israel unto the way of the wilderness but the battle overtook them and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them thus they inclosed the benjamites round about and chased them and trode them down with ease over against gibeah toward the sunrising and there fell of benjamin eighteen thousand men all these were men of valour and they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of rimmon and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men and pursued hard after them unto gidom and slew two thousand men of them so that all which fell that day of benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword all these were men of valour but six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock rimmon and abode in the rock rimmon four months and the men of israel turned again upon the children of benjamin and smote them with the edge of the sword as well the men of every city as the beast and all that came to hand also they set on fire all the cities that they came to now the men of israel had sworn in mizpeh saying there shall not any of us give his daughter unto benjamin to wife and the people came to the house of god and abode there till even before god and lifted up their voices and wept sore and said o lord god of israel why is this come to pass in israel that there should be to day one tribe lacking in israel and it came to pass on the morrow that the people rose early and built there an altar and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings and the children of israel said who is there among all the tribes of israel that came not up with the congregation unto the lord for they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the lord to mizpeh saying he shall surely be put to death and the children of israel repented them for benjamin their brother and said there is one tribe cut off from israel this day how shall we do for wives for them that remain seeing we have sworn by the lord that we will not give them of our daughters to wives and they said what one is there of the tribes of israel that came not up to mizpeh to the
