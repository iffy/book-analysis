shall be built again and the wall even in troublous times and after threescore and two weeks shall messiah be cut off but not for himself and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary and the end thereof shall be with a flood and unto the end of the war desolations are determined and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even until the consummation and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate in the third year of cyrus king of persia a thing was revealed unto daniel whose name was called belteshazzar and the thing was true but the time appointed was long and he understood the thing and had understanding of the vision in those days i daniel was mourning three full weeks i ate no pleasant bread neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth neither did i anoint myself at all till three whole weeks were fulfilled and in the four and twentieth day of the first month as i was by the side of the great river which is hiddekel then i lifted up mine eyes and looked and behold a certain man clothed in linen whose loins were girded with fine gold of uphaz his body also was like the beryl and his face as the appearance of lightning and his eyes as lamps of fire and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude and i daniel alone saw the vision for the men that were with me saw not the vision but a great quaking fell upon them so that they fled to hide themselves therefore i was left alone and saw this great vision and there remained no strength in me for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption and i retained no strength yet heard i the voice of his words and when i heard the voice of his words then was i in a deep sleep on my face and my face toward the ground and behold an hand touched me which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands and he said unto me o daniel a man greatly beloved understand the words that i speak unto thee and stand upright for unto thee am i now sent and when he had spoken this word unto me i stood trembling then said he unto me fear not daniel for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand and to chasten thyself before thy god thy words were heard and i am come for thy words but the prince of the kingdom of persia withstood me one and twenty days but lo michael one of the chief princes came to help me and i remained there with the kings of persia now i am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days for yet the vision is for many days and when he had spoken such words unto me i set my face toward the ground and i became dumb and behold one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips then i opened my mouth and spake and said unto him that stood before me o my lord by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me and i have retained no strength for how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord for as for me straightway there remained no strength in me neither is there breath left in me then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man and he strengthened me and said o man greatly beloved fear not peace be unto thee be strong yea be strong and when he had spoken unto me i was strengthened and said let my lord speak for thou hast strengthened me then said he knowest thou wherefore i come unto thee and now will i return to fight with the prince of persia and when i am gone forth lo the prince of grecia shall come but i will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth and there is none that holdeth with me in these things but michael your prince also i in the first year of darius the mede even i stood to confirm and to strengthen him and now will i shew thee the truth behold there shall stand up yet three kings in persia and the fourth shall be far richer than they all and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of grecia and a mighty king shall stand up that shall rule with great dominion and do according to his will and when he shall stand up his kingdom shall be broken and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven and not to his posterity nor according to his dominion which he ruled for his kingdom shall be plucked up even for others beside those and the king of the south shall be strong and one of his princes and he shall be strong above him and have dominion his dominion shall be a great dominion and in the end of years they shall join themselves together for the kings daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement but she shall not retain the power of the arm neither shall he stand nor his arm but she shall be given up and they that brought her and he that begat her and he that strengthened her in these times but out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate which shall come with an army and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north and shall deal against them and shall prevail and shall also carry captives into egypt their gods with their princes and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold and he shall continue more years than the king of the north so the
