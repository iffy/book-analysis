the son of aphiah a benjamite a mighty man of power and he had a son whose name was saul a choice young man and a goodly and there was not among the children of israel a goodlier person than he from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people and the asses of kish sauls father were lost and kish said to saul his son take now one of the servants with thee and arise go seek the asses and he passed through mount ephraim and passed through the land of shalisha but they found them not then they passed through the land of shalim and there they were not and he passed through the land of the benjamites but they found them not and when they were come to the land of zuph saul said to his servant that was with him come and let us return lest my father leave caring for the asses and take thought for us and he said unto him behold now there is in this city a man of god and he is an honourable man all that he saith cometh surely to pass now let us go thither peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go then said saul to his servant but behold if we go what shall we bring the man for the bread is spent in our vessels and there is not a present to bring to the man of god what have we and the servant answered saul again and said behold i have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver that will i give to the man of god to tell us our way beforetime in israel when a man went to enquire of god thus he spake come and let us go to the seer for he that is now called a prophet was beforetime called a seer then said saul to his servant well said come let us go so they went unto the city where the man of god was and as they went up the hill to the city they found young maidens going out to draw water and said unto them is the seer here and they answered them and said he is behold he is before you make haste now for he came to day to the city for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place as soon as ye be come into the city ye shall straightway find him before he go up to the high place to eat for the people will not eat until he come because he doth bless the sacrifice and afterwards they eat that be bidden now therefore get you up for about this time ye shall find him and they went up into the city and when they were come into the city behold samuel came out against them for to go up to the high place now the lord had told samuel in his ear a day before saul came saying to morrow about this time i will send thee a man out of the land of benjamin and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people israel that he may save my people out of the hand of the philistines for i have looked upon my people because their cry is come unto me and when samuel saw saul the lord said unto him behold the man whom i spake to thee of this same shall reign over my people then saul drew near to samuel in the gate and said tell me i pray thee where the seers house is and samuel answered saul and said i am the seer go up before me unto the high place for ye shall eat with me to day and to morrow i will let thee go and will tell thee all that is in thine heart and as for thine asses that were lost three days ago set not thy mind on them for they are found and on whom is all the desire of israel is it not on thee and on all thy fathers house and saul answered and said am not i a benjamite of the smallest of the tribes of israel and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of benjamin wherefore then speakest thou so to me and samuel took saul and his servant and brought them into the parlour and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden which were about thirty persons and samuel said unto the cook bring the portion which i gave thee of which i said unto thee set it by thee and the cook took up the shoulder and that which was upon it and set it before saul and samuel said behold that which is left set it before thee and eat for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since i said i have invited the people so saul did eat with samuel that day and when they were come down from the high place into the city samuel communed with saul upon the top of the house and they arose early and it came to pass about the spring of the day that samuel called saul to the top of the house saying up that i may send thee away and saul arose and they went out both of them he and samuel abroad and as they were going down to the end of the city samuel said to saul bid the servant pass on before us and he passed on but stand thou still a while that i may shew thee the word of god then samuel took a vial of oil and poured it upon his head and kissed him and said is it not because the lord hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance when thou art departed from me to day then thou shalt find two men by rachels sepulchre in the border of benjamin at zelzah and they will say unto thee the asses which thou wentest to seek are found and lo thy father hath left the care of the asses and sorroweth for you saying what shall i do for my son then shalt thou go on forward
