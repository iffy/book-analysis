thou contendest with me is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands and shine upon the counsel of the wicked hast thou eyes of flesh or seest thou as man seeth are thy days as the days of man are thy years as mans days that thou enquirest after mine iniquity and searchest after my sin thou knowest that i am not wicked and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about yet thou dost destroy me remember i beseech thee that thou hast made me as the clay and wilt thou bring me into dust again hast thou not poured me out as milk and curdled me like cheese thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh and hast fenced me with bones and sinews thou hast granted me life and favour and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit and these things hast thou hid in thine heart i know that this is with thee if i sin then thou markest me and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity if i be wicked woe unto me and if i be righteous yet will i not lift up my head i am full of confusion therefore see thou mine affliction for it increaseth thou huntest me as a fierce lion and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me thou renewest thy witnesses against me and increasest thine indignation upon me changes and war are against me wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb oh that i had given up the ghost and no eye had seen me i should have been as though i had not been i should have been carried from the womb to the grave are not my days few cease then and let me alone that i may take comfort a little before i go whence i shall not return even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death a land of darkness as darkness itself and of the shadow of death without any order and where the light is as darkness then answered zophar the naamathite and said should not the multitude of words be answered and should a man full of talk be justified should thy lies make men hold their peace and when thou mockest shall no man make thee ashamed for thou hast said my doctrine is pure and i am clean in thine eyes but oh that god would speak and open his lips against thee and that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom that they are double to that which is know therefore that god exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth canst thou by searching find out god canst thou find out the almighty unto perfection it is as high as heaven what canst thou do deeper than hell what canst thou know the measure thereof is longer than the earth and broader than the sea if he cut off and shut up or gather together then who can hinder him for he knoweth vain men he seeth wickedness also will he not then consider it for vain men would be wise though man be born like a wild asss colt if thou prepare thine heart and stretch out thine hands toward him if iniquity be in thine hand put it far away and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles for then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot yea thou shalt be stedfast and shalt not fear because thou shalt forget thy misery and remember it as waters that pass away and thine age shall be clearer than the noonday thou shalt shine forth thou shalt be as the morning and thou shalt be secure because there is hope yea thou shalt dig about thee and thou shalt take thy rest in safety also thou shalt lie down and none shall make thee afraid yea many shall make suit unto thee but the eyes of the wicked shall fail and they shall not escape and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost and job answered and said no doubt but ye are the people and wisdom shall die with you but i have understanding as well as you i am not inferior to you yea who knoweth not such things as these i am as one mocked of his neighbour who calleth upon god and he answereth him the just upright man is laughed to scorn he that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease the tabernacles of robbers prosper and they that provoke god are secure into whose hand god bringeth abundantly but ask now the beasts and they shall teach thee and the fowls of the air and they shall tell thee or speak to the earth and it shall teach thee and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the lord hath wrought this in whose hand is the soul of every living thing and the breath of all mankind doth not the ear try words and the mouth taste his meat with the ancient is wisdom and in length of days understanding with him is wisdom and strength he hath counsel and understanding behold he breaketh down and it cannot be built again he shutteth up a man and there can be no opening behold he withholdeth the waters and they dry up also he sendeth them out and they overturn the earth with him is strength and wisdom the deceived and the deceiver are his he leadeth counsellors away spoiled and maketh the judges fools he looseth the bond of kings and girdeth their loins with a girdle he leadeth princes away spoiled and overthroweth the mighty he removeth away the speech of the trusty and taketh away the understanding of the aged he poureth contempt upon princes and weakeneth the strength of the mighty he discovereth deep things out of darkness and bringeth out to light the shadow of death he increaseth the nations and destroyeth them he enlargeth the nations and straiteneth them again he taketh away the heart of the chief of
