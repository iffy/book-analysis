same things unto them forbearing threatening knowing that your master also is in heaven neither is there respect of persons with him finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armour of god that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour of god that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins girt about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints and for me that utterance may be given unto me that i may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel for which i am an ambassador in bonds that therein i may speak boldly as i ought to speak but that ye also may know my affairs and how i do tychicus a beloved brother and faithful minister in the lord shall make known to you all things whom i have sent unto you for the same purpose that ye might know our affairs and that he might comfort your hearts peace be to the brethren and love with faith from god the father and the lord jesus christ grace be with all them that love our lord jesus christ in sincerity amen the epistle of paul the apostle to the philippians paul and timotheus the servants of jesus christ to all the saints in christ jesus which are at philippi with the bishops and deacons grace be unto you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ i thank my god upon every remembrance of you always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ even as it is meet for me to think this of you all because i have you in my heart inasmuch as both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel ye all are partakers of my grace for god is my record how greatly i long after you all in the bowels of jesus christ and this i pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment that ye may approve things that are excellent that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of christ being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by jesus christ unto the glory and praise of god but i would ye should understand brethren that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel so that my bonds in christ are manifest in all the palace and in all other places and many of the brethren in the lord waxing confident by my bonds are much more bold to speak the word without fear some indeed preach christ even of envy and strife and some also of good will the one preach christ of contention not sincerely supposing to add affliction to my bonds but the other of love knowing that i am set for the defence of the gospel what then notwithstanding every way whether in pretence or in truth christ is preached and i therein do rejoice yea and will rejoice for i know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer and the supply of the spirit of jesus christ according to my earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing i shall be ashamed but that with all boldness as always so now also christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death for to me to live is christ and to die is gain but if i live in the flesh this is the fruit of my labour yet what i shall choose i wot not for i am in a strait betwixt two having a desire to depart and to be with christ which is far better nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you and having this confidence i know that i shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith that your rejoicing may be more abundant in jesus christ for me by my coming to you again only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of christ that whether i come and see you or else be absent i may hear of your affairs that ye stand fast in one spirit with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel and in nothing terrified by your adversaries which is to them an evident token of perdition but to you of salvation and that of god for unto you it is given in the behalf of christ not only to believe on him but also to suffer for his sake having the same conflict which ye saw in me and now hear to be in me if there be therefore any consolation in christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the spirit if any bowels and mercies fulfil ye my joy that ye be likeminded having the same love being of one accord of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought
