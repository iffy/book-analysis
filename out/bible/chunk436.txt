forth a remnant and they that escape out of mount zion the zeal of the lord of hosts shall do this therefore thus saith the lord concerning the king of assyria he shall not come into this city nor shoot an arrow there nor come before it with shields nor cast a bank against it by the way that he came by the same shall he return and shall not come into this city saith the lord for i will defend this city to save it for mine own sake and for my servant davids sake then the angel of the lord went forth and smote in the camp of the assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand and when they arose early in the morning behold they were all dead corpses so sennacherib king of assyria departed and went and returned and dwelt at nineveh and it came to pass as he was worshipping in the house of nisroch his god that adrammelech and sharezer his sons smote him with the sword and they escaped into the land of armenia and esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead in those days was hezekiah sick unto death and isaiah the prophet the son of amoz came unto him and said unto him thus saith the lord set thine house in order for thou shalt die and not live then hezekiah turned his face toward the wall and prayed unto the lord and said remember now o lord i beseech thee how i have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and hezekiah wept sore then came the word of the lord to isaiah saying go and say to hezekiah thus saith the lord the god of david thy father i have heard thy prayer i have seen thy tears behold i will add unto thy days fifteen years and i will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of assyria and i will defend this city and this shall be a sign unto thee from the lord that the lord will do this thing that he hath spoken behold i will bring again the shadow of the degrees which is gone down in the sun dial of ahaz ten degrees backward so the sun returned ten degrees by which degrees it was gone down the writing of hezekiah king of judah when he had been sick and was recovered of his sickness i said in the cutting off of my days i shall go to the gates of the grave i am deprived of the residue of my years i said i shall not see the lord even the lord in the land of the living i shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world mine age is departed and is removed from me as a shepherds tent i have cut off like a weaver my life he will cut me off with pining sickness from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me i reckoned till morning that as a lion so will he break all my bones from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me like a crane or a swallow so did i chatter i did mourn as a dove mine eyes fail with looking upward o lord i am oppressed undertake for me what shall i say he hath both spoken unto me and himself hath done it i shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul o lord by these things men live and in all these things is the life of my spirit so wilt thou recover me and make me to live behold for peace i had great bitterness but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back for the grave cannot praise thee death can not celebrate thee they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth the living the living he shall praise thee as i do this day the father to the children shall make known thy truth the lord was ready to save me therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the lord for isaiah had said let them take a lump of figs and lay it for a plaister upon the boil and he shall recover hezekiah also had said what is the sign that i shall go up to the house of the lord at that time merodachbaladan the son of baladan king of babylon sent letters and a present to hezekiah for he had heard that he had been sick and was recovered and hezekiah was glad of them and shewed them the house of his precious things the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious ointment and all the house of his armour and all that was found in his treasures there was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that hezekiah shewed them not then came isaiah the prophet unto king hezekiah and said unto him what said these men and from whence came they unto thee and hezekiah said they are come from a far country unto me even from babylon then said he what have they seen in thine house and hezekiah answered all that is in mine house have they seen there is nothing among my treasures that i have not shewed them then said isaiah to hezekiah hear the word of the lord of hosts behold the days come that all that is in thine house and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day shall be carried to babylon nothing shall be left saith the lord and of thy sons that shall issue from thee which thou shalt beget shall they take away and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of babylon then said hezekiah to isaiah good is the word of the lord which thou hast spoken he said moreover for there shall be peace and truth in my days comfort ye comfort ye my people saith your god speak ye comfortably to jerusalem and cry unto her
