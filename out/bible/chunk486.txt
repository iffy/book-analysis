even unto horonaim as an heifer of three years old for the waters also of nimrim shall be desolate moreover i will cause to cease in moab saith the lord him that offereth in the high places and him that burneth incense to his gods therefore mine heart shall sound for moab like pipes and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of kirheres because the riches that he hath gotten are perished for every head shall be bald and every beard clipped upon all the hands shall be cuttings and upon the loins sackcloth there shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of moab and in the streets thereof for i have broken moab like a vessel wherein is no pleasure saith the lord they shall howl saying how is it broken down how hath moab turned the back with shame so shall moab be a derision and a dismaying to all them about him for thus saith the lord behold he shall fly as an eagle and shall spread his wings over moab kerioth is taken and the strong holds are surprised and the mighty mens hearts in moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs and moab shall be destroyed from being a people because he hath magnified himself against the lord fear and the pit and the snare shall be upon thee o inhabitant of moab saith the lord he that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare for i will bring upon it even upon moab the year of their visitation saith the lord they that fled stood under the shadow of heshbon because of the force but a fire shall come forth out of heshbon and a flame from the midst of sihon and shall devour the corner of moab and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones woe be unto thee o moab the people of chemosh perisheth for thy sons are taken captives and thy daughters captives yet will i bring again the captivity of moab in the latter days saith the lord thus far is the judgment of moab concerning the ammonites thus saith the lord hath israel no sons hath he no heir why then doth their king inherit gad and his people dwell in his cities therefore behold the days come saith the lord that i will cause an alarm of war to be heard in rabbah of the ammonites and it shall be a desolate heap and her daughters shall be burned with fire then shall israel be heir unto them that were his heirs saith the lord howl o heshbon for ai is spoiled cry ye daughters of rabbah gird you with sackcloth lament and run to and fro by the hedges for their king shall go into captivity and his priests and his princes together wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys thy flowing valley o backsliding daughter that trusted in her treasures saying who shall come unto me behold i will bring a fear upon thee saith the lord god of hosts from all those that be about thee and ye shall be driven out every man right forth and none shall gather up him that wandereth and afterward i will bring again the captivity of the children of ammon saith the lord concerning edom thus saith the lord of hosts is wisdom no more in teman is counsel perished from the prudent is their wisdom vanished flee ye turn back dwell deep o inhabitants of dedan for i will bring the calamity of esau upon him the time that i will visit him if grapegatherers come to thee would they not leave some gleaning grapes if thieves by night they will destroy till they have enough but i have made esau bare i have uncovered his secret places and he shall not be able to hide himself his seed is spoiled and his brethren and his neighbours and he is not leave thy fatherless children i will preserve them alive and let thy widows trust in me for thus saith the lord behold they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished thou shalt not go unpunished but thou shalt surely drink of it for i have sworn by myself saith the lord that bozrah shall become a desolation a reproach a waste and a curse and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes i have heard a rumour from the lord and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen saying gather ye together and come against her and rise up to the battle for lo i will make thee small among the heathen and despised among men thy terribleness hath deceived thee and the pride of thine heart o thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock that holdest the height of the hill though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle i will bring thee down from thence saith the lord also edom shall be a desolation every one that goeth by it shall be astonished and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof as in the overthrow of sodom and gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof saith the lord no man shall abide there neither shall a son of man dwell in it behold he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of jordan against the habitation of the strong but i will suddenly make him run away from her and who is a chosen man that i may appoint over her for who is like me and who will appoint me the time and who is that shepherd that will stand before me therefore hear the counsel of the lord that he hath taken against edom and his purposes that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of teman surely the least of the flock shall draw them out surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them the earth is moved at the noise of their fall at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the red sea behold he shall come up and fly as the eagle and spread his wings over bozrah and at that day shall
