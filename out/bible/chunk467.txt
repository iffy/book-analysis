of the wilderness are dried up and their course is evil and their force is not right for both prophet and priest are profane yea in my house have i found their wickedness saith the lord wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the darkness they shall be driven on and fall therein for i will bring evil upon them even the year of their visitation saith the lord and i have seen folly in the prophets of samaria they prophesied in baal and caused my people israel to err i have seen also in the prophets of jerusalem an horrible thing they commit adultery and walk in lies they strengthen also the hands of evildoers that none doth return from his wickedness they are all of them unto me as sodom and the inhabitants thereof as gomorrah therefore thus saith the lord of hosts concerning the prophets behold i will feed them with wormwood and make them drink the water of gall for from the prophets of jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land thus saith the lord of hosts hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you they make you vain they speak a vision of their own heart and not out of the mouth of the lord they say still unto them that despise me the lord hath said ye shall have peace and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart no evil shall come upon you for who hath stood in the counsel of the lord and hath perceived and heard his word who hath marked his word and heard it behold a whirlwind of the lord is gone forth in fury even a grievous whirlwind it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked the anger of the lord shall not return until he have executed and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly i have not sent these prophets yet they ran i have not spoken to them yet they prophesied but if they had stood in my counsel and had caused my people to hear my words then they should have turned them from their evil way and from the evil of their doings am i a god at hand saith the lord and not a god afar off can any hide himself in secret places that i shall not see him saith the lord do not i fill heaven and earth saith the lord i have heard what the prophets said that prophesy lies in my name saying i have dreamed i have dreamed how long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies yea they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour as their fathers have forgotten my name for baal the prophet that hath a dream let him tell a dream and he that hath my word let him speak my word faithfully what is the chaff to the wheat saith the lord is not my word like as a fire saith the lord and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces therefore behold i am against the prophets saith the lord that steal my words every one from his neighbour behold i am against the prophets saith the lord that use their tongues and say he saith behold i am against them that prophesy false dreams saith the lord and do tell them and cause my people to err by their lies and by their lightness yet i sent them not nor commanded them therefore they shall not profit this people at all saith the lord and when this people or the prophet or a priest shall ask thee saying what is the burden of the lord thou shalt then say unto them what burden i will even forsake you saith the lord and as for the prophet and the priest and the people that shall say the burden of the lord i will even punish that man and his house thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour and every one to his brother what hath the lord answered and what hath the lord spoken and the burden of the lord shall ye mention no more for every mans word shall be his burden for ye have perverted the words of the living god of the lord of hosts our god thus shalt thou say to the prophet what hath the lord answered thee and what hath the lord spoken but since ye say the burden of the lord therefore thus saith the lord because ye say this word the burden of the lord and i have sent unto you saying ye shall not say the burden of the lord therefore behold i even i will utterly forget you and i will forsake you and the city that i gave you and your fathers and cast you out of my presence and i will bring an everlasting reproach upon you and a perpetual shame which shall not be forgotten the lord shewed me and behold two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the lord after that nebuchadrezzar king of babylon had carried away captive jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah and the princes of judah with the carpenters and smiths from jerusalem and had brought them to babylon one basket had very good figs even like the figs that are first ripe and the other basket had very naughty figs which could not be eaten they were so bad then said the lord unto me what seest thou jeremiah and i said figs the good figs very good and the evil very evil that cannot be eaten they are so evil again the word of the lord came unto me saying thus saith the lord the god of israel like these good figs so will i acknowledge them that are carried away captive of judah whom i have sent out of this place into the land of the chaldeans for their good for i will set mine eyes upon them for good and i will bring them again to this land and
