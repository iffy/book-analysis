opened and the son of man standing on the right hand of god then they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and ran upon him with one accord and cast him out of the city and stoned him and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young mans feet whose name was saul and they stoned stephen calling upon god and saying lord jesus receive my spirit and he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice lord lay not this sin to their charge and when he had said this he fell asleep and saul was consenting unto his death and at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at jerusalem and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of judaea and samaria except the apostles and devout men carried stephen to his burial and made great lamentation over him as for saul he made havock of the church entering into every house and haling men and women committed them to prison therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word then philip went down to the city of samaria and preached christ unto them and the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which philip spake hearing and seeing the miracles which he did for unclean spirits crying with loud voice came out of many that were possessed with them and many taken with palsies and that were lame were healed and there was great joy in that city but there was a certain man called simon which beforetime in the same city used sorcery and bewitched the people of samaria giving out that himself was some great one to whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest saying this man is the great power of god and to him they had regard because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries but when they believed philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ they were baptized both men and women then simon himself believed also and when he was baptized he continued with philip and wondered beholding the miracles and signs which were done now when the apostles which were at jerusalem heard that samaria had received the word of god they sent unto them peter and john who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the holy ghost for as yet he was fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus then laid they their hands on them and they received the holy ghost and when simon saw that through laying on of the apostles hands the holy ghost was given he offered them money saying give me also this power that on whomsoever i lay hands he may receive the holy ghost but peter said unto him thy money perish with thee because thou hast thought that the gift of god may be purchased with money thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter for thy heart is not right in the sight of god repent therefore of this thy wickedness and pray god if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee for i perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity then answered simon and said pray ye to the lord for me that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me and they when they had testified and preached the word of the lord returned to jerusalem and preached the gospel in many villages of the samaritans and the angel of the lord spake unto philip saying arise and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from jerusalem unto gaza which is desert and he arose and went and behold a man of ethiopia an eunuch of great authority under candace queen of the ethiopians who had the charge of all her treasure and had come to jerusalem for to worship was returning and sitting in his chariot read esaias the prophet then the spirit said unto philip go near and join thyself to this chariot and philip ran thither to him and heard him read the prophet esaias and said understandest thou what thou readest and he said how can i except some man should guide me and he desired philip that he would come up and sit with him the place of the scripture which he read was this he was led as a sheep to the slaughter and like a lamb dumb before his shearer so opened he not his mouth in his humiliation his judgment was taken away and who shall declare his generation for his life is taken from the earth and the eunuch answered philip and said i pray thee of whom speaketh the prophet this of himself or of some other man then philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture and preached unto him jesus and as they went on their way they came unto a certain water and the eunuch said see here is water what doth hinder me to be baptized and philip said if thou believest with all thine heart thou mayest and he answered and said i believe that jesus christ is the son of god and he commanded the chariot to stand still and they went down both into the water both philip and the eunuch and he baptized him and when they were come up out of the water the spirit of the lord caught away philip that the eunuch saw him no more and he went on his way rejoicing but philip was found at azotus and passing through he preached in all the cities till he came to caesarea and saul yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the lord went unto the high priest and desired of him letters to damascus to the synagogues that if he found any of this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound unto jerusalem and as he journeyed he came near damascus and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven and he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto him saul saul why persecutest
