became a serpent and moses fled from before it and the lord said unto moses put forth thine hand and take it by the tail and he put forth his hand and caught it and it became a rod in his hand that they may believe that the lord god of their fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob hath appeared unto thee and the lord said furthermore unto him put now thine hand into thy bosom and he put his hand into his bosom and when he took it out behold his hand was leprous as snow and he said put thine hand into thy bosom again and he put his hand into his bosom again and plucked it out of his bosom and behold it was turned again as his other flesh and it shall come to pass if they will not believe thee neither hearken to the voice of the first sign that they will believe the voice of the latter sign and it shall come to pass if they will not believe also these two signs neither hearken unto thy voice that thou shalt take of the water of the river and pour it upon the dry land and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land and moses said unto the lord o my lord i am not eloquent neither heretofore nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant but i am slow of speech and of a slow tongue and the lord said unto him who hath made mans mouth or who maketh the dumb or deaf or the seeing or the blind have not i the lord now therefore go and i will be with thy mouth and teach thee what thou shalt say and he said o my lord send i pray thee by the hand of him whom thou wilt send and the anger of the lord was kindled against moses and he said is not aaron the levite thy brother i know that he can speak well and also behold he cometh forth to meet thee and when he seeth thee he will be glad in his heart and thou shalt speak unto him and put words in his mouth and i will be with thy mouth and with his mouth and will teach you what ye shall do and he shall be thy spokesman unto the people and he shall be even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth and thou shalt be to him instead of god and thou shalt take this rod in thine hand wherewith thou shalt do signs and moses went and returned to jethro his father in law and said unto him let me go i pray thee and return unto my brethren which are in egypt and see whether they be yet alive and jethro said to moses go in peace and the lord said unto moses in midian go return into egypt for all the men are dead which sought thy life and moses took his wife and his sons and set them upon an ass and he returned to the land of egypt and moses took the rod of god in his hand and the lord said unto moses when thou goest to return into egypt see that thou do all those wonders before pharaoh which i have put in thine hand but i will harden his heart that he shall not let the people go and thou shalt say unto pharaoh thus saith the lord israel is my son even my firstborn and i say unto thee let my son go that he may serve me and if thou refuse to let him go behold i will slay thy son even thy firstborn and it came to pass by the way in the inn that the lord met him and sought to kill him then zipporah took a sharp stone and cut off the foreskin of her son and cast it at his feet and said surely a bloody husband art thou to me so he let him go then she said a bloody husband thou art because of the circumcision and the lord said to aaron go into the wilderness to meet moses and he went and met him in the mount of god and kissed him and moses told aaron all the words of the lord who had sent him and all the signs which he had commanded him and moses and aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of israel and aaron spake all the words which the lord had spoken unto moses and did the signs in the sight of the people and the people believed and when they heard that the lord had visited the children of israel and that he had looked upon their affliction then they bowed their heads and worshipped and afterward moses and aaron went in and told pharaoh thus saith the lord god of israel let my people go that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness and pharaoh said who is the lord that i should obey his voice to let israel go i know not the lord neither will i let israel go and they said the god of the hebrews hath met with us let us go we pray thee three days journey into the desert and sacrifice unto the lord our god lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword and the king of egypt said unto them wherefore do ye moses and aaron let the people from their works get you unto your burdens and pharaoh said behold the people of the land now are many and ye make them rest from their burdens and pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people and their officers saying ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick as heretofore let them go and gather straw for themselves and the tale of the bricks which they did make heretofore ye shall lay upon them ye shall not diminish ought thereof for they be idle therefore they cry saying let us go and sacrifice to our god let there more work be laid upon the men that they may labour therein and let them not regard
