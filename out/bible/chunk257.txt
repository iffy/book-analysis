left the land even until now and elisha came to damascus and benhadad the king of syria was sick and it was told him saying the man of god is come hither and the king said unto hazael take a present in thine hand and go meet the man of god and enquire of the lord by him saying shall i recover of this disease so hazael went to meet him and took a present with him even of every good thing of damascus forty camels burden and came and stood before him and said thy son benhadad king of syria hath sent me to thee saying shall i recover of this disease and elisha said unto him go say unto him thou mayest certainly recover howbeit the lord hath shewed me that he shall surely die and he settled his countenance stedfastly until he was ashamed and the man of god wept and hazael said why weepeth my lord and he answered because i know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of israel their strong holds wilt thou set on fire and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword and wilt dash their children and rip up their women with child and hazael said but what is thy servant a dog that he should do this great thing and elisha answered the lord hath shewed me that thou shalt be king over syria so he departed from elisha and came to his master who said to him what said elisha to thee and he answered he told me that thou shouldest surely recover and it came to pass on the morrow that he took a thick cloth and dipped it in water and spread it on his face so that he died and hazael reigned in his stead and in the fifth year of joram the son of ahab king of israel jehoshaphat being then king of judah jehoram the son of jehoshaphat king of judah began to reign thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned eight years in jerusalem and he walked in the way of the kings of israel as did the house of ahab for the daughter of ahab was his wife and he did evil in the sight of the lord yet the lord would not destroy judah for david his servants sake as he promised him to give him alway a light and to his children in his days edom revolted from under the hand of judah and made a king over themselves so joram went over to zair and all the chariots with him and he rose by night and smote the edomites which compassed him about and the captains of the chariots and the people fled into their tents yet edom revolted from under the hand of judah unto this day then libnah revolted at the same time and the rest of the acts of joram and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah and joram slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david and ahaziah his son reigned in his stead in the twelfth year of joram the son of ahab king of israel did ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah begin to reign two and twenty years old was ahaziah when he began to reign and he reigned one year in jerusalem and his mothers name was athaliah the daughter of omri king of israel and he walked in the way of the house of ahab and did evil in the sight of the lord as did the house of ahab for he was the son in law of the house of ahab and he went with joram the son of ahab to the war against hazael king of syria in ramothgilead and the syrians wounded joram and king joram went back to be healed in jezreel of the wounds which the syrians had given him at ramah when he fought against hazael king of syria and ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah went down to see joram the son of ahab in jezreel because he was sick and elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets and said unto him gird up thy loins and take this box of oil in thine hand and go to ramothgilead and when thou comest thither look out there jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi and go in and make him arise up from among his brethren and carry him to an inner chamber then take the box of oil and pour it on his head and say thus saith the lord i have anointed thee king over israel then open the door and flee and tarry not so the young man even the young man the prophet went to ramothgilead and when he came behold the captains of the host were sitting and he said i have an errand to thee o captain and jehu said unto which of all us and he said to thee o captain and he arose and went into the house and he poured the oil on his head and said unto him thus saith the lord god of israel i have anointed thee king over the people of the lord even over israel and thou shalt smite the house of ahab thy master that i may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all the servants of the lord at the hand of jezebel for the whole house of ahab shall perish and i will cut off from ahab him that pisseth against the wall and him that is shut up and left in israel and i will make the house of ahab like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat and like the house of baasha the son of ahijah and the dogs shall eat jezebel in the portion of jezreel and there shall be none to bury her and he opened the door and fled then jehu came forth to the servants of his lord and one said unto him is all well wherefore came this mad fellow to thee and he said unto them ye know the man and his communication and they
