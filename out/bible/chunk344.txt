the heavens are not clean in his sight how much more abominable and filthy is man which drinketh iniquity like water i will shew thee hear me and that which i have seen i will declare which wise men have told from their fathers and have not hid it unto whom alone the earth was given and no stranger passed among them the wicked man travaileth with pain all his days and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor a dreadful sound is in his ears in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him he believeth not that he shall return out of darkness and he is waited for of the sword he wandereth abroad for bread saying where is it he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand trouble and anguish shall make him afraid they shall prevail against him as a king ready to the battle for he stretcheth out his hand against god and strengtheneth himself against the almighty he runneth upon him even on his neck upon the thick bosses of his bucklers because he covereth his face with his fatness and maketh collops of fat on his flanks and he dwelleth in desolate cities and in houses which no man inhabiteth which are ready to become heaps he shall not be rich neither shall his substance continue neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth he shall not depart out of darkness the flame shall dry up his branches and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away let not him that is deceived trust in vanity for vanity shall be his recompence it shall be accomplished before his time and his branch shall not be green he shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine and shall cast off his flower as the olive for the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery they conceive mischief and bring forth vanity and their belly prepareth deceit then job answered and said i have heard many such things miserable comforters are ye all shall vain words have an end or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest i also could speak as ye do if your soul were in my souls stead i could heap up words against you and shake mine head at you but i would strengthen you with my mouth and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief though i speak my grief is not asswaged and though i forbear what am i eased but now he hath made me weary thou hast made desolate all my company and thou hast filled me with wrinkles which is a witness against me and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face he teareth me in his wrath who hateth me he gnasheth upon me with his teeth mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me they have gaped upon me with their mouth they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully they have gathered themselves together against me god hath delivered me to the ungodly and turned me over into the hands of the wicked i was at ease but he hath broken me asunder he hath also taken me by my neck and shaken me to pieces and set me up for his mark his archers compass me round about he cleaveth my reins asunder and doth not spare he poureth out my gall upon the ground he breaketh me with breach upon breach he runneth upon me like a giant i have sewed sackcloth upon my skin and defiled my horn in the dust my face is foul with weeping and on my eyelids is the shadow of death not for any injustice in mine hands also my prayer is pure o earth cover not thou my blood and let my cry have no place also now behold my witness is in heaven and my record is on high my friends scorn me but mine eye poureth out tears unto god o that one might plead for a man with god as a man pleadeth for his neighbour when a few years are come then i shall go the way whence i shall not return my breath is corrupt my days are extinct the graves are ready for me are there not mockers with me and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation lay down now put me in a surety with thee who is he that will strike hands with me for thou hast hid their heart from understanding therefore shalt thou not exalt them he that speaketh flattery to his friends even the eyes of his children shall fail he hath made me also a byword of the people and aforetime i was as a tabret mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow and all my members are as a shadow upright men shall be astonied at this and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite the righteous also shall hold on his way and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger but as for you all do ye return and come now for i cannot find one wise man among you my days are past my purposes are broken off even the thoughts of my heart they change the night into day the light is short because of darkness if i wait the grave is mine house i have made my bed in the darkness i have said to corruption thou art my

answered bildad the shuhite and said how long will it be ere ye make an end of words mark and afterwards we will speak wherefore are we counted as beasts and reputed vile in your sight he teareth himself in his anger shall the earth be forsaken for thee and shall the rock be removed out of his place yea the light of the wicked shall be put out and the spark of his fire shall not shine the light shall be dark in his tabernacle and his candle shall be
