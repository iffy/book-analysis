my strength to fall the lord hath delivered me into their hands from whom i am not able to rise up the lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men the lord hath trodden the virgin the daughter of judah as in a winepress for these things i weep mine eye mine eye runneth down with water because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me my children are desolate because the enemy prevailed zion spreadeth forth her hands and there is none to comfort her the lord hath commanded concerning jacob that his adversaries should be round about him jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them the lord is righteous for i have rebelled against his commandment hear i pray you all people and behold my sorrow my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity i called for my lovers but they deceived me my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city while they sought their meat to relieve their souls behold o lord for i am in distress my bowels are troubled mine heart is turned within me for i have grievously rebelled abroad the sword bereaveth at home there is as death they have heard that i sigh there is none to comfort me all mine enemies have heard of my trouble they are glad that thou hast done it thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called and they shall be like unto me let all their wickedness come before thee and do unto them as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions for my sighs are many and my heart is faint how hath the lord covered the daughter of zion with a cloud in his anger and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of israel and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger the lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of jacob and hath not pitied he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of judah he hath brought them down to the ground he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof he hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of israel he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy and he burned against jacob like a flaming fire which devoureth round about he hath bent his bow like an enemy he stood with his right hand as an adversary and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of zion he poured out his fury like fire the lord was as an enemy he hath swallowed up israel he hath swallowed up all her palaces he hath destroyed his strong holds and hath increased in the daughter of judah mourning and lamentation and he hath violently taken away his tabernacle as if it were of a garden he hath destroyed his places of the assembly the lord hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in zion and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest the lord hath cast off his altar he hath abhorred his sanctuary he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces they have made a noise in the house of the lord as in the day of a solemn feast the lord hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of zion he hath stretched out a line he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament they languished together her gates are sunk into the ground he hath destroyed and broken her bars her king and her princes are among the gentiles the law is no more her prophets also find no vision from the lord the elders of the daughter of zion sit upon the ground and keep silence they have cast up dust upon their heads they have girded themselves with sackcloth the virgins of jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground mine eyes do fail with tears my bowels are troubled my liver is poured upon the earth for the destruction of the daughter of my people because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city they say to their mothers where is corn and wine when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city when their soul was poured out into their mothers bosom what thing shall i take to witness for thee what thing shall i liken to thee o daughter of jerusalem what shall i equal to thee that i may comfort thee o virgin daughter of zion for thy breach is great like the sea who can heal thee thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee and they have not discovered thine iniquity to turn away thy captivity but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment all that pass by clap their hands at thee they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of jerusalem saying is this the city that men call the perfection of beauty the joy of the whole earth all thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee they hiss and gnash the teeth they say we have swallowed her up certainly this is the day that we looked for we have found we have seen it the lord hath done that which he had devised he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old he hath thrown down and hath not pitied and he hath caused thine enemy to rejoice over thee he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries their heart cried unto the lord o wall of the daughter of zion let tears run down like a river day and night give thyself no rest let not the apple of thine eye cease arise cry out in the night in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the lord lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children that faint for hunger in the top of every street
