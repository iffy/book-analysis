thee and it would be sin in thee but if thou shalt forbear to vow it shall be no sin in thee that which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and perform even a freewill offering according as thou hast vowed unto the lord thy god which thou hast promised with thy mouth when thou comest into thy neighbours vineyard then thou mayest eat grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure but thou shalt not put any in thy vessel when thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbour then thou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand but thou shalt not move a sickle unto thy neighbours standing corn when a man hath taken a wife and married her and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes because he hath found some uncleanness in her then let him write her a bill of divorcement and give it in her hand and send her out of his house and when she is departed out of his house she may go and be another mans wife and if the latter husband hate her and write her a bill of divorcement and giveth it in her hand and sendeth her out of his house or if the latter husband die which took her to be his wife her former husband which sent her away may not take her again to be his wife after that she is defiled for that is abomination before the lord and thou shalt not cause the land to sin which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance when a man hath taken a new wife he shall not go out to war neither shall he be charged with any business but he shall be free at home one year and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken no man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge for he taketh a mans life to pledge if a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of israel and maketh merchandise of him or selleth him then that thief shall die and thou shalt put evil away from among you take heed in the plague of leprosy that thou observe diligently and do according to all that the priests the levites shall teach you as i commanded them so ye shall observe to do remember what the lord thy god did unto miriam by the way after that ye were come forth out of egypt when thou dost lend thy brother any thing thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge thou shalt stand abroad and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee and if the man be poor thou shalt not sleep with his pledge in any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down that he may sleep in his own raiment and bless thee and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the lord thy god thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy whether he be of thy brethren or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates at his day thou shalt give him his hire neither shall the sun go down upon it for he is poor and setteth his heart upon it lest he cry against thee unto the lord and it be sin unto thee the fathers shall not be put to death for the children neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers every man shall be put to death for his own sin thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger nor of the fatherless nor take a widows raiment to pledge but thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in egypt and the lord thy god redeemed thee thence therefore i command thee to do this thing when thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field and hast forgot a sheaf in the field thou shalt not go again to fetch it it shall be for the stranger for the fatherless and for the widow that the lord thy god may bless thee in all the work of thine hands when thou beatest thine olive tree thou shalt not go over the boughs again it shall be for the stranger for the fatherless and for the widow when thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard thou shalt not glean it afterward it shall be for the stranger for the fatherless and for the widow and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of egypt therefore i command thee to do this thing if there be a controversy between men and they come unto judgment that the judges may judge them then they shall justify the righteous and condemn the wicked and it shall be if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten that the judge shall cause him to lie down and to be beaten before his face according to his fault by a certain number forty stripes he may give him and not exceed lest if he should exceed and beat him above these with many stripes then thy brother should seem vile unto thee thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn if brethren dwell together and one of them die and have no child the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger her husbands brother shall go in unto her and take her to him to wife and perform the duty of an husbands brother unto her and it shall be that the firstborn which she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead that his name be not put out of israel and if the man like not to take his brothers wife then let his brothers wife go up to the gate unto the elders and say my husbands brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in israel he will not perform the duty of my husbands brother then the elders of his city shall call him and speak unto him and if he stand to it and say i like not to take her then shall his brothers wife come unto him in
