would not cause me to return to jonathans house to die there then came all the princes unto jeremiah and asked him and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded so they left off speaking with him for the matter was not perceived so jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that jerusalem was taken and he was there when jerusalem was taken in the ninth year of zedekiah king of judah in the tenth month came nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and all his army against jerusalem and they besieged it and in the eleventh year of zedekiah in the fourth month the ninth day of the month the city was broken up and all the princes of the king of babylon came in and sat in the middle gate even nergalsharezer samgarnebo sarsechim rabsaris nergalsharezer rabmag with all the residue of the princes of the king of babylon and it came to pass that when zedekiah the king of judah saw them and all the men of war then they fled and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the kings garden by the gate betwixt the two walls and he went out the way of the plain but the chaldeans army pursued after them and overtook zedekiah in the plains of jericho and when they had taken him they brought him up to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon to riblah in the land of hamath where he gave judgment upon him then the king of babylon slew the sons of zedekiah in riblah before his eyes also the king of babylon slew all the nobles of judah moreover he put out zedekiahs eyes and bound him with chains to carry him to babylon and the chaldeans burned the kings house and the houses of the people with fire and brake down the walls of jerusalem then nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city and those that fell away that fell to him with the rest of the people that remained but nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people which had nothing in the land of judah and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time now nebuchadrezzar king of babylon gave charge concerning jeremiah to nebuzaradan the captain of the guard saying take him and look well to him and do him no harm but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee so nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent and nebushasban rabsaris and nergalsharezer rabmag and all the king of babylons princes even they sent and took jeremiah out of the court of the prison and committed him unto gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan that he should carry him home so he dwelt among the people now the word of the lord came unto jeremiah while he was shut up in the court of the prison saying go and speak to ebedmelech the ethiopian saying thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will bring my words upon this city for evil and not for good and they shall be accomplished in that day before thee but i will deliver thee in that day saith the lord and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid for i will surely deliver thee and thou shalt not fall by the sword but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee because thou hast put thy trust in me saith the lord the word that came to jeremiah from the lord after that nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from ramah when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of jerusalem and judah which were carried away captive unto babylon and the captain of the guard took jeremiah and said unto him the lord thy god hath pronounced this evil upon this place now the lord hath brought it and done according as he hath said because ye have sinned against the lord and have not obeyed his voice therefore this thing is come upon you and now behold i loose thee this day from the chains which were upon thine hand if it seem good unto thee to come with me into babylon come and i will look well unto thee but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into babylon forbear behold all the land is before thee whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go thither go now while he was not yet gone back he said go back also to gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan whom the king of babylon hath made governor over the cities of judah and dwell with him among the people or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go so the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward and let him go then went jeremiah unto gedaliah the son of ahikam to mizpah and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields even they and their men heard that the king of babylon had made gedaliah the son of ahikam governor in the land and had committed unto him men and women and children and of the poor of the land of them that were not carried away captive to babylon then they came to gedaliah to mizpah even ishmael the son of nethaniah and johanan and jonathan the sons of kareah and seraiah the son of tanhumeth and the sons of ephai the netophathite and jezaniah the son of a maachathite they and their men and gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan sware unto them and to their men saying fear not to serve the chaldeans dwell in the land and serve the king of babylon and it shall be well with you as for me behold i will dwell at mizpah to serve the chaldeans which will come unto us but ye gather ye wine and summer fruits and oil and put them in your vessels
