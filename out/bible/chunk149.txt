be a sign among you that when your children ask their fathers in time to come saying what mean ye by these stones then ye shall answer them that the waters of jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the lord when it passed over jordan the waters of jordan were cut off and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of israel for ever and the children of israel did so as joshua commanded and took up twelve stones out of the midst of jordan as the lord spake unto joshua according to the number of the tribes of the children of israel and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged and laid them down there and joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of jordan in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood and they are there unto this day for the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of jordan until everything was finished that the lord commanded joshua to speak unto the people according to all that moses commanded joshua and the people hasted and passed over and it came to pass when all the people were clean passed over that the ark of the lord passed over and the priests in the presence of the people and the children of reuben and the children of gad and half the tribe of manasseh passed over armed before the children of israel as moses spake unto them about forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the lord unto battle to the plains of jericho on that day the lord magnified joshua in the sight of all israel and they feared him as they feared moses all the days of his life and the lord spake unto joshua saying command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony that they come up out of jordan joshua therefore commanded the priests saying come ye up out of jordan and it came to pass when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the lord were come up out of the midst of jordan and the soles of the priests feet were lifted up unto the dry land that the waters of jordan returned unto their place and flowed over all his banks as they did before and the people came up out of jordan on the tenth day of the first month and encamped in gilgal in the east border of jericho and those twelve stones which they took out of jordan did joshua pitch in gilgal and he spake unto the children of israel saying when your children shall ask their fathers in time to come saying what mean these stones then ye shall let your children know saying israel came over this jordan on dry land for the lord your god dried up the waters of jordan from before you until ye were passed over as the lord your god did to the red sea which he dried up from before us until we were gone over that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the lord that it is mighty that ye might fear the lord your god for ever and it came to pass when all the kings of the amorites which were on the side of jordan westward and all the kings of the canaanites which were by the sea heard that the lord had dried up the waters of jordan from before the children of israel until we were passed over that their heart melted neither was there spirit in them any more because of the children of israel at that time the lord said unto joshua make thee sharp knives and circumcise again the children of israel the second time and joshua made him sharp knives and circumcised the children of israel at the hill of the foreskins and this is the cause why joshua did circumcise all the people that came out of egypt that were males even all the men of war died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of egypt now all the people that came out were circumcised but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of egypt them they had not circumcised for the children of israel walked forty years in the wilderness till all the people that were men of war which came out of egypt were consumed because they obeyed not the voice of the lord unto whom the lord sware that he would not shew them the land which the lord sware unto their fathers that he would give us a land that floweth with milk and honey and their children whom he raised up in their stead them joshua circumcised for they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them by the way and it came to pass when they had done circumcising all the people that they abode in their places in the camp till they were whole and the lord said unto joshua this day have i rolled away the reproach of egypt from off you wherefore the name of the place is called gilgal unto this day and the children of israel encamped in gilgal and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of jericho and they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover unleavened cakes and parched corn in the selfsame day and the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land neither had the children of israel manna any more but they did eat of the fruit of the land of canaan that year and it came to pass when joshua was by jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand and joshua went unto him and said unto him art thou for us or for our adversaries and he said nay but as captain of the host of the lord am i now come and joshua fell on his face to the earth and did worship and said unto
