great abundance and so shall be the plague of the horse of the mule of the camel and of the ass and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents as this plague and it shall come to pass that every one that is left of all the nations which came against jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the king the lord of hosts and to keep the feast of tabernacles and it shall be that whoso will not come up of all the families of the earth unto jerusalem to worship the king the lord of hosts even upon them shall be no rain and if the family of egypt go not up and come not that have no rain there shall be the plague wherewith the lord will smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles this shall be the punishment of egypt and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles in that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses holiness unto the lord and the pots in the lords house shall be like the bowls before the altar yea every pot in jerusalem and in judah shall be holiness unto the lord of hosts and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them and seethe therein and in that day there shall be no more the canaanite in the house of the lord of hosts malachi the burden of the word of the lord to israel by malachi i have loved you saith the lord yet ye say wherein hast thou loved us was not esau jacobs brother saith the lord yet i loved jacob and i hated esau and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness whereas edom saith we are impoverished but we will return and build the desolate places thus saith the lord of hosts they shall build but i will throw down and they shall call them the border of wickedness and the people against whom the lord hath indignation for ever and your eyes shall see and ye shall say the lord will be magnified from the border of israel a son honoureth his father and a servant his master if then i be a father where is mine honour and if i be a master where is my fear saith the lord of hosts unto you o priests that despise my name and ye say wherein have we despised thy name ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar and ye say wherein have we polluted thee in that ye say the table of the lord is contemptible and if ye offer the blind for sacrifice is it not evil and if ye offer the lame and sick is it not evil offer it now unto thy governor will he be pleased with thee or accept thy person saith the lord of hosts and now i pray you beseech god that he will be gracious unto us this hath been by your means will he regard your persons saith the lord of hosts who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought i have no pleasure in you saith the lord of hosts neither will i accept an offering at your hand for from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the gentiles and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name and a pure offering for my name shall be great among the heathen saith the lord of hosts but ye have profaned it in that ye say the table of the lord is polluted and the fruit thereof even his meat is contemptible ye said also behold what a weariness is it and ye have snuffed at it saith the lord of hosts and ye brought that which was torn and the lame and the sick thus ye brought an offering should i accept this of your hand saith the lord but cursed be the deceiver which hath in his flock a male and voweth and sacrificeth unto the lord a corrupt thing for i am a great king saith the lord of hosts and my name is dreadful among the heathen and now o ye priests this commandment is for you if ye will not hear and if ye will not lay it to heart to give glory unto my name saith the lord of hosts i will even send a curse upon you and i will curse your blessings yea i have cursed them already because ye do not lay it to heart behold i will corrupt your seed and spread dung upon your faces even the dung of your solemn feasts and one shall take you away with it and ye shall know that i have sent this commandment unto you that my covenant might be with levi saith the lord of hosts my covenant was with him of life and peace and i gave them to him for the fear wherewith he feared me and was afraid before my name the law of truth was in his mouth and iniquity was not found in his lips he walked with me in peace and equity and did turn many away from iniquity for the priests lips should keep knowledge and they should seek the law at his mouth for he is the messenger of the lord of hosts but ye are departed out of the way ye have caused many to stumble at the law ye have corrupted the covenant of levi saith the lord of hosts therefore have i also made you contemptible and base before all the people according as ye have not kept my ways but have been partial in the law have we not all one father hath not one god created us why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother by profaning the covenant of our fathers judah hath dealt treacherously and an abomination is committed in israel and in jerusalem for judah hath profaned the holiness of the lord which he loved and hath married the daughter of a strange god the lord will cut off the man
