revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass but as for me this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that i have more than any living but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart thou o king sawest and behold a great image this great image whose brightness was excellent stood before thee and the form thereof was terrible this images head was of fine gold his breast and his arms of silver his belly and his thighs of brass his legs of iron his feet part of iron and part of clay thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and brake them to pieces then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broken to pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth this is the dream and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king thou o king art a king of kings for the god of heaven hath given thee a kingdom power and strength and glory and wheresoever the children of men dwell the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand and hath made thee ruler over them all thou art this head of gold and after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee and another third kingdom of brass which shall bear rule over all the earth and the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things and as iron that breaketh all these shall it break in pieces and bruise and whereas thou sawest the feet and toes part of potters clay and part of iron the kingdom shall be divided but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay and as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken and whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men but they shall not cleave one to another even as iron is not mixed with clay and in the days of these kings shall the god of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand for ever forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it brake in pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver and the gold the great god hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter and the dream is certain and the interpretation thereof sure then the king nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and worshipped daniel and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him the king answered unto daniel and said of a truth it is that your god is a god of gods and a lord of kings and a revealer of secrets seeing thou couldest reveal this secret then the king made daniel a great man and gave him many great gifts and made him ruler over the whole province of babylon and chief of the governors over all the wise men of babylon then daniel requested of the king and he set shadrach meshach and abednego over the affairs of the province of babylon but daniel sat in the gate of the king nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold whose height was threescore cubits and the breadth thereof six cubits he set it up in the plain of dura in the province of babylon then nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes the governors and the captains the judges the treasurers the counsellors the sheriffs and all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image which nebuchadnezzar the king had set up then the princes the governors and captains the judges the treasurers the counsellors the sheriffs and all the rulers of the provinces were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that nebuchadnezzar the king had set up and they stood before the image that nebuchadnezzar had set up then an herald cried aloud to you it is commanded o people nations and languages that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery dulcimer and all kinds of musick ye fall down and worship the golden image that nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace therefore at that time when all the people heard the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery and all kinds of musick all the people the nations and the languages fell down and worshipped the golden image that nebuchadnezzar the king had set up wherefore at that time certain chaldeans came near and accused the jews they spake and said to the king nebuchadnezzar o king live for ever thou o king hast made a decree that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery and dulcimer and all kinds of musick shall fall down and worship the golden image and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace there are certain jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of babylon shadrach meshach and abednego these men o king have not regarded thee they serve not thy gods nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up then nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring shadrach meshach and abednego then they brought these men before the king nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them is it true o shadrach meshach and abednego
