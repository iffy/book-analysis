and dwell in your cities that ye have taken likewise when all the jews that were in moab and among the ammonites and in edom and that were in all the countries heard that the king of babylon had left a remnant of judah and that he had set over them gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan even all the jews returned out of all places whither they were driven and came to the land of judah to gedaliah unto mizpah and gathered wine and summer fruits very much moreover johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields came to gedaliah to mizpah and said unto him dost thou certainly know that baalis the king of the ammonites hath sent ishmael the son of nethaniah to slay thee but gedaliah the son of ahikam believed them not then johanan the son of kareah spake to gedaliah in mizpah secretly saying let me go i pray thee and i will slay ishmael the son of nethaniah and no man shall know it wherefore should he slay thee that all the jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered and the remnant in judah perish but gedaliah the son of ahikam said unto johanan the son of kareah thou shalt not do this thing for thou speakest falsely of ishmael now it came to pass in the seventh month that ishmael the son of nethaniah the son of elishama of the seed royal and the princes of the king even ten men with him came unto gedaliah the son of ahikam to mizpah and there they did eat bread together in mizpah then arose ishmael the son of nethaniah and the ten men that were with him and smote gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan with the sword and slew him whom the king of babylon had made governor over the land ishmael also slew all the jews that were with him even with gedaliah at mizpah and the chaldeans that were found there and the men of war and it came to pass the second day after he had slain gedaliah and no man knew it that there came certain from shechem from shiloh and from samaria even fourscore men having their beards shaven and their clothes rent and having cut themselves with offerings and incense in their hand to bring them to the house of the lord and ishmael the son of nethaniah went forth from mizpah to meet them weeping all along as he went and it came to pass as he met them he said unto them come to gedaliah the son of ahikam and it was so when they came into the midst of the city that ishmael the son of nethaniah slew them and cast them into the midst of the pit he and the men that were with him but ten men were found among them that said unto ishmael slay us not for we have treasures in the field of wheat and of barley and of oil and of honey so he forbare and slew them not among their brethren now the pit wherein ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain because of gedaliah was it which asa the king had made for fear of baasha king of israel and ishmael the son of nethaniah filled it with them that were slain then ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in mizpah even the kings daughters and all the people that remained in mizpah whom nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to gedaliah the son of ahikam and ishmael the son of nethaniah carried them away captive and departed to go over to the ammonites but when johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him heard of all the evil that ishmael the son of nethaniah had done then they took all the men and went to fight with ishmael the son of nethaniah and found him by the great waters that are in gibeon now it came to pass that when all the people which were with ishmael saw johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him then they were glad so all the people that ishmael had carried away captive from mizpah cast about and returned and went unto johanan the son of kareah but ishmael the son of nethaniah escaped from johanan with eight men and went to the ammonites then took johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from ishmael the son of nethaniah from mizpah after that he had slain gedaliah the son of ahikam even mighty men of war and the women and the children and the eunuchs whom he had brought again from gibeon and they departed and dwelt in the habitation of chimham which is by bethlehem to go to enter into egypt because of the chaldeans for they were afraid of them because ishmael the son of nethaniah had slain gedaliah the son of ahikam whom the king of babylon made governor in the land then all the captains of the forces and johanan the son of kareah and jezaniah the son of hoshaiah and all the people from the least even unto the greatest came near and said unto jeremiah the prophet let we beseech thee our supplication be accepted before thee and pray for us unto the lord thy god even for all this remnant for we are left but a few of many as thine eyes do behold us that the lord thy god may shew us the way wherein we may walk and the thing that we may do then jeremiah the prophet said unto them i have heard you behold i will pray unto the lord your god according to your words and it shall come to pass that whatsoever thing the lord shall answer you i will declare it unto you i will keep nothing back from you then they said to jeremiah the lord be a true and faithful witness between us if we do not even according to all things
