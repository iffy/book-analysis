from thence and thou shalt come to the plain of tabor and there shall meet thee three men going up to god to bethel one carrying three kids and another carrying three loaves of bread and another carrying a bottle of wine and they will salute thee and give thee two loaves of bread which thou shalt receive of their hands after that thou shalt come to the hill of god where is the garrison of the philistines and it shall come to pass when thou art come thither to the city that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery and a tabret and a pipe and a harp before them and they shall prophesy and the spirit of the lord will come upon thee and thou shalt prophesy with them and shalt be turned into another man and let it be when these signs are come unto thee that thou do as occasion serve thee for god is with thee and thou shalt go down before me to gilgal and behold i will come down unto thee to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings seven days shalt thou tarry till i come to thee and shew thee what thou shalt do and it was so that when he had turned his back to go from samuel god gave him another heart and all those signs came to pass that day and when they came thither to the hill behold a company of prophets met him and the spirit of god came upon him and he prophesied among them and it came to pass when all that knew him beforetime saw that behold he prophesied among the prophets then the people said one to another what is this that is come unto the son of kish is saul also among the prophets and one of the same place answered and said but who is their father therefore it became a proverb is saul also among the prophets and when he had made an end of prophesying he came to the high place and sauls uncle said unto him and to his servant whither went ye and he said to seek the asses and when we saw that they were no where we came to samuel and sauls uncle said tell me i pray thee what samuel said unto you and saul said unto his uncle he told us plainly that the asses were found but of the matter of the kingdom whereof samuel spake he told him not and samuel called the people together unto the lord to mizpeh and said unto the children of israel thus saith the lord god of israel i brought up israel out of egypt and delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of all kingdoms and of them that oppressed you and ye have this day rejected your god who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations and ye have said unto him nay but set a king over us now therefore present yourselves before the lord by your tribes and by your thousands and when samuel had caused all the tribes of israel to come near the tribe of benjamin was taken when he had caused the tribe of benjamin to come near by their families the family of matri was taken and saul the son of kish was taken and when they sought him he could not be found therefore they enquired of the lord further if the man should yet come thither and the lord answered behold he hath hid himself among the stuff and they ran and fetched him thence and when he stood among the people he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward and samuel said to all the people see ye him whom the lord hath chosen that there is none like him among all the people and all the people shouted and said god save the king then samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom and wrote it in a book and laid it up before the lord and samuel sent all the people away every man to his house and saul also went home to gibeah and there went with him a band of men whose hearts god had touched but the children of belial said how shall this man save us and they despised him and brought no presents but he held his peace then nahash the ammonite came up and encamped against jabeshgilead and all the men of jabesh said unto nahash make a covenant with us and we will serve thee and nahash the ammonite answered them on this condition will i make a covenant with you that i may thrust out all your right eyes and lay it for a reproach upon all israel and the elders of jabesh said unto him give us seven days respite that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of israel and then if there be no man to save us we will come out to thee then came the messengers to gibeah of saul and told the tidings in the ears of the people and all the people lifted up their voices and wept and behold saul came after the herd out of the field and saul said what aileth the people that they weep and they told him the tidings of the men of jabesh and the spirit of god came upon saul when he heard those tidings and his anger was kindled greatly and he took a yoke of oxen and hewed them in pieces and sent them throughout all the coasts of israel by the hands of messengers saying whosoever cometh not forth after saul and after samuel so shall it be done unto his oxen and the fear of the lord fell on the people and they came out with one consent and when he numbered them in bezek the children of israel were three hundred thousand and the men of judah thirty thousand and they said unto the messengers that came thus shall ye say unto the men of jabeshgilead to morrow by that time the sun be hot ye shall have help and the messengers came and shewed it to the men of jabesh
