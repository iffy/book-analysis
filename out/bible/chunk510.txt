unto her thou art the land that is not cleansed nor rained upon in the day of indignation there is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof like a roaring lion ravening the prey they have devoured souls they have taken the treasure and precious things they have made her many widows in the midst thereof her priests have violated my law and have profaned mine holy things they have put no difference between the holy and profane neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths and i am profaned among them her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey to shed blood and to destroy souls to get dishonest gain and her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter seeing vanity and divining lies unto them saying thus saith the lord god when the lord hath not spoken the people of the land have used oppression and exercised robbery and have vexed the poor and needy yea they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully and i sought for a man among them that should make up the hedge and stand in the gap before me for the land that i should not destroy it but i found none therefore have i poured out mine indignation upon them i have consumed them with the fire of my wrath their own way have i recompensed upon their heads saith the lord god the word of the lord came again unto me saying son of man there were two women the daughters of one mother and they committed whoredoms in egypt they committed whoredoms in their youth there were their breasts pressed and there they bruised the teats of their virginity and the names of them were aholah the elder and aholibah her sister and they were mine and they bare sons and daughters thus were their names samaria is aholah and jerusalem aholibah and aholah played the harlot when she was mine and she doted on her lovers on the assyrians her neighbours which were clothed with blue captains and rulers all of them desirable young men horsemen riding upon horses thus she committed her whoredoms with them with all them that were the chosen men of assyria and with all on whom she doted with all their idols she defiled herself neither left she her whoredoms brought from egypt for in her youth they lay with her and they bruised the breasts of her virginity and poured their whoredom upon her wherefore i have delivered her into the hand of her lovers into the hand of the assyrians upon whom she doted these discovered her nakedness they took her sons and her daughters and slew her with the sword and she became famous among women for they had executed judgment upon her and when her sister aholibah saw this she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms she doted upon the assyrians her neighbours captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously horsemen riding upon horses all of them desirable young men then i saw that she was defiled that they took both one way and that she increased her whoredoms for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall the images of the chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion girded with girdles upon their loins exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads all of them princes to look to after the manner of the babylonians of chaldea the land of their nativity and as soon as she saw them with her eyes she doted upon them and sent messengers unto them into chaldea and the babylonians came to her into the bed of love and they defiled her with their whoredom and she was polluted with them and her mind was alienated from them so she discovered her whoredoms and discovered her nakedness then my mind was alienated from her like as my mind was alienated from her sister yet she multiplied her whoredoms in calling to remembrance the days of her youth wherein she had played the harlot in the land of egypt for she doted upon their paramours whose flesh is as the flesh of asses and whose issue is like the issue of horses thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth in bruising thy teats by the egyptians for the paps of thy youth therefore o aholibah thus saith the lord god behold i will raise up thy lovers against thee from whom thy mind is alienated and i will bring them against thee on every side the babylonians and all the chaldeans pekod and shoa and koa and all the assyrians with them all of them desirable young men captains and rulers great lords and renowned all of them riding upon horses and they shall come against thee with chariots wagons and wheels and with an assembly of people which shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about and i will set judgment before them and they shall judge thee according to their judgments and i will set my jealousy against thee and they shall deal furiously with thee they shall take away thy nose and thine ears and thy remnant shall fall by the sword they shall take thy sons and thy daughters and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire they shall also strip thee out of thy clothes and take away thy fair jewels thus will i make thy lewdness to cease from thee and thy whoredom brought from the land of egypt so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them nor remember egypt any more for thus saith the lord god behold i will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest into the hand of them from whom thy mind is alienated and they shall deal with thee hatefully and shall take away all thy labour and shall leave thee naked and bare and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms i will do these things unto thee because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen and because thou art polluted with their idols thou hast walked in the way of thy sister therefore will i give her cup into thine hand thus
