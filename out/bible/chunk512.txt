of your eyes and that which your soul pitieth and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword and ye shall do as i have done ye shall not cover your lips nor eat the bread of men and your tires shall be upon your heads and your shoes upon your feet ye shall not mourn nor weep but ye shall pine away for your iniquities and mourn one toward another thus ezekiel is unto you a sign according to all that he hath done shall ye do and when this cometh ye shall know that i am the lord god also thou son of man shall it not be in the day when i take from them their strength the joy of their glory the desire of their eyes and that whereupon they set their minds their sons and their daughters that he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee to cause thee to hear it with thine ears in that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped and thou shalt speak and be no more dumb and thou shalt be a sign unto them and they shall know that i am the lord the word of the lord came again unto me saying son of man set thy face against the ammonites and prophesy against them and say unto the ammonites hear the word of the lord god thus saith the lord god because thou saidst aha against my sanctuary when it was profaned and against the land of israel when it was desolate and against the house of judah when they went into captivity behold therefore i will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession and they shall set their palaces in thee and make their dwellings in thee they shall eat thy fruit and they shall drink thy milk and i will make rabbah a stable for camels and the ammonites a couching place for flocks and ye shall know that i am the lord for thus saith the lord god because thou hast clapped thine hands and stamped with the feet and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite against the land of israel behold therefore i will stretch out mine hand upon thee and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen and i will cut thee off from the people and i will cause thee to perish out of the countries i will destroy thee and thou shalt know that i am the lord thus saith the lord god because that moab and seir do say behold the house of judah is like unto all the heathen therefore behold i will open the side of moab from the cities from his cities which are on his frontiers the glory of the country bethjeshimoth baalmeon and kiriathaim unto the men of the east with the ammonites and will give them in possession that the ammonites may not be remembered among the nations and i will execute judgments upon moab and they shall know that i am the lord thus saith the lord god because that edom hath dealt against the house of judah by taking vengeance and hath greatly offended and revenged himself upon them therefore thus saith the lord god i will also stretch out mine hand upon edom and will cut off man and beast from it and i will make it desolate from teman and they of dedan shall fall by the sword and i will lay my vengeance upon edom by the hand of my people israel and they shall do in edom according to mine anger and according to my fury and they shall know my vengeance saith the lord god thus saith the lord god because the philistines have dealt by revenge and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart to destroy it for the old hatred therefore thus saith the lord god behold i will stretch out mine hand upon the philistines and i will cut off the cherethims and destroy the remnant of the sea coast and i will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes and they shall know that i am the lord when i shall lay my vengeance upon them and it came to pass in the eleventh year in the first day of the month that the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man because

wherein is made a breach with the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets he shall slay thy people by the sword and thy strong garrisons shall go down to the ground and they shall make
