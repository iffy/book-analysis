of dumah he calleth to me out of seir watchman what of the night watchman what of the night the watchman said the morning cometh and also the night if ye will enquire enquire ye return come the burden upon arabia in the forest in arabia shall ye lodge o ye travelling companies of dedanim the inhabitants of the land of tema brought water to him that was thirsty they prevented with their bread him that fled for they fled from the swords from the drawn sword and from the bent bow and from the grievousness of war for thus hath the lord said unto me within a year according to the years of an hireling and all the glory of kedar shall fail and the residue of the number of archers the mighty men of the children of kedar shall be diminished for the lord god of israel hath spoken it the burden of the valley of vision what aileth thee now that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops thou that art full of stirs a tumultuous city joyous city thy slain men are not slain with the sword nor dead in battle all thy rulers are fled together they are bound by the archers all that are found in thee are bound together which have fled from far therefore said i look away from me i will weep bitterly labour not to comfort me because of the spoiling of the daughter of my people for it is a day of trouble and of treading down and of perplexity by the lord god of hosts in the valley of vision breaking down the walls and of crying to the mountains and elam bare the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen and kir uncovered the shield and it shall come to pass that thy choicest valleys shall be full of chariots and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at the gate and he discovered the covering of judah and thou didst look in that day to the armour of the house of the forest ye have seen also the breaches of the city of david that they are many and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool and ye have numbered the houses of jerusalem and the houses have ye broken down to fortify the wall ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof neither had respect unto him that fashioned it long ago and in that day did the lord god of hosts call to weeping and to mourning and to baldness and to girding with sackcloth and behold joy and gladness slaying oxen and killing sheep eating flesh and drinking wine let us eat and drink for to morrow we shall die and it was revealed in mine ears by the lord of hosts surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die saith the lord god of hosts thus saith the lord god of hosts go get thee unto this treasurer even unto shebna which is over the house and say what hast thou here and whom hast thou here that thou hast hewed thee out a sepulchre here as he that heweth him out a sepulchre on high and that graveth an habitation for himself in a rock behold the lord will carry thee away with a mighty captivity and will surely cover thee he will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a large country there shalt thou die and there the chariots of thy glory shall be the shame of thy lords house and i will drive thee from thy station and from thy state shall he pull thee down and it shall come to pass in that day that i will call my servant eliakim the son of hilkiah and i will clothe him with thy robe and strengthen him with thy girdle and i will commit thy government into his hand and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of jerusalem and to the house of judah and the key of the house of david will i lay upon his shoulder so he shall open and none shall shut and he shall shut and none shall open and i will fasten him as a nail in a sure place and he shall be for a glorious throne to his fathers house and they shall hang upon him all the glory of his fathers house the offspring and the issue all vessels of small quantity from the vessels of cups even to all the vessels of flagons in that day saith the lord of hosts shall the nail that is fastened in the sure place be removed and be cut down and fall and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off for the lord hath spoken it the burden of tyre howl ye ships of tarshish for it is laid waste so that there is no house no entering in from the land of chittim it is revealed to them be still ye inhabitants of the isle thou whom the merchants of zidon that pass over the sea have replenished and by great waters the seed of sihor the harvest of the river is her revenue and she is a mart of nations be thou ashamed o zidon for the sea hath spoken even the strength of the sea saying i travail not nor bring forth children neither do i nourish up young men nor bring up virgins as at the report concerning egypt so shall they be sorely pained at the report of tyre pass ye over to tarshish howl ye inhabitants of the isle is this your joyous city whose antiquity is of ancient days her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn who hath taken this counsel against tyre the crowning city whose merchants are princes whose traffickers are the honourable of the earth the lord of hosts hath purposed it to stain the pride of all glory and to bring into contempt all the honourable of the earth pass through thy land as a river o daughter of tarshish there is no more strength he stretched out his hand over the sea he shook the kingdoms the lord hath given a commandment
