for the likeness of their faces they four had the face of a man and the face of a lion on the right side and they four had the face of an ox on the left side they four also had the face of an eagle thus were their faces and their wings were stretched upward two wings of every one were joined one to another and two covered their bodies and they went every one straight forward whither the spirit was to go they went and they turned not when they went as for the likeness of the living creatures their appearance was like burning coals of fire and like the appearance of lamps it went up and down among the living creatures and the fire was bright and out of the fire went forth lightning and the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning now as i beheld the living creatures behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures with his four faces the appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl and they four had one likeness and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel when they went they went upon their four sides and they turned not when they went as for their rings they were so high that they were dreadful and their rings were full of eyes round about them four and when the living creatures went the wheels went by them and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up whithersoever the spirit was to go they went thither was their spirit to go and the wheels were lifted up over against them for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels when those went these went and when those stood these stood and when those were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up over against them for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels and the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal stretched forth over their heads above and under the firmament were their wings straight the one toward the other every one had two which covered on this side and every one had two which covered on that side their bodies and when they went i heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters as the voice of the almighty the voice of speech as the noise of an host when they stood they let down their wings and there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads when they stood and had let down their wings and above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne as the appearance of a sapphire stone and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it and i saw as the colour of amber as the appearance of fire round about within it from the appearance of his loins even upward and from the appearance of his loins even downward i saw as it were the appearance of fire and it had brightness round about as the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain so was the appearance of the brightness round about this was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the lord and when i saw it i fell upon my face and i heard a voice of one that spake and he said unto me son of man stand upon thy feet and i will speak unto thee and the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me and set me upon my feet that i heard him that spake unto me and he said unto me son of man i send thee to the children of israel to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me they and their fathers have transgressed against me even unto this very day for they are impudent children and stiffhearted i do send thee unto them and thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord god and they whether they will hear or whether they will forbear for they are a rebellious house yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them and thou son of man be not afraid of them neither be afraid of their words though briers and thorns be with thee and thou dost dwell among scorpions be not afraid of their words nor be dismayed at their looks though they be a rebellious house and thou shalt speak my words unto them whether they will hear or whether they will forbear for they are most rebellious but thou son of man hear what i say unto thee be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house open thy mouth and eat that i give thee and when i looked behold an hand was sent unto me and lo a roll of a book was therein and he spread it before me and it was written within and without and there was written therein lamentations and mourning and woe moreover he said unto me son of man eat that thou findest eat this roll and go speak unto the house of israel so i opened my mouth and he caused me to eat that roll and he said unto me son of man cause thy belly to eat and fill thy bowels with this roll that i give thee then did i eat it and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness and he said unto me son of man go get thee unto the house of israel and speak with my words unto them for thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language but to the house of israel not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language whose words thou canst not understand surely had i sent thee to them they would have hearkened unto thee but the house of israel will not hearken unto thee for they will not hearken unto me for all
