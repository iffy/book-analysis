for the which the lord thy god shall send thee to us whether it be good or whether it be evil we will obey the voice of the lord our god to whom we send thee that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of the lord our god and it came to pass after ten days that the word of the lord came unto jeremiah then called he johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces which were with him and all the people from the least even to the greatest and said unto them thus saith the lord the god of israel unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him if ye will still abide in this land then will i build you and not pull you down and i will plant you and not pluck you up for i repent me of the evil that i have done unto you be not afraid of the king of babylon of whom ye are afraid be not afraid of him saith the lord for i am with you to save you and to deliver you from his hand and i will shew mercies unto you that he may have mercy upon you and cause you to return to your own land but if ye say we will not dwell in this land neither obey the voice of the lord your god saying no but we will go into the land of egypt where we shall see no war nor hear the sound of the trumpet nor have hunger of bread and there will we dwell and now therefore hear the word of the lord ye remnant of judah thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel if ye wholly set your faces to enter into egypt and go to sojourn there then it shall come to pass that the sword which ye feared shall overtake you there in the land of egypt and the famine whereof ye were afraid shall follow close after you there in egypt and there ye shall die so shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into egypt to sojourn there they shall die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that i will bring upon them for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel as mine anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of jerusalem so shall my fury be poured forth upon you when ye shall enter into egypt and ye shall be an execration and an astonishment and a curse and a reproach and ye shall see this place no more the lord hath said concerning you o ye remnant of judah go ye not into egypt know certainly that i have admonished you this day for ye dissembled in your hearts when ye sent me unto the lord your god saying pray for us unto the lord our god and according unto all that the lord our god shall say so declare unto us and we will do it and now i have this day declared it to you but ye have not obeyed the voice of the lord your god nor any thing for the which he hath sent me unto you now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence in the place whither ye desire to go and to sojourn and it came to pass that when jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the lord their god for which the lord their god had sent him to them even all these words then spake azariah the son of hoshaiah and johanan the son of kareah and all the proud men saying unto jeremiah thou speakest falsely the lord our god hath not sent thee to say go not into egypt to sojourn there but baruch the son of neriah setteth thee on against us for to deliver us into the hand of the chaldeans that they might put us to death and carry us away captives into babylon so johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces and all the people obeyed not the voice of the lord to dwell in the land of judah but johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces took all the remnant of judah that were returned from all nations whither they had been driven to dwell in the land of judah even men and women and children and the kings daughters and every person that nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan and jeremiah the prophet and baruch the son of neriah so they came into the land of egypt for they obeyed not the voice of the lord thus came they even to tahpanhes then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah in tahpanhes saying take great stones in thine hand and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln which is at the entry of pharaohs house in tahpanhes in the sight of the men of judah and say unto them thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will send and take nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon my servant and will set his throne upon these stones that i have hid and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them and when he cometh he shall smite the land of egypt and deliver such as are for death to death and such as are for captivity to captivity and such as are for the sword to the sword and i will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of egypt and he shall burn them and carry them away captives and he shall array himself with the land of egypt as a shepherd putteth on his garment and he shall go forth from thence in peace he shall break also the images of bethshemesh that is in the land of egypt and the houses of the gods of the egyptians shall he burn with fire the word that came to jeremiah concerning
