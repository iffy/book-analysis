and to all thy friends and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies and thine eyes shall behold it and i will give all judah into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall carry them captive into babylon and shall slay them with the sword moreover i will deliver all the strength of this city and all the labours thereof and all the precious things thereof and all the treasures of the kings of judah will i give into the hand of their enemies which shall spoil them and take them and carry them to babylon and thou pashur and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity and thou shalt come to babylon and there thou shalt die and shalt be buried there thou and all thy friends to whom thou hast prophesied lies o lord thou hast deceived me and i was deceived thou art stronger than i and hast prevailed i am in derision daily every one mocketh me for since i spake i cried out i cried violence and spoil because the word of the lord was made a reproach unto me and a derision daily then i said i will not make mention of him nor speak any more in his name but his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones and i was weary with forbearing and i could not stay for i heard the defaming of many fear on every side report say they and we will report it all my familiars watched for my halting saying peradventure he will be enticed and we shall prevail against him and we shall take our revenge on him but the lord is with me as a mighty terrible one therefore my persecutors shall stumble and they shall not prevail they shall be greatly ashamed for they shall not prosper their everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten but o lord of hosts that triest the righteous and seest the reins and the heart let me see thy vengeance on them for unto thee have i opened my cause sing unto the lord praise ye the lord for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers cursed be the day wherein i was born let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father saying a man child is born unto thee making him very glad and let that man be as the cities which the lord overthrew and repented not and let him hear the cry in the morning and the shouting at noontide because he slew me not from the womb or that my mother might have been my grave and her womb to be always great with me wherefore came i forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow that my days should be consumed with shame the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord when king zedekiah sent unto him pashur the son of melchiah and zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest saying enquire i pray thee of the lord for us for nebuchadrezzar king of babylon maketh war against us if so be that the lord will deal with us according to all his wondrous works that he may go up from us then said jeremiah unto them thus shall ye say to zedekiah thus saith the lord god of israel behold i will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands wherewith ye fight against the king of babylon and against the chaldeans which besiege you without the walls and i will assemble them into the midst of this city and i myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm even in anger and in fury and in great wrath and i will smite the inhabitants of this city both man and beast they shall die of a great pestilence and afterward saith the lord i will deliver zedekiah king of judah and his servants and the people and such as are left in this city from the pestilence from the sword and from the famine into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those that seek their life and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword he shall not spare them neither have pity nor have mercy and unto this people thou shalt say thus saith the lord behold i set before you the way of life and the way of death he that abideth in this city shall die by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence but he that goeth out and falleth to the chaldeans that besiege you he shall live and his life shall be unto him for a prey for i have set my face against this city for evil and not for good saith the lord it shall be given into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall burn it with fire and touching the house of the king of judah say hear ye the word of the lord o house of david thus saith the lord execute judgment in the morning and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor lest my fury go out like fire and burn that none can quench it because of the evil of your doings behold i am against thee o inhabitant of the valley and rock of the plain saith the lord which say who shall come down against us or who shall enter into our habitations but i will punish you according to the fruit of your doings saith the lord and i will kindle a fire in the forest thereof and it shall devour all things round about it thus saith the lord go down to the house of the king of judah and speak there this word and say hear the word of the lord o king of judah that sittest upon the throne of david thou and thy servants and thy people that enter in by these gates thus saith the lord execute ye judgment and righteousness and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor and do no wrong
