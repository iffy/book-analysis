upon their feet and old garments upon them and all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy and they went to joshua unto the camp at gilgal and said unto him and to the men of israel we be come from a far country now therefore make ye a league with us and the men of israel said unto the hivites peradventure ye dwell among us and how shall we make a league with you and they said unto joshua we are thy servants and joshua said unto them who are ye and from whence come ye and they said unto him from a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the lord thy god for we have heard the fame of him and all that he did in egypt and all that he did to the two kings of the amorites that were beyond jordan to sihon king of heshbon and to og king of bashan which was at ashtaroth wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us saying take victuals with you for the journey and go to meet them and say unto them we are your servants therefore now make ye a league with us this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you but now behold it is dry and it is mouldy and these bottles of wine which we filled were new and behold they be rent and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey and the men took of their victuals and asked not counsel at the mouth of the lord and joshua made peace with them and made a league with them to let them live and the princes of the congregation sware unto them and it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them that they heard that they were their neighbours and that they dwelt among them and the children of israel journeyed and came unto their cities on the third day now their cities were gibeon and chephirah and beeroth and kirjathjearim and the children of israel smote them not because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the lord god of israel and all the congregation murmured against the princes but all the princes said unto all the congregation we have sworn unto them by the lord god of israel now therefore we may not touch them this we will do to them we will even let them live lest wrath be upon us because of the oath which we sware unto them and the princes said unto them let them live but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation as the princes had promised them and joshua called for them and he spake unto them saying wherefore have ye beguiled us saying we are very far from you when ye dwell among us now therefore ye are cursed and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my god and they answered joshua and said because it was certainly told thy servants how that the lord thy god commanded his servant moses to give you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you and have done this thing and now behold we are in thine hand as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us do and so did he unto them and delivered them out of the hand of the children of israel that they slew them not and joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the lord even unto this day in the place which he should choose now it came to pass when adonizedec king of jerusalem had heard how joshua had taken ai and had utterly destroyed it as he had done to jericho and her king so he had done to ai and her king and how the inhabitants of gibeon had made peace with israel and were among them that they feared greatly because gibeon was a great city as one of the royal cities and because it was greater than ai and all the men thereof were mighty wherefore adonizedec king of jerusalem sent unto hoham king of hebron and unto piram king of jarmuth and unto japhia king of lachish and unto debir king of eglon saying come up unto me and help me that we may smite gibeon for it hath made peace with joshua and with the children of israel therefore the five kings of the amorites the king of jerusalem the king of hebron the king of jarmuth the king of lachish the king of eglon gathered themselves together and went up they and all their hosts and encamped before gibeon and made war against it and the men of gibeon sent unto joshua to the camp to gilgal saying slack not thy hand from thy servants come up to us quickly and save us and help us for all the kings of the amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us so joshua ascended from gilgal he and all the people of war with him and all the mighty men of valour and the lord said unto joshua fear them not for i have delivered them into thine hand there shall not a man of them stand before thee joshua therefore came unto them suddenly and went up from gilgal all night and the lord discomfited them before israel and slew them with a great slaughter at gibeon and chased them along the way that goeth up to bethhoron and smote them to azekah and unto makkedah and it came to pass as they fled from before israel and were in the going down to bethhoron that the lord cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto azekah and they died they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of israel slew with the
