and he took thereof in his hands and went on eating and came to his father and mother and he gave them and they did eat but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion so his father went down unto the woman and samson made there a feast for so used the young men to do and it came to pass when they saw him that they brought thirty companions to be with him and samson said unto them i will now put forth a riddle unto you if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast and find it out then i will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments but if ye cannot declare it me then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments and they said unto him put forth thy riddle that we may hear it and he said unto them out of the eater came forth meat and out of the strong came forth sweetness and they could not in three days expound the riddle and it came to pass on the seventh day that they said unto samsons wife entice thy husband that he may declare unto us the riddle lest we burn thee and thy fathers house with fire have ye called us to take that we have is it not so and samsons wife wept before him and said thou dost but hate me and lovest me not thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people and hast not told it me and he said unto her behold i have not told it my father nor my mother and shall i tell it thee and she wept before him the seven days while their feast lasted and it came to pass on the seventh day that he told her because she lay sore upon him and she told the riddle to the children of her people and the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down what is sweeter than honey and what is stronger than a lion and he said unto them if ye had not plowed with my heifer ye had not found out my riddle and the spirit of the lord came upon him and he went down to ashkelon and slew thirty men of them and took their spoil and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle and his anger was kindled and he went up to his fathers house but samsons wife was given to his companion whom he had used as his friend but it came to pass within a while after in the time of wheat harvest that samson visited his wife with a kid and he said i will go in to my wife into the chamber but her father would not suffer him to go in and her father said i verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her therefore i gave her to thy companion is not her younger sister fairer than she take her i pray thee instead of her and samson said concerning them now shall i be more blameless than the philistines though i do them a displeasure and samson went and caught three hundred foxes and took firebrands and turned tail to tail and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails and when he had set the brands on fire he let them go into the standing corn of the philistines and burnt up both the shocks and also the standing corn with the vineyards and olives then the philistines said who hath done this and they answered samson the son in law of the timnite because he had taken his wife and given her to his companion and the philistines came up and burnt her and her father with fire and samson said unto them though ye have done this yet will i be avenged of you and after that i will cease and he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock etam then the philistines went up and pitched in judah and spread themselves in lehi and the men of judah said why are ye come up against us and they answered to bind samson are we come up to do to him as he hath done to us then three thousand men of judah went to the top of the rock etam and said to samson knowest thou not that the philistines are rulers over us what is this that thou hast done unto us and he said unto them as they did unto me so have i done unto them and they said unto him we are come down to bind thee that we may deliver thee into the hand of the philistines and samson said unto them swear unto me that ye will not fall upon me yourselves and they spake unto him saying no but we will bind thee fast and deliver thee into their hand but surely we will not kill thee and they bound him with two new cords and brought him up from the rock and when he came unto lehi the philistines shouted against him and the spirit of the lord came mightily upon him and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire and his bands loosed from off his hands and he found a new jawbone of an ass and put forth his hand and took it and slew a thousand men therewith and samson said with the jawbone of an ass heaps upon heaps with the jaw of an ass have i slain a thousand men and it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand and called that place ramathlehi and he was sore athirst and called on the lord and said thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant and now shall i die for thirst and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised but god clave an hollow place that was in the jaw and there came water thereout and when he had drunk
