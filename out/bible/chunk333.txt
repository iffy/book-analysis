his princes and his servants the power of persia and media the nobles and princes of the provinces being before him when he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days even an hundred and fourscore days and when these days were expired the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in shushan the palace both unto great and small seven days in the court of the garden of the kings palace where were white green and blue hangings fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble the beds were of gold and silver upon a pavement of red and blue and white and black marble and they gave them drink in vessels of gold the vessels being diverse one from another and royal wine in abundance according to the state of the king and the drinking was according to the law none did compel for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house that they should do according to every mans pleasure also vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king ahasuerus on the seventh day when the heart of the king was merry with wine he commanded mehuman biztha harbona bigtha and abagtha zethar and carcas the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of ahasuerus the king to bring vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal to shew the people and the princes her beauty for she was fair to look on but the queen vashti refused to come at the kings commandment by his chamberlains therefore was the king very wroth and his anger burned in him then the king said to the wise men which knew the times for so was the kings manner toward all that knew law and judgment and the next unto him was carshena shethar admatha tarshish meres marsena and memucan the seven princes of persia and media which saw the kings face and which sat the first in the kingdom what shall we do unto the queen vashti according to law because she hath not performed the commandment of the king ahasuerus by the chamberlains and memucan answered before the king and the princes vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only but also to all the princes and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king ahasuerus for this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes when it shall be reported the king ahasuerus commanded vashti the queen to be brought in before him but she came not likewise shall the ladies of persia and media say this day unto all the kings princes which have heard of the deed of the queen thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath if it please the king let there go a royal commandment from him and let it be written among the laws of the persians and the medes that it be not altered that vashti come no more before king ahasuerus and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she and when the kings decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire for it is great all the wives shall give to their husbands honour both to great and small and the saying pleased the king and the princes and the king did according to the word of memucan for he sent letters into all the kings provinces into every province according to the writing thereof and to every people after their language that every man should bear rule in his own house and that it should be published according to the language of every people after these things when the wrath of king ahasuerus was appeased he remembered vashti and what she had done and what was decreed against her then said the kings servants that ministered unto him let there be fair young virgins sought for the king and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto shushan the palace to the house of the women unto the custody of hege the kings chamberlain keeper of the women and let their things for purification be given them and let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of vashti and the thing pleased the king and he did so now in shushan the palace there was a certain jew whose name was mordecai the son of jair the son of shimei the son of kish a benjamite who had been carried away from jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with jeconiah king of judah whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried away and he brought up hadassah that is esther his uncles daughter for she had neither father nor mother and the maid was fair and beautiful whom mordecai when her father and mother were dead took for his own daughter so it came to pass when the kings commandment and his decree was heard and when many maidens were gathered together unto shushan the palace to the custody of hegai that esther was brought also unto the kings house to the custody of hegai keeper of the women and the maiden pleased him and she obtained kindness of him and he speedily gave her her things for purification with such things as belonged to her and seven maidens which were meet to be given her out of the kings house and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred for mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it and mordecai walked every day before the court of the womens house to know how esther did and what should become of her now when every maids turn was come to go in to king ahasuerus after that she had been twelve months according to the manner of the women for so were the days of their purifications accomplished to wit six months with oil of myrrh and six months
