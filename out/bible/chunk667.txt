jerusalem for to be punished and it came to pass that as i made my journey and was come nigh unto damascus about noon suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me and i fell unto the ground and heard a voice saying unto me saul saul why persecutest thou me and i answered who art thou lord and he said unto me i am jesus of nazareth whom thou persecutest and they that were with me saw indeed the light and were afraid but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me and i said what shall i do lord and the lord said unto me arise and go into damascus and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do and when i could not see for the glory of that light being led by the hand of them that were with me i came into damascus and one ananias a devout man according to the law having a good report of all the jews which dwelt there came unto me and stood and said unto me brother saul receive thy sight and the same hour i looked up upon him and he said the god of our fathers hath chosen thee that thou shouldest know his will and see that just one and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth for thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard and now why tarriest thou arise and be baptized and wash away thy sins calling on the name of the lord and it came to pass that when i was come again to jerusalem even while i prayed in the temple i was in a trance and saw him saying unto me make haste and get thee quickly out of jerusalem for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me and i said lord they know that i imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee and when the blood of thy martyr stephen was shed i also was standing by and consenting unto his death and kept the raiment of them that slew him and he said unto me depart for i will send thee far hence unto the gentiles and they gave him audience unto this word and then lifted up their voices and said away with such a fellow from the earth for it is not fit that he should live and as they cried out and cast off their clothes and threw dust into the air the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle and bade that he should be examined by scourging that he might know wherefore they cried so against him and as they bound him with thongs paul said unto the centurion that stood by is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a roman and uncondemned when the centurion heard that he went and told the chief captain saying take heed what thou doest for this man is a roman then the chief captain came and said unto him tell me art thou a roman he said yea and the chief captain answered with a great sum obtained i this freedom and paul said but i was free born then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him and the chief captain also was afraid after he knew that he was a roman and because he had bound him on the morrow because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the jews he loosed him from his bands and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear and brought paul down and set him before them and paul earnestly beholding the council said men and brethren i have lived in all good conscience before god until this day and the high priest ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth then said paul unto him god shall smite thee thou whited wall for sittest thou to judge me after the law and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law and they that stood by said revilest thou gods high priest then said paul i wist not brethren that he was the high priest for it is written thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people but when paul perceived that the one part were sadducees and the other pharisees he cried out in the council men and brethren i am a pharisee the son of a pharisee of the hope and resurrection of the dead i am called in question and when he had so said there arose a dissension between the pharisees and the sadducees and the multitude was divided for the sadducees say that there is no resurrection neither angel nor spirit but the pharisees confess both and there arose a great cry and the scribes that were of the pharisees part arose and strove saying we find no evil in this man but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him let us not fight against god and when there arose a great dissension the chief captain fearing lest paul should have been pulled in pieces of them commanded the soldiers to go down and to take him by force from among them and to bring him into the castle and the night following the lord stood by him and said be of good cheer paul for as thou hast testified of me in jerusalem so must thou bear witness also at rome and when it was day certain of the jews banded together and bound themselves under a curse saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed paul and they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy and they came to the chief priests and elders and said we have bound ourselves under a great curse that we will eat nothing until we have slain paul now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him and we or ever he come near are ready to kill him and when pauls sisters son heard of their lying in wait
