said there is for said he thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of babylon moreover jeremiah said unto king zedekiah what have i offended against thee or against thy servants or against this people that ye have put me in prison where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you saying the king of babylon shall not come against you nor against this land therefore hear now i pray thee o my lord the king let my supplication i pray thee be accepted before thee that thou cause me not to return to the house of jonathan the scribe lest i die there then zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit jeremiah into the court of the prison and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers street until all the bread in the city were spent thus jeremiah remained in the court of the prison then shephatiah the son of mattan and gedaliah the son of pashur and jucal the son of shelemiah and pashur the son of malchiah heard the words that jeremiah had spoken unto all the people saying thus saith the lord he that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence but he that goeth forth to the chaldeans shall live for he shall have his life for a prey and shall live thus saith the lord this city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of babylons army which shall take it therefore the princes said unto the king we beseech thee let this man be put to death for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city and the hands of all the people in speaking such words unto them for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people but the hurt then zedekiah the king said behold he is in your hand for the king is not he that can do any thing against you then took they jeremiah and cast him into the dungeon of malchiah the son of hammelech that was in the court of the prison and they let down jeremiah with cords and in the dungeon there was no water but mire so jeremiah sunk in the mire now when ebedmelech the ethiopian one of the eunuchs which was in the kings house heard that they had put jeremiah in the dungeon the king then sitting in the gate of benjamin ebedmelech went forth out of the kings house and spake to the king saying my lord the king these men have done evil in all that they have done to jeremiah the prophet whom they have cast into the dungeon and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is for there is no more bread in the city then the king commanded ebedmelech the ethiopian saying take from hence thirty men with thee and take up jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon before he die so ebedmelech took the men with him and went into the house of the king under the treasury and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags and let them down by cords into the dungeon to jeremiah and ebedmelech the ethiopian said unto jeremiah put now these old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords and jeremiah did so so they drew up jeremiah with cords and took him up out of the dungeon and jeremiah remained in the court of the prison then zedekiah the king sent and took jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the lord and the king said unto jeremiah i will ask thee a thing hide nothing from me then jeremiah said unto zedekiah if i declare it unto thee wilt thou not surely put me to death and if i give thee counsel wilt thou not hearken unto me so zedekiah the king sware secretly unto jeremiah saying as the lord liveth that made us this soul i will not put thee to death neither will i give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life then said jeremiah unto zedekiah thus saith the lord the god of hosts the god of israel if thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of babylons princes then thy soul shall live and this city shall not be burned with fire and thou shalt live and thine house but if thou wilt not go forth to the king of babylons princes then shall this city be given into the hand of the chaldeans and they shall burn it with fire and thou shalt not escape out of their hand and zedekiah the king said unto jeremiah i am afraid of the jews that are fallen to the chaldeans lest they deliver me into their hand and they mock me but jeremiah said they shall not deliver thee obey i beseech thee the voice of the lord which i speak unto thee so it shall be well unto thee and thy soul shall live but if thou refuse to go forth this is the word that the lord hath shewed me and behold all the women that are left in the king of judahs house shall be brought forth to the king of babylons princes and those women shall say thy friends have set thee on and have prevailed against thee thy feet are sunk in the mire and they are turned away back so they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the chaldeans and thou shalt not escape out of their hand but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of babylon and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire then said zedekiah unto jeremiah let no man know of these words and thou shalt not die but if the princes hear that i have talked with thee and they come unto thee and say unto thee declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king hide it not from us and we will not put thee to death also what the king said unto thee then thou shalt say unto them i presented my supplication before the king that he
