of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of assyria where are the gods of hamath and arphad where are the gods of sepharvaim and have they delivered samaria out of my hand who are they among all the gods of these lands that have delivered their land out of my hand that the lord should deliver jerusalem out of my hand but they held their peace and answered him not a word for the kings commandment was saying answer him not then came eliakim the son of hilkiah that was over the household and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder to hezekiah with their clothes rent and told him the words of rabshakeh and it came to pass when king hezekiah heard it that he rent his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the lord and he sent eliakim who was over the household and shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth unto isaiah the prophet the son of amoz and they said unto him thus saith hezekiah this day is a day of trouble and of rebuke and of blasphemy for the children are come to the birth and there is not strength to bring forth it may be the lord thy god will hear the words of rabshakeh whom the king of assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living god and will reprove the words which the lord thy god hath heard wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left so the servants of king hezekiah came to isaiah and isaiah said unto them thus shall ye say unto your master thus saith the lord be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard wherewith the servants of the king of assyria have blasphemed me behold i will send a blast upon him and he shall hear a rumour and return to his own land and i will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land so rabshakeh returned and found the king of assyria warring against libnah for he had heard that he was departed from lachish and he heard say concerning tirhakah king of ethiopia he is come forth to make war with thee and when he heard it he sent messengers to hezekiah saying thus shall ye speak to hezekiah king of judah saying let not thy god in whom thou trustest deceive thee saying jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of assyria behold thou hast heard what the kings of assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly and shalt thou be delivered have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed as gozan and haran and rezeph and the children of eden which were in telassar where is the king of hamath and the king of arphad and the king of the city of sepharvaim hena and ivah and hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it and hezekiah went up unto the house of the lord and spread it before the lord and hezekiah prayed unto the lord saying o lord of hosts god of israel that dwellest between the cherubims thou art the god even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou hast made heaven and earth incline thine ear o lord and hear open thine eyes o lord and see and hear all the words of sennacherib which hath sent to reproach the living god of a truth lord the kings of assyria have laid waste all the nations and their countries and have cast their gods into the fire for they were no gods but the work of mens hands wood and stone therefore they have destroyed them now therefore o lord our god save us from his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the lord even thou only then isaiah the son of amoz sent unto hezekiah saying thus saith the lord god of israel whereas thou hast prayed to me against sennacherib king of assyria this is the word which the lord hath spoken concerning him the virgin the daughter of zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn the daughter of jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high even against the holy one of israel by thy servants hast thou reproached the lord and hast said by the multitude of my chariots am i come up to the height of the mountains to the sides of lebanon and i will cut down the tall cedars thereof and the choice fir trees thereof and i will enter into the height of his border and the forest of his carmel i have digged and drunk water and with the sole of my feet have i dried up all the rivers of the besieged places hast thou not heard long ago how i have done it and of ancient times that i have formed it now have i brought it to pass that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heaps therefore their inhabitants were of small power they were dismayed and confounded they were as the grass of the field and as the green herb as the grass on the housetops and as corn blasted before it be grown up but i know thy abode and thy going out and thy coming in and thy rage against me because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears therefore will i put my hook in thy nose and my bridle in thy lips and i will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest and this shall be a sign unto thee ye shall eat this year such as groweth of itself and the second year that which springeth of the same and in the third year sow ye and reap and plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof and the remnant that is escaped of the house of judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward for out of jerusalem shall go
