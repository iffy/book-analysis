so that ye cannot do the things that ye would but if ye be led of the spirit ye are not under the law now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions heresies envyings murders drunkenness revellings and such like of the which i tell you before as i have also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law and they that are christs have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit let us not be desirous of vain glory provoking one another envying one another brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted bear ye one anothers burdens and so fulfil the law of christ for if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing he deceiveth himself but let every man prove his own work and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone and not in another for every man shall bear his own burden let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things be not deceived god is not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap for he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting and let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the

suffer persecution for the cross of christ for neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law but desire to have you circumcised that they may glory in your flesh but god forbid that i should glory save in the cross of our lord jesus christ by whom the world is crucified unto me and i unto the world for in christ jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision but a new creature and as many as walk according to this rule peace be on them and mercy and upon the israel of god from henceforth let no man trouble me for i bear in my body the marks of the lord jesus brethren the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit amen the epistle of paul the apostle to the ephesians paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto
