spirit may be saved in the day of the lord jesus your glorying is not good know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump purge out therefore the old leaven that ye may be a new lump as ye are unleavened for even christ our passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth i wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world or with the covetous or extortioners or with idolaters for then must ye needs go out of the world but now i have written unto you not to keep company if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator or covetous or an idolater or a railer or a drunkard or an extortioner with such an one no not to eat for what have i to do to judge them also that are without do not ye judge them that are within but them that are without god judgeth therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person dare any of you having a matter against another go to law before the unjust and not before the saints do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters know ye not that we shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this life if then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church i speak to your shame is it so that there is not a wise man among you no not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren but brother goeth to law with brother and that before the unbelievers now therefore there is utterly a fault among you because ye go to law one with another why do ye not rather take wrong why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded nay ye do wrong and defraud and that your brethren know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of god and such were some of you but ye are washed but ye are sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but i will not be brought under the power of any meats for the belly and the belly for meats but god shall destroy both it and them now the body is not for fornication but for the lord and the lord for the body and god hath both raised up the lord and will also raise up us by his own power know ye not that your bodies are the members of christ shall i then take the members of christ and make them the members of an harlot god forbid what know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body for two saith he shall be one flesh but he that is joined unto the lord is one spirit flee fornication every sin that a man doeth is without the body but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body what know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which ye have of god and ye are not your own for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are gods now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me it is good for a man not to touch a woman nevertheless to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife and let every woman have her own husband let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence and likewise also the wife unto the husband the wife hath not power of her own body but the husband and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body but the wife defraud ye not one the other except it be with consent for a time that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer and come together again that satan tempt you not for your incontinency but i speak this by permission and not of commandment for i would that all men were even as i myself but every man hath his proper gift of god one after this manner and another after that i say therefore to the unmarried and widows it is good for them if they abide even as i but if they cannot contain let them marry for it is better to marry than to burn and unto the married i command yet not i but the lord let not the wife depart from her husband but and if she depart let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband and let not the husband put away his wife but to the rest speak i not the lord if any brother hath a wife that believeth not and she be pleased to dwell with him let him not put her away and the woman which hath an husband that believeth not and if he be pleased to dwell with her let her not leave him for the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband else were your children unclean but now are they holy but if the unbelieving depart let him depart a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases but god hath called us to peace for what knowest thou o wife whether thou shalt save thy husband or how knowest thou o man whether thou shalt save thy wife but as god hath distributed to every man as the lord hath called every one so let him walk and so ordain i in all churches is any man called being
