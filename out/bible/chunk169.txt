cakes of an ephah of flour the flesh he put in a basket and he put the broth in a pot and brought it out unto him under the oak and presented it and the angel of god said unto him take the flesh and the unleavened cakes and lay them upon this rock and pour out the broth and he did so then the angel of the lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes and there rose up fire out of the rock and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes then the angel of the lord departed out of his sight and when gideon perceived that he was an angel of the lord gideon said alas o lord god for because i have seen an angel of the lord face to face and the lord said unto him peace be unto thee fear not thou shalt not die then gideon built an altar there unto the lord and called it jehovahshalom unto this day it is yet in ophrah of the abiezrites and it came to pass the same night that the lord said unto him take thy fathers young bullock even the second bullock of seven years old and throw down the altar of baal that thy father hath and cut down the grove that is by it and build an altar unto the lord thy god upon the top of this rock in the ordered place and take the second bullock and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down then gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the lord had said unto him and so it was because he feared his fathers household and the men of the city that he could not do it by day that he did it by night and when the men of the city arose early in the morning behold the altar of baal was cast down and the grove was cut down that was by it and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built and they said one to another who hath done this thing and when they enquired and asked they said gideon the son of joash hath done this thing then the men of the city said unto joash bring out thy son that he may die because he hath cast down the altar of baal and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it and joash said unto all that stood against him will ye plead for baal will ye save him he that will plead for him let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning if he be a god let him plead for himself because one hath cast down his altar therefore on that day he called him jerubbaal saying let baal plead against him because he hath thrown down his altar then all the midianites and the amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together and went over and pitched in the valley of jezreel but the spirit of the lord came upon gideon and he blew a trumpet and abiezer was gathered after him and he sent messengers throughout all manasseh who also was gathered after him and he sent messengers unto asher and unto zebulun and unto naphtali and they came up to meet them and gideon said unto god if thou wilt save israel by mine hand as thou hast said behold i will put a fleece of wool in the floor and if the dew be on the fleece only and it be dry upon all the earth beside then shall i know that thou wilt save israel by mine hand as thou hast said and it was so for he rose up early on the morrow and thrust the fleece together and wringed the dew out of the fleece a bowl full of water and gideon said unto god let not thine anger be hot against me and i will speak but this once let me prove i pray thee but this once with the fleece let it now be dry only upon the fleece and upon all the ground let there be dew and god did so that night for it was dry upon the fleece only and there was dew on all the ground then jerubbaal who is gideon and all the people that were with him rose up early and pitched beside the well of harod so that the host of the midianites were on the north side of them by the hill of moreh in the valley and the lord said unto gideon the people that are with thee are too many for me to give the midianites into their hands lest israel vaunt themselves against me saying mine own hand hath saved me now therefore go to proclaim in the ears of the people saying whosoever is fearful and afraid let him return and depart early from mount gilead and there returned of the people twenty and two thousand and there remained ten thousand and the lord said unto gideon the people are yet too many bring them down unto the water and i will try them for thee there and it shall be that of whom i say unto thee this shall go with thee the same shall go with thee and of whomsoever i say unto thee this shall not go with thee the same shall not go so he brought down the people unto the water and the lord said unto gideon every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue as a dog lappeth him shalt thou set by himself likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink and the number of them that lapped putting their hand to their mouth were three hundred men but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water and the lord said unto gideon by the three hundred men that lapped will i save you and deliver the midianites into thine hand and let all the other people go every man unto his place so the people took victuals in their hand and their trumpets and he sent all the rest of israel every
