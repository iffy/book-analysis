goeth up from jericho throughout mount bethel and goeth out from bethel to luz and passeth along unto the borders of archi to ataroth and goeth down westward to the coast of japhleti unto the coast of bethhoron the nether and to gezer and the goings out thereof are at the sea so the children of joseph manasseh and ephraim took their inheritance and the border of the children of ephraim according to their families was thus even the border of their inheritance on the east side was atarothaddar unto bethhoron the upper and the border went out toward the sea to michmethah on the north side and the border went about eastward unto taanathshiloh and passed by it on the east to janohah and it went down from janohah to ataroth and to naarath and came to jericho and went out at jordan the border went out from tappuah westward unto the river kanah and the goings out thereof were at the sea this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of ephraim by their families and the separate cities for the children of ephraim were among the inheritance of the children of manasseh all the cities with their villages and they drave not out the canaanites that dwelt in gezer but the canaanites dwell among the ephraimites unto this day and serve under tribute there was also a lot for the tribe of manasseh for he was the firstborn of joseph to wit for machir the firstborn of manasseh the father of gilead because he was a man of war therefore he had gilead and bashan there was also a lot for the rest of the children of manasseh by their families for the children of abiezer and for the children of helek and for the children of asriel and for the children of shechem and for the children of hepher and for the children of shemida these were the male children of manasseh the son of joseph by their families but zelophehad the son of hepher the son of gilead the son of machir the son of manasseh had no sons but daughters and these are the names of his daughters mahlah and noah hoglah milcah and tirzah and they came near before eleazar the priest and before joshua the son of nun and before the princes saying the lord commanded moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren therefore according to the commandment of the lord he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father and there fell ten portions to manasseh beside the land of gilead and bashan which were on the other side jordan because the daughters of manasseh had an inheritance among his sons and the rest of manassehs sons had the land of gilead and the coast of manasseh was from asher to michmethah that lieth before shechem and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of entappuah now manasseh had the land of tappuah but tappuah on the border of manasseh belonged to the children of ephraim and the coast descended unto the river kanah southward of the river these cities of ephraim are among the cities of manasseh the coast of manasseh also was on the north side of the river and the outgoings of it were at the sea southward it was ephraims and northward it was manassehs and the sea is his border and they met together in asher on the north and in issachar on the east and manasseh had in issachar and in asher bethshean and her towns and ibleam and her towns and the inhabitants of dor and her towns and the inhabitants of endor and her towns and the inhabitants of taanach and her towns and the inhabitants of megiddo and her towns even three countries yet the children of manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities but the canaanites would dwell in that land yet it came to pass when the children of israel were waxen strong that they put the canaanites to tribute but did not utterly drive them out and the children of joseph spake unto joshua
