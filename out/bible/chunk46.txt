seen to day ye shall see them again no more for ever the lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace and the lord said unto moses wherefore criest thou unto me speak unto the children of israel that they go forward but lift thou up thy rod and stretch out thine hand over the sea and divide it and the children of israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea and i behold i will harden the hearts of the egyptians and they shall follow them and i will get me honour upon pharaoh and upon all his host upon his chariots and upon his horsemen and the egyptians shall know that i am the lord when i have gotten me honour upon pharaoh upon his chariots and upon his horsemen and the angel of god which went before the camp of israel removed and went behind them and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face and stood behind them and it came between the camp of the egyptians and the camp of israel and it was a cloud and darkness to them but it gave light by night to these so that the one came not near the other all the night and moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night and made the sea dry land and the waters were divided and the children of israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left and the egyptians pursued and went in after them to the midst of the sea even all pharaohs horses his chariots and his horsemen and it came to pass that in the morning watch the lord looked unto the host of the egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud and troubled the host of the egyptians and took off their chariot wheels that they drave them heavily so that the egyptians said let us flee from the face of israel for the lord fighteth for them against the egyptians and the lord said unto moses stretch out thine hand over the sea that the waters may come again upon the egyptians upon their chariots and upon their horsemen and moses stretched forth his hand over the sea and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared and the egyptians fled against it and the lord overthrew the egyptians in the midst of the sea and the waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen and all the host of pharaoh that came into the sea after them there remained not so much as one of them but the children of israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left thus the lord saved israel that day out of the hand of the egyptians and israel saw the egyptians dead upon the sea shore and israel saw that great work which the lord did upon the egyptians and the people feared the lord and believed the lord and his servant moses then sang moses and the children of israel this song unto the lord and spake saying i will sing unto the lord for he hath triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea the lord is my strength and song and he is become my salvation he is my god and i will prepare him an habitation my fathers god and i will exalt him the lord is a man of war the lord is his name pharaohs chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea his chosen captains also are drowned in the red sea the depths have covered them they sank into the bottom as a stone thy right hand o lord is become glorious in power thy right hand o lord hath dashed in pieces the enemy and in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee thou sentest forth thy wrath which consumed them as stubble and with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together the floods stood upright as an heap and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea the enemy said i will pursue i will overtake i will divide the spoil my lust shall be satisfied upon them i will draw my sword my hand shall destroy them thou didst blow with thy wind the sea covered them they sank as lead in the mighty waters who is like unto thee o lord among the gods who is like thee glorious in holiness fearful in praises doing wonders thou stretchedst out thy right hand the earth swallowed them thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation the people shall hear and be afraid sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of palestina then the dukes of edom shall be amazed the mighty men of moab trembling shall take hold upon them all the inhabitants of canaan shall melt away fear and dread shall fall upon them by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone till thy people pass over o lord till the people pass over which thou hast purchased

lord shall reign for ever and ever for the horse of pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea and the lord brought again the waters of the sea upon them but the children of israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea and miriam the prophetess the sister of aaron took a timbrel in her hand and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances and miriam answered them sing ye to the lord for he hath triumphed gloriously the horse and
