women and david answered the priest and said unto him of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days since i came out and the vessels of the young men are holy and the bread is in a manner common yea though it were sanctified this day in the vessel so the priest gave him hallowed bread for there was no bread there but the shewbread that was taken from before the lord to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away now a certain man of the servants of saul was there that day detained before the lord and his name was doeg an edomite the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to saul and david said unto ahimelech and is there not here under thine hand spear or sword for i have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me because the kings business required haste and the priest said the sword of goliath the philistine whom thou slewest in the valley of elah behold it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod if thou wilt take that take it for there is no other save that here and david said there is none like that give it me and david arose and fled that day for fear of saul and went to achish the king of gath and the servants of achish said unto him is not this david the king of the land did they not sing one to another of him in dances saying saul hath slain his thousands and david his ten thousands and david laid up these words in his heart and was sore afraid of achish the king of gath and he changed his behaviour before them and feigned himself mad in their hands and scrabbled on the doors of the gate and let his spittle fall down upon his beard then said achish unto his servants lo ye see the man is mad wherefore then have ye brought him to me have i need of mad men that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence shall this fellow come into my house david therefore departed thence and escaped to the cave adullam and when his brethren and all his fathers house heard it they went down thither to him and every one that was in distress and every one that was in debt and every one that was discontented gathered themselves unto him and he became a captain over them and there were with him about four hundred men and david went thence to mizpeh of moab and he said unto the king of moab let my father and my mother i pray thee come forth and be with you till i know what god will do for me and he brought them before the king of moab and they dwelt with him all the while that david was in the hold and the prophet gad said unto david abide not in the hold depart and get thee into the land of judah then david departed and came into the forest of hareth when saul heard that david was discovered and the men that were with him now saul abode in gibeah under a tree in ramah having his spear in his hand and all his servants were standing about him then saul said unto his servants that stood about him hear now ye benjamites will the son of jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards and make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds that all of you have conspired against me and there is none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of jesse and there is none of you that is sorry for me or sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me to lie in wait as at this day then answered doeg the edomite which was set over the servants of saul and said i saw the son of jesse coming to nob to ahimelech the son of ahitub and he enquired of the lord for him and gave him victuals and gave him the sword of goliath the philistine then the king sent to call ahimelech the priest the son of ahitub and all his fathers house the priests that were in nob and they came all of them to the king and saul said hear now thou son of ahitub and he answered here i am my lord and saul said unto him why have ye conspired against me thou and the son of jesse in that thou hast given him bread and a sword and hast enquired of god for him that he should rise against me to lie in wait as at this day then ahimelech answered the king and said and who is so faithful among all thy servants as david which is the kings son in law and goeth at thy bidding and is honourable in thine house did i then begin to enquire of god for him be it far from me let not the king impute any thing unto his servant nor to all the house of my father for thy servant knew nothing of all this less or more and the king said thou shalt surely die ahimelech thou and all thy fathers house and the king said unto the footmen that stood about him turn and slay the priests of the lord because their hand also is with david and because they knew when he fled and did not shew it to me but the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the lord and the king said to doeg turn thou and fall upon the priests and doeg the edomite turned and he fell upon the priests and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod and nob the city of the priests smote he with the edge of the sword both men and women children and sucklings and oxen and asses and sheep with the edge of the sword and one of the sons of ahimelech the son of ahitub named abiathar escaped and fled after david and abiathar shewed david that saul had slain the
