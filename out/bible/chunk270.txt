kidron and carried the ashes of them unto bethel and he put down the idolatrous priests whom the kings of judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of judah and in the places round about jerusalem them also that burned incense unto baal to the sun and to the moon and to the planets and to all the host of heaven and he brought out the grove from the house of the lord without jerusalem unto the brook kidron and burned it at the brook kidron and stamped it small to powder and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people and he brake down the houses of the sodomites that were by the house of the lord where the women wove hangings for the grove and he brought all the priests out of the cities of judah and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense from geba to beersheba and brake down the high places of the gates that were in the entering in of the gate of joshua the governor of the city which were on a mans left hand at the gate of the city nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the lord in jerusalem but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brethren and he defiled topheth which is in the valley of the children of hinnom that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to molech and he took away the horses that the kings of judah had given to the sun at the entering in of the house of the lord by the chamber of nathanmelech the chamberlain which was in the suburbs and burned the chariots of the sun with fire and the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of ahaz which the kings of judah had made and the altars which manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the lord did the king beat down and brake them down from thence and cast the dust of them into the brook kidron and the high places that were before jerusalem which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption which solomon the king of israel had builded for ashtoreth the abomination of the zidonians and for chemosh the abomination of the moabites and for milcom the abomination of the children of ammon did the king defile and he brake in pieces the images and cut down the groves and filled their places with the bones of men moreover the altar that was at bethel and the high place which jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel to sin had made both that altar and the high place he brake down and burned the high place and stamped it small to powder and burned the grove and as josiah turned himself he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount and sent and took the bones out of the sepulchres and burned them upon the altar and polluted it according to the word of the lord which the man of god proclaimed who proclaimed these words then he said what title is that that i see and the men of the city told him it is the sepulchre of the man of god which came from judah and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of bethel and he said let him alone let no man move his bones so they let his bones alone with the bones of the prophet that came out of samaria and all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of samaria which the kings of israel had made to provoke the lord to anger josiah took away and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in bethel and he slew all the priests of the high places that were there upon the altars and burned mens bones upon them and returned to jerusalem and the king commanded all the people saying keep the passover unto the lord your god as it is written in the book of this covenant surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged israel nor in all the days of the kings of israel nor of the kings of judah but in the eighteenth year of king josiah wherein this passover was holden to the lord in jerusalem moreover the workers with familiar spirits and the wizards and the images and the idols and all the abominations that were spied in the land of judah and in jerusalem did josiah put away that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that hilkiah the priest found in the house of the lord and like unto him was there no king before him that turned to the lord with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his might according to all the law of moses neither after him arose there any like him notwithstanding the lord turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath wherewith his anger was kindled against judah because of all the provocations that manasseh had provoked him withal and the lord said i will remove judah also out of my sight as i have removed israel and will cast off this city jerusalem which i have chosen and the house of which i said my name shall be there now the rest of the acts of josiah and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah in his days pharaohnechoh
