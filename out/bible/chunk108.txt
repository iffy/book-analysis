the place hormah and they journeyed from mount hor by the way of the red sea to compass the land of edom and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way and the people spake against god and against moses wherefore have ye brought us up out of egypt to die in the wilderness for there is no bread neither is there any water and our soul loatheth this light bread and the lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people and much people of israel died therefore the people came to moses and said we have sinned for we have spoken against the lord and against thee pray unto the lord that he take away the serpents from us and moses prayed for the people and the lord said unto moses make thee a fiery serpent and set it upon a pole and it shall come to pass that every one that is bitten when he looketh upon it shall live and moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he beheld the serpent of brass he lived and the children of israel set forward and pitched in oboth and they journeyed from oboth and pitched at ijeabarim in the wilderness which is before moab toward the sunrising from thence they removed and pitched in the valley of zared from thence they removed and pitched on the other side of arnon which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the amorites for arnon is the border of moab between moab and the amorites wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the lord what he did in the red sea and in the brooks of arnon and at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of ar and lieth upon the border of moab and from thence they went to beer that is the well whereof the lord spake unto moses gather the people together and i will give them water then israel sang this song spring up o well sing ye unto it the princes digged the well the nobles of the people digged it by the direction of the lawgiver with their staves and from the wilderness they went to mattanah and from mattanah to nahaliel and from nahaliel to bamoth and from bamoth in the valley that is in the country of moab to the top of pisgah which looketh toward jeshimon and israel sent messengers unto sihon king of the amorites saying let me pass through thy land we will not turn into the fields or into the vineyards we will not drink of the waters of the well but we will go along by the kings high way until we be past thy borders and sihon would not suffer israel to pass through his border but sihon gathered all his people together and went out against israel into the wilderness and he came to jahaz and fought against israel and israel smote him with the edge of the sword and possessed his land from arnon unto jabbok even unto the children of ammon for the border of the children of ammon was strong and israel took all these cities and israel dwelt in all the cities of the amorites in heshbon and in all the villages thereof for heshbon was the city of sihon the king of the amorites who had fought against the former king of moab and taken all his land out of his hand even unto arnon wherefore they that speak in proverbs say come into heshbon let the city of sihon be built and prepared for there is a fire gone out of heshbon a flame from the city of sihon it hath consumed ar of moab and the lords of the high places of arnon woe to thee moab thou art undone o people of chemosh he hath given his sons that escaped and his daughters into captivity unto sihon king of the amorites we have shot at them heshbon is perished even unto dibon and we have laid them waste even unto nophah which reacheth unto medeba thus israel dwelt in the land of the amorites and moses sent to spy out jaazer and they took the villages thereof and drove out the amorites that were there and they turned and went up by the way of bashan and og the king of bashan went out against them he and all his people to the battle at edrei and the lord said unto moses fear him not for i have delivered him into thy hand and all his people and his land and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto sihon king of the amorites which dwelt at heshbon so they smote him and his sons and all his people until there was none left him alive and they possessed his land and the children of israel set forward and pitched in the plains of moab on this side jordan by jericho and balak the son of zippor saw all that israel had done to the amorites and moab was sore afraid of the people because they were many and moab was distressed because of the children of israel and moab said unto the elders of midian now shall this company lick up all that are round about us as the ox licketh up the grass of the field and balak the son of zippor was king of the moabites at that time he sent messengers therefore unto balaam the son of beor to pethor which is by the river of the land of the children of his people to call him saying behold there is a people come out from egypt behold they cover the face of the earth and they abide over against me come now therefore i pray thee curse me this people for they are too mighty for me peradventure i shall prevail that we may smite them and that i may drive them out of the land for i wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed and he whom thou cursest is cursed and the elders of moab and the elders of midian departed with the rewards of divination in their
