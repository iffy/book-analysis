did wash the inwards and the legs and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar and he brought the peoples offering and took the goat which was the sin offering for the people and slew it and offered it for sin as the first and he brought the burnt offering and offered it according to the manner and he brought the meat offering and took an handful thereof and burnt it upon the altar beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning he slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings which was for the people and aarons sons presented unto him the blood which he sprinkled upon the altar round about and the fat of the bullock and of the ram the rump and that which covereth the inwards and the kidneys and the caul above the liver and they put the fat upon the breasts and he burnt the fat upon the altar and the breasts and the right shoulder aaron waved for a wave offering before the lord as moses commanded and aaron lifted up his hand toward the people and blessed them and came down from offering of the sin offering and the burnt offering and peace offerings and moses and aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation and came out and blessed the people and the glory of the lord appeared unto all the people and there came a fire out from before the lord and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat which when all the people saw they shouted and fell on their faces and nadab and abihu the sons of aaron took either of them his censer and put fire therein and put incense thereon and offered strange fire before the lord which he commanded them not and there went out fire from the lord and devoured them and they died before the lord then moses said unto aaron this is it that the lord spake saying i will be sanctified in them that come nigh me and before all the people i will be glorified and aaron held his peace and moses called mishael and elzaphan the sons of uzziel the uncle of aaron and said unto them come near carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp so they went near and carried them in their coats out of the camp as moses had said and moses said unto aaron and unto eleazar and unto ithamar his sons uncover not your heads neither rend your clothes lest ye die and lest wrath come upon all the people but let your brethren the whole house of israel bewail the burning which the lord hath kindled and ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation lest ye die for the anointing oil of the lord is upon you and they did according to the word of moses and the lord spake unto aaron saying do not drink wine nor strong drink thou nor thy sons with thee when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation lest ye die it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations and that ye may put difference between holy and unholy and between unclean and clean and that ye may teach the children of israel all the statutes which the lord hath spoken unto them by the hand of moses and moses spake unto aaron and unto eleazar and unto ithamar his sons that were left take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the lord made by fire and eat it without leaven beside the altar for it is most holy and ye shall eat it in the holy place because it is thy due and thy sons due of the sacrifices of the lord made by fire for so i am commanded and the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place thou and thy sons and thy daughters with thee for they be thy due and thy sons due which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of israel the heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat to wave it for a wave offering before the lord and it shall be thine and thy sons with thee by a statute for ever as the lord hath commanded and moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering and behold it was burnt and he was angry with eleazar and ithamar the sons of aaron which were left alive saying wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place seeing it is most holy and god hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation to make atonement for them before the lord behold the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place as i commanded and aaron said unto moses behold this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the lord and such things have befallen me and if i had eaten the sin offering to day should it have been accepted in the sight of the lord and when moses heard that he was content and the lord spake unto moses and to aaron saying unto them speak unto the children of israel saying these are the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth whatsoever parteth the hoof and is clovenfooted and cheweth the cud among the beasts that shall ye eat nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud or of them that divide the hoof as the camel because he cheweth the cud but divideth not the hoof he is unclean unto you and the coney because he cheweth the cud but divideth not the hoof he is unclean unto you and the hare because he cheweth the cud but divideth not the hoof he is unclean unto you and the swine though he divide the hoof and be clovenfooted yet he cheweth not the cud he is unclean to you of their flesh shall ye not eat and their carcase shall ye not touch they are unclean to you these shall
