pitched on the other side of arnon but came not within the border of moab for arnon was the border of moab and israel sent messengers unto sihon king of the amorites the king of heshbon and israel said unto him let us pass we pray thee through thy land into my place but sihon trusted not israel to pass through his coast but sihon gathered all his people together and pitched in jahaz and fought against israel and the lord god of israel delivered sihon and all his people into the hand of israel and they smote them so israel possessed all the land of the amorites the inhabitants of that country and they possessed all the coasts of the amorites from arnon even unto jabbok and from the wilderness even unto jordan so now the lord god of israel hath dispossessed the amorites from before his people israel and shouldest thou possess it wilt not thou possess that which chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess so whomsoever the lord our god shall drive out from before us them will we possess and now art thou any thing better than balak the son of zippor king of moab did he ever strive against israel or did he ever fight against them while israel dwelt in heshbon and her towns and in aroer and her towns and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of arnon three hundred years why therefore did ye not recover them within that time wherefore i have not sinned against thee but thou doest me wrong to war against me the lord the judge be judge this day between the children of israel and the children of ammon howbeit the king of the children of ammon hearkened not unto the words of jephthah which he sent him then the spirit of the lord came upon jephthah and he passed over gilead and manasseh and passed over mizpeh of gilead and from mizpeh of gilead he passed over unto the children of ammon and jephthah vowed a vow unto the lord and said if thou shalt without fail deliver the children of ammon into mine hands then it shall be that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me when i return in peace from the children of ammon shall surely be the lords and i will offer it up for a burnt offering so jephthah passed over unto the children of ammon to fight against them and the lord delivered them into his hands and he smote them from aroer even till thou come to minnith even twenty cities and unto the plain of the vineyards with a very great slaughter thus the children of ammon were subdued before the children of israel and jephthah came to mizpeh unto his house and behold his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances and she was his only child beside her he had neither son nor daughter and it came to pass when he saw her that he rent his clothes and said alas my daughter thou hast brought me very low and thou art one of them that trouble me for i have opened my mouth unto the lord and i cannot go back and she said unto him my father if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the lord do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth forasmuch as the lord hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies even of the children of ammon and she said unto her father let this thing be done for me let me alone two months that i may go up and down upon the mountains and bewail my virginity i and my fellows and he said go and he sent her away for two months and she went with her companions and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains and it came to pass at the end of two months that she returned unto her father who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed and she knew no man and it was a custom in israel that the daughters of israel went yearly to lament the daughter of jephthah the gileadite four days in a year and the men of ephraim gathered themselves together and went northward and said unto jephthah wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of ammon and didst not call us to go with thee we will burn thine house upon thee with fire and jephthah said unto them i and my people were at great strife with the children of ammon and when i called you ye delivered me not out of their hands and when i saw that ye delivered me not i put my life in my hands and passed over against the children of ammon and the lord delivered them into my hand wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day to fight against me then jephthah gathered together all the men of gilead and fought with ephraim and the men of gilead smote ephraim because they said ye gileadites are fugitives of ephraim among the ephraimites and among the manassites and the gileadites took the passages of jordan before the ephraimites and it was so that when those ephraimites which were escaped said let me go over that the men of gilead said unto him art thou an ephraimite if he said nay then said they unto him say now shibboleth and he said sibboleth for he could not frame to pronounce it right then they took him and slew him at the passages of jordan and there fell at that time of the ephraimites forty and two thousand and jephthah judged israel six years then died jephthah the gileadite and was buried in one of the cities of gilead and after him ibzan of bethlehem judged israel and he had thirty sons and thirty daughters whom he sent abroad and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons and he judged israel seven years then died ibzan and was buried at bethlehem and after him elon a zebulonite judged israel and he judged israel ten years and elon the zebulonite died and was buried in aijalon in the country of zebulun and after him abdon the son of hillel a
