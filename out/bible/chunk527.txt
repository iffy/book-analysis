long twelve broad square in the four squares thereof and the settle shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad in the four squares thereof and the border about it shall be half a cubit and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit about and his stairs shall look toward the east and he said unto me son of man thus saith the lord god these are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it to offer burnt offerings thereon and to sprinkle blood thereon and thou shalt give to the priests the levites that be of the seed of zadok which approach unto me to minister unto me saith the lord god a young bullock for a sin offering and thou shalt take of the blood thereof and put it on the four horns of it and on the four corners of the settle and upon the border round about thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house without the sanctuary and on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering and they shall cleanse the altar as they did cleanse it with the bullock when thou hast made an end of cleansing it thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish and a ram out of the flock without blemish and thou shalt offer them before the lord and the priests shall cast salt upon them and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering unto the lord seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin offering they shall also prepare a young bullock and a ram out of the flock without blemish seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it and they shall consecrate themselves and when these days are expired it shall be that upon the eighth day and so forward the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar and your peace offerings and i will accept you saith the lord god then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looketh toward the east and it was shut then said the lord unto me this gate shall be shut it shall not be opened and no man shall enter in by it because the lord the god of israel hath entered in by it therefore it shall be shut it is for the prince the prince he shall sit in it to eat bread before the lord he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate and shall go out by the way of the same then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house and i looked and behold the glory of the lord filled the house of the lord and i fell upon my face and the lord said unto me son of man mark well and behold with thine eyes and hear with thine ears all that i say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the lord and all the laws thereof and mark well the entering in of the house with every going forth of the sanctuary and thou shalt say to the rebellious even to the house of israel thus saith the lord god o ye house of israel let it suffice you of all your abominations in that ye have brought into my sanctuary strangers uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh to be in my sanctuary to pollute it even my house when ye offer my bread the fat and the blood and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations and ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves thus saith the lord god no stranger uncircumcised in heart nor uncircumcised in flesh shall enter into my sanctuary of any stranger that is among the children of israel and the levites that are gone away far from me when israel went astray which went astray away from me after their idols they shall even bear their iniquity yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary having charge at the gates of the house and ministering to the house they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people and they shall stand before them to minister unto them because they ministered unto them before their idols and caused the house of israel to fall into iniquity therefore have i lifted up mine hand against them saith the lord god and they shall bear their iniquity and they shall not come near unto me to do the office of a priest unto me nor to come near to any of my holy things in the most holy place but they shall bear their shame and their abominations which they have committed but i will make them keepers of the charge of the house for all the service thereof and for all that shall be done therein but the priests the levites the sons of zadok that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of israel went astray from me they shall come near to me to minister unto me and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood saith the lord god they shall enter into my sanctuary and they shall come near to my table to minister unto me and they shall keep my charge and it shall come to pass that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court they shall be clothed with linen garments and no wool shall come upon them whiles they minister in the gates of the inner court and within they shall have linen bonnets upon their heads and shall have linen breeches upon their loins they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat and when they go forth into the utter court even into the utter court to the people they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered and lay them in the holy chambers and they shall put on other garments and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments neither
