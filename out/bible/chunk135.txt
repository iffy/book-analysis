unto thy fathers if thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them which i command thee this day to love the lord thy god and to walk ever in his ways then shalt thou add three cities more for thee beside these three that innocent blood be not shed in thy land which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance and so blood be upon thee but if any man hate his neighbour and lie in wait for him and rise up against him and smite him mortally that he die and fleeth into one of these cities then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood that he may die thine eye shall not pity him but thou shalt put away the guilt of innocent blood from israel that it may go well with thee thou shalt not remove thy neighbours landmark which they of old time have set in thine inheritance which thou shalt inherit in the land that the lord thy god giveth thee to possess it one witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity or for any sin in any sin that he sinneth at the mouth of two witnesses or at the mouth of three witnesses shall the matter be established if a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong then both the men between whom the controversy is shall stand before the lord before the priests and the judges which shall be in those days and the judges shall make diligent inquisition and behold if the witness be a false witness and hath testified falsely against his brother then shall ye do unto him as he had thought to have done unto his brother so shalt thou put the evil away from among you and those which remain shall hear and fear and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you and thine eye shall not pity but life shall go for life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot when thou goest out to battle against thine enemies and seest horses and chariots and a people more than thou be not afraid of them for the lord thy god is with thee which brought thee up out of the land of egypt and it shall be when ye are come nigh unto the battle that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people and shall say unto them hear o israel ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies let not your hearts faint fear not and do not tremble neither be ye terrified because of them for the lord your god is he that goeth with you to fight for you against your enemies to save you and the officers shall speak unto the people saying what man is there that hath built a new house and hath not dedicated it let him go and return to his house lest he die in the battle and another man dedicate it and what man is he that hath planted a vineyard and hath not yet eaten of it let him also go and return unto his house lest he die in the battle and another man eat of it and what man is there that hath betrothed a wife and hath not taken her let him go and return unto his house lest he die in the battle and another man take her and the officers shall speak further unto the people and they shall say what man is there that is fearful and fainthearted let him go and return unto his house lest his brethrens heart faint as well as his heart and it shall be when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people when thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it then proclaim peace unto it and it shall be if it make thee answer of peace and open unto thee then it shall be that all the people that is found therein shall be tributaries unto thee and they shall serve thee and if it will make no peace with thee but will make war against thee then thou shalt besiege it and when the lord thy god hath delivered it into thine hands thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword but the women and the little ones and the cattle and all that is in the city even all the spoil thereof shalt thou take unto thyself and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies which the lord thy god hath given thee thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee which are not of the cities of these nations but of the cities of these people which the lord thy god doth give thee for an inheritance thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth but thou shalt utterly destroy them namely the hittites and the amorites the canaanites and the perizzites the hivites and the jebusites as the lord thy god hath commanded thee that they teach you not to do after all their abominations which they have done unto their gods so should ye sin against the lord your god when thou shalt besiege a city a long time in making war against it to take it thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them for thou mayest eat of them and thou shalt not cut them down for the tree of the field is mans life to employ them in the siege only the trees which thou knowest that they be not trees for meat thou shalt destroy and cut them down and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee until it be subdued if one be found slain in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee to possess it lying in the field and it be not known who hath slain him then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain and it shall be that
