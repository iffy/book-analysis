besieged samaria and warred against it and he sent messengers to ahab king of israel into the city and said unto him thus saith benhadad thy silver and thy gold is mine thy wives also and thy children even the goodliest are mine and the king of israel answered and said my lord o king according to thy saying i am thine and all that i have and the messengers came again and said thus speaketh benhadad saying although i have sent unto thee saying thou shalt deliver me thy silver and thy gold and thy wives and thy children yet i will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time and they shall search thine house and the houses of thy servants and it shall be that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes they shall put it in their hand and take it away then the king of israel called all the elders of the land and said mark i pray you and see how this man seeketh mischief for he sent unto me for my wives and for my children and for my silver and for my gold and i denied him not and all the elders and all the people said unto him hearken not unto him nor consent wherefore he said unto the messengers of benhadad tell my lord the king all that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first i will do but this thing i may not do and the messengers departed and brought him word again and benhadad sent unto him and said the gods do so unto me and more also if the dust of samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me and the king of israel answered and said tell him let not him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off and it came to pass when ben-hadad heard this message as he was drinking he and the kings in the pavilions that he said unto his servants set yourselves in array and they set themselves in array against the city and behold there came a prophet unto ahab king of israel saying thus saith the lord hast thou seen all this great multitude behold i will deliver it into thine hand this day and thou shalt know that i am the lord and ahab said by whom and he said thus saith the lord even by the young men of the princes of the provinces then he said who shall order the battle and he answered thou then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces and they were two hundred and thirty two and after them he numbered all the people even all the children of israel being seven thousand and they went out at noon but benhadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions he and the kings the thirty and two kings that helped him and the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first and benhadad sent out and they told him saying there are men come out of samaria and he said whether they be come out for peace take them alive or whether they be come out for war take them alive so these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city and the army which followed them and they slew every one his man and the syrians fled and israel pursued them and benhadad the king of syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen and the king of israel went out and smote the horses and chariots and slew the syrians with a great slaughter and the prophet came to the king of israel and said unto him go strengthen thyself and mark and see what thou doest for at the return of the year the king of syria will come up against thee and the servants of the king of syria said unto him their gods are gods of the hills therefore they were stronger than we but let us fight against them in the plain and surely we shall be stronger than they and do this thing take the kings away every man out of his place and put captains in their rooms and number thee an army like the army that thou hast lost horse for horse and chariot for chariot and we will fight against them in the plain and surely we shall be stronger than they and he hearkened unto their voice and did so and it came to pass at the return of the year that benhadad numbered the syrians and went up to aphek to fight against israel and the children of israel were numbered and were all present and went against them and the children of israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids but the syrians filled the country and there came a man of god and spake unto the king of israel and said thus saith the lord because the syrians have said the lord is god of the hills but he is not god of the valleys therefore will i deliver all this great multitude into thine hand and ye shall know that i am the lord and they pitched one over against the other seven days and so it was that in the seventh day the battle was joined and the children of israel slew of the syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day but the rest fled to aphek into the city and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left and benhadad fled and came into the city into an inner chamber and his servants said unto him behold now we have heard that the kings of the house of israel are merciful kings let us i pray thee put sackcloth on our loins and ropes upon our heads and go out to the king of israel peradventure he will save thy life so they girded sackcloth on their loins and put ropes on their heads and came to the king of israel and said thy servant benhadad saith i pray thee let me live and he said is he yet alive he is my brother now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come from him
