in him but now because it is not so he hath visited in his anger yet he knoweth it not in great extremity therefore doth job open his mouth in vain he multiplieth words without knowledge elihu also proceeded and said suffer me a little and i will shew thee that i have yet to speak on gods behalf i will fetch my knowledge from afar and will ascribe righteousness to my maker for truly my words shall not be false he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee behold god is mighty and despiseth not any he is mighty in strength and wisdom he preserveth not the life of the wicked but giveth right to the poor he withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous but with kings are they on the throne yea he doth establish them for ever and they are exalted and if they be bound in fetters and be holden in cords of affliction then he sheweth them their work and their transgressions that they have exceeded he openeth also their ear to discipline and commandeth that they return from iniquity if they obey and serve him they shall spend their days in prosperity and their years in pleasures but if they obey not they shall perish by the sword and they shall die without knowledge but the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath they cry not when he bindeth them they die in youth and their life is among the unclean he delivereth the poor in his affliction and openeth their ears in oppression even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place where there is no straitness and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness but thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked judgment and justice take hold on thee because there is wrath beware lest he take thee away with his stroke then a great ransom cannot deliver thee will he esteem thy riches no not gold nor all the forces of strength desire not the night when people are cut off in their place take heed regard not iniquity for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction behold god exalteth by his power who teacheth like him who hath enjoined him his way or who can say thou hast wrought iniquity remember that thou magnify his work which men behold every man may see it man may behold it afar off behold god is great and we know him not neither can the number of his years be searched out for he maketh small the drops of water they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds or the noise of his tabernacle behold he spreadeth his light upon it and covereth the bottom of the sea for by them judgeth he the people he giveth meat in abundance with clouds he covereth the light and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt the noise thereof sheweth concerning it the cattle also concerning the vapour at this also my heart trembleth and is moved out of his place hear attentively the noise of his voice and the sound that goeth out of his mouth he directeth it under the whole heaven and his lightning unto the ends of the earth after it a voice roareth he thundereth with the voice of his excellency and he will not stay them when his voice is heard god thundereth marvellously with his voice great things doeth he which we cannot comprehend for he saith to the snow be thou on the earth likewise to the small rain and to the great rain of his strength he sealeth up the hand of every man that all men may know his work then the beasts go into dens and remain in their places out of the south cometh the whirlwind and cold out of the north by the breath of god frost is given and the breadth of the waters is straitened also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud he scattereth his bright cloud and it is turned round about by his counsels that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth he causeth it to come whether for correction or for his land or for mercy hearken unto this o job stand still and consider the wondrous works of god dost thou know when god disposed them and caused the light of his cloud to shine dost thou know the balancings of the clouds the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge how thy garments are warm when he quieteth the earth by the south wind hast thou with him spread out the sky which is strong and as a molten looking glass teach us what we shall say unto him for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness shall it be told him that i speak if a man speak surely he shall be swallowed up and now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds but the wind passeth and cleanseth them fair weather cometh out of the north with god is terrible majesty touching the almighty we cannot find him out he is excellent in power and in judgment and in plenty of justice he will not afflict men do therefore fear him he respecteth not any that are wise of heart then the lord answered job out of the whirlwind and said who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge gird up now thy loins like a man for i will demand of thee and answer thou me where wast thou when i laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou hast understanding who hath laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who hath stretched the line upon it whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened or who laid the corner stone thereof when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of god shouted for joy or who shut up the sea with doors when it brake forth as if it had issued out of the womb when i made the cloud the garment thereof and thick darkness a swaddlingband for
