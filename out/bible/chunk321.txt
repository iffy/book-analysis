river that runneth to ahava and there abode we in tents three days and i viewed the people and the priests and found there none of the sons of levi then sent i for eliezer for ariel for shemaiah and for elnathan and for jarib and for elnathan and for nathan and for zechariah and for meshullam chief men also for joiarib and for elnathan men of understanding and i sent them with commandment unto iddo the chief at the place casiphia and i told them what they should say unto iddo and to his brethren the nethinims at the place casiphia that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our god and by the good hand of our god upon us they brought us a man of understanding of the sons of mahli the son of levi the son of israel and sherebiah with his sons and his brethren eighteen and hashabiah and with him jeshaiah of the sons of merari his brethren and their sons twenty also of the nethinims whom david and the princes had appointed for the service of the levites two hundred and twenty nethinims all of them were expressed by name then i proclaimed a fast there at the river of ahava that we might afflict ourselves before our god to seek of him a right way for us and for our little ones and for all our substance for i was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way because we had spoken unto the king saying the hand of our god is upon all them for good that seek him but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him so we fasted and besought our god for this and he was intreated of us then i separated twelve of the chief of the priests sherebiah hashabiah and ten of their brethren with them and weighed unto them the silver and the gold and the vessels even the offering of the house of our god which the king and his counsellors and his lords and all israel there present had offered i even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver and silver vessels an hundred talents and of gold an hundred talents also twenty basons of gold of a thousand drams and two vessels of fine copper precious as gold and i said unto them ye are holy unto the lord the vessels are holy also and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the lord god of your fathers watch ye and keep them until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests and the levites and chief of the fathers of israel at jerusalem in the chambers of the house of the lord so took the priests and the levites the weight of the silver and the gold and the vessels to bring them to jerusalem unto the house of our god then we departed from the river of ahava on the twelfth day of the first month to go unto jerusalem and the hand of our god was upon us and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and of such as lay in wait by the way and we came to jerusalem and abode there three days now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our god by the hand of meremoth the son of uriah the priest and with him was eleazar the son of phinehas and with them was jozabad the son of jeshua and noadiah the son of binnui levites by number and by weight of every one and all the weight was written at that time also the children of those that had been carried away which were come out of the captivity offered burnt offerings unto the god of israel twelve bullocks for all israel ninety and six rams seventy and seven lambs twelve he goats for a sin offering all this was a burnt offering unto the lord and they delivered the kings commissions unto the kings lieutenants and to the governors on this side the river and they furthered the people and the house of god now when these things were done the princes came to me saying the people of israel and the priests and the levites have not separated themselves from the people of the lands doing according to their abominations even of the canaanites the hittites the perizzites the jebusites the ammonites the moabites the egyptians and the amorites for they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands yea the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass and when i heard this thing i rent my garment and my mantle and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard and sat down astonied then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the god of israel because of the transgression of those that had been carried away and i sat astonied until the evening sacrifice and at the evening sacrifice i arose up from my heaviness and having rent my garment and my mantle i fell upon my knees and spread out my hands unto the lord my god and said o my god i am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee my god for our iniquities are increased over our head and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass unto this day and for our iniquities have we our kings and our priests been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands to the sword to captivity and to a spoil and to confusion of face as it is this day and now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the lord our god to leave us a remnant to escape and to give us a nail in his holy place that our god may lighten our eyes and give us a little reviving in our bondage for we were bondmen yet our
