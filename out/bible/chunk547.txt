locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten awake ye drunkards and weep and howl all ye drinkers of wine because of the new wine for

ye ashamed o ye husbandmen howl o ye vinedressers for the wheat and for the barley because the harvest of the field is perished the vine is dried up and the fig tree languisheth the pomegranate tree

pastures of the wilderness and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field the beasts of the field cry also unto thee for the rivers of waters are dried up and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness blow ye the trumpet in zion and sound an alarm in my holy mountain let all the inhabitants of the land tremble for the day of the lord cometh for it is nigh at hand a day of darkness and of gloominess a day of clouds and of thick darkness as the morning spread upon the mountains a great people and a strong there hath not been ever the like neither shall be any more after it even

escape them the appearance of them is as the appearance of horses and as horsemen so shall they run like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble
