suffer thine holy one to see corruption for david after he had served his own generation by the will of god fell on sleep and was laid unto his fathers and saw corruption but he whom god raised again saw no corruption be it known unto you therefore men and brethren that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins and by him all that believe are justified from all things from which ye could not be justified by the law of moses beware therefore lest that come upon you which is spoken of in the prophets behold ye despisers and wonder and perish for i work a work in your days a work which ye shall in no wise believe though a man declare it unto you and when the jews were gone out of the synagogue the gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath now when the congregation was broken up many of the jews and religious proselytes followed paul and barnabas who speaking to them persuaded them to continue in the grace of god and the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of god but when the jews saw the multitudes they were filled with envy and spake against those things which were spoken by paul contradicting and blaspheming then paul and barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to you but seeing ye put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life lo we turn to the gentiles for so hath the lord commanded us saying i have set thee to be a light of the gentiles that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth and when the gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed and the word of the lord was published throughout all the region but the jews stirred up the devout and honourable women and the chief men of the city and raised persecution against paul and barnabas and expelled them out of their coasts but they shook off the dust of their feet against them and came unto iconium and the disciples were filled with joy and with the holy ghost and it came to pass in iconium that they went both together into the synagogue of the jews and so spake that a great multitude both of the jews and also of the greeks believed but the unbelieving jews stirred up the gentiles and made their minds evil affected against the brethren long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the lord which gave testimony unto the word of his grace and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands but the multitude of the city was divided and part held with the jews and part with the apostles and when there was an assault made both of the gentiles and also of the jews with their rulers to use them despitefully and to stone them they were ware of it and fled unto lystra and derbe cities of lycaonia and unto the region that lieth round about and there they preached the gospel and there sat a certain man at lystra impotent in his feet being a cripple from his mothers womb who never had walked the same heard paul speak who stedfastly beholding him and perceiving that he had faith to be healed said with a loud voice stand upright on thy feet and he leaped and walked and when the people saw what paul had done they lifted up their voices saying in the speech of lycaonia the gods are come down to us in the likeness of men and they called barnabas jupiter and paul mercurius because he was the chief speaker then the priest of jupiter which was before their city brought oxen and garlands unto the gates and would have done sacrifice with the people which when the apostles barnabas and paul heard of they rent their clothes and ran in among the people crying out and saying sirs why do ye these things we also are men of like passions with you and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living god which made heaven and earth and the sea and all things that are therein who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways nevertheless he left not himself without witness in that he did good and gave us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons filling our hearts with food and gladness and with these sayings scarce restrained they the people that they had not done sacrifice unto them and there came thither certain jews from antioch and iconium who persuaded the people and having stoned paul drew him out of the city supposing he had been dead howbeit as the disciples stood round about him he rose up and came into the city and the next day he departed with barnabas to derbe and when they had preached the gospel to that city and had taught many they returned again to lystra and to iconium and antioch confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of god and when they had ordained them elders in every church and had prayed with fasting they commended them to the lord on whom they believed and after they had passed throughout pisidia they came to pamphylia and when they had preached the word in perga they went down into attalia and thence sailed to antioch from whence they had been recommended to the grace of god for the work which they fulfilled and when they were come and had gathered the church together they rehearsed all that god had done with them and how he had opened the door of faith unto the gentiles and there they abode long time with the disciples and certain men which came down from judaea taught the brethren and said except ye be circumcised after the manner of moses ye cannot be saved when therefore paul and barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them they determined that paul
