long and he answered until the cities be wasted without inhabitant and the houses without man and the land be utterly desolate and the lord have removed men far away and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land but yet in it shall be a tenth and it shall return and shall be eaten as a teil tree and as an oak whose substance is in them when they cast their leaves so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof and it came to pass in the days of ahaz the son of jotham the son of uzziah king of judah that rezin the king of syria and pekah the son of remaliah king of israel went up toward jerusalem to war against it but could not prevail against it and it was told the house of david saying syria is confederate with ephraim and his heart was moved and the heart of his people as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind then said the lord unto isaiah go forth now to meet ahaz thou and shearjashub thy son at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fullers field and say unto him take heed and be quiet fear not neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands for the fierce anger of rezin with syria and of the son of remaliah because syria ephraim and the son of remaliah have taken evil counsel against thee saying let us go up against judah and vex it and let us make a breach therein for us and set a king in the midst of it even the son of tabeal thus saith the lord god it shall not stand neither shall it come to pass for the head of syria is damascus and the head of damascus is rezin and within threescore and five years shall ephraim be broken that it be not a people and the head of ephraim is samaria and the head of samaria is remaliahs son if ye will not believe surely ye shall not be established moreover the lord spake again unto ahaz saying ask thee a sign of the lord thy god ask it either in the depth or in the height above but ahaz said i will not ask neither will i tempt the lord and he said hear ye now o house of david is it a small thing for you to weary men but will ye weary my god also therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name immanuel butter and honey shall he eat that he may know to refuse the evil and choose the good for before the child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings the lord shall bring upon thee and upon thy people and upon thy fathers house days that have not come from the day that ephraim departed from judah even the king of assyria and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of egypt and for the bee that is in the land of assyria and they shall come and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys and in the holes of the rocks and upon all thorns and upon all bushes in the same day shall the lord shave with a razor that is hired namely by them beyond the river by the king of assyria the head and the hair of the feet and it shall also consume the beard and it shall come to pass in that day that a man shall nourish a young cow and two sheep and it shall come to pass for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land and it shall come to pass in that day that every place shall be where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings it shall even be for briers and thorns with arrows and with bows shall men come thither because all the land shall become briers and thorns and on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen and for the treading of lesser cattle moreover the lord said unto me take thee a great roll and write in it with a mans pen concerning mahershalalhashbaz and i took unto me faithful witnesses to record uriah the priest and zechariah the son of jeberechiah and i went unto the prophetess and she conceived and bare a son then said the lord to me call his name mahershalalhashbaz for before the child shall have knowledge to cry my father and my mother the riches of damascus and the spoil of samaria shall be taken away before the king of assyria the lord spake also unto me again saying forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of shiloah that go softly and rejoice in rezin and remaliahs son now therefore behold the lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river strong and many even the king of assyria and all his glory and he shall come up over all his channels and go over all his banks and he shall pass through judah he shall overflow and go over he shall reach even to the neck and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land o immanuel associate yourselves o ye people and ye shall be broken in pieces and give ear all ye of far countries gird yourselves and ye shall be broken in pieces gird yourselves and ye shall be broken in pieces take counsel together and it shall come to nought speak the word and it shall not stand for god is with us for the lord spake thus to me with a strong hand and instructed me that i should not walk in the way of this people saying say ye not a confederacy to all
