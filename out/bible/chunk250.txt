israel said unto jehoshaphat i will disguise myself and enter into the battle but put thou on thy robes and the king of israel disguised himself and went into the battle but the king of syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots saying fight neither with small nor great save only with the king of israel and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw jehoshaphat that they said surely it is the king of israel and they turned aside to fight against him and jehoshaphat cried out and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of israel that they turned back from pursuing him and a certain man drew a bow at a venture and smote the king of israel between the joints of the harness wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot turn thine hand and carry me out of the host for i am wounded and the battle increased that day and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the syrians and died at even and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot and there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun saying every man to his city and every man to his own country so the king died and was brought to samaria and they buried the king in samaria and one washed the chariot in the pool of samaria and the dogs licked up his blood and they washed his armour according unto the word of the lord which he spake now the rest of the acts of ahab and all that he did and the ivory house which he made and all the cities that he built are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel so ahab slept with his fathers and ahaziah his son reigned in his stead and jehoshaphat the son of asa began to reign over judah in the fourth year of ahab king of israel jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and five years in jerusalem and his mothers name was azubah the daughter of shilhi and he walked in all the ways of asa his father he turned not aside from it doing that which was right in the eyes of the lord nevertheless the high places were not taken away for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places and jehoshaphat made peace with the king of israel now the rest of the acts of jehoshaphat and his might that he shewed and how he warred are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah and the remnant of the sodomites which remained in the days of his father asa he took out of the land there was then no king in edom a deputy was king jehoshaphat made ships of tharshish to go to ophir for gold but they went not for the ships were broken at eziongeber then said ahaziah the son of ahab unto jehoshaphat let my servants go with thy servants in the ships but jehoshaphat would not and jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david his father and jehoram his son reigned in his stead ahaziah the son of ahab began to reign over israel in samaria the seventeenth year of jehoshaphat king of judah and reigned two years over israel and he did evil in the sight of the lord and walked in the way of his father and in the way of his mother and in the way of jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel to sin for he served baal and worshipped him and provoked to anger the lord god of israel according to all that his father had done the second book of the kings commonly called the fourth book of the kings then moab rebelled against israel after the death of ahab and ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in samaria and was sick and he sent messengers and said unto them go enquire of baalzebub the god of ekron whether i shall recover of this disease but the angel of the lord said to elijah the tishbite arise go up to meet the messengers of the king of samaria and say unto them is it not because there is not a god in israel that ye go to enquire of baalzebub the god of ekron now therefore thus saith the lord thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up but shalt surely die and elijah departed and when the messengers turned

fire from heaven and consumed him and his fifty again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty and he answered and said unto him o man of god thus hath
