all as an unclean thing and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags and we all do fade as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away and there is none that calleth upon thy name that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee for thou hast hid thy face from us and hast consumed us because of our iniquities but now o lord thou art our father we are the clay and thou our potter and we all are the work of thy hand be not wroth very sore o lord neither remember iniquity for ever behold see we beseech thee we are all thy people thy holy cities are a wilderness zion is a wilderness jerusalem a desolation our holy and our beautiful house where our fathers praised thee is burned up with fire and all our pleasant things are laid waste wilt thou refrain thyself for these things o lord wilt thou hold thy peace and afflict us very sore i am sought of them that asked not for me i am found of them that sought me not i said behold me behold me unto a nation that was not called by my name i have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people which walketh in a way that was not good after their own thoughts a people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face that sacrificeth in gardens and burneth incense upon altars of brick which remain among the graves and lodge in the monuments which eat swines flesh and broth of abominable things is in their vessels which say stand by thyself come not near to me for i am holier than thou these are a smoke in my nose a fire that burneth all the day behold it is written before me i will not keep silence but will recompense even recompense into their bosom your iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers together saith the lord which have burned incense upon the mountains and blasphemed me upon the hills therefore will i measure their former work into their bosom thus saith the lord as the new wine is found in the cluster and one saith destroy it not for a blessing is in it so will i do for my servants sakes that i may not destroy them all and i will bring forth a seed out of jacob and out of judah an inheritor of my mountains and mine elect shall inherit it and my servants shall dwell there and sharon shall be a fold of flocks and the valley of achor a place for the herds to lie down in for my people that have sought me but ye are they that forsake the lord that forget my holy mountain that prepare a table for that troop and that furnish the drink offering unto that number therefore will i number you to the sword and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter because when i called ye did not answer when i spake ye did not hear but did evil before mine eyes and did choose that wherein i delighted not therefore thus saith the lord god behold my servants shall eat but ye shall be hungry behold my servants shall drink but ye shall be thirsty behold my servants shall rejoice but ye shall be ashamed behold my servants shall sing for joy of heart but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart and shall howl for vexation of spirit and ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen for the lord god shall slay thee and call his servants by another name that he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the god of truth and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the god of truth because the former troubles are forgotten and because they are hid from mine eyes for behold i create new heavens and a new earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind but be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which i create for behold i create jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a joy and i will rejoice in jerusalem and joy in my people and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her nor the voice of crying there shall be no more thence an infant of days nor an old man that hath not filled his days for the child shall die an hundred years old but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed and they shall build houses and inhabit them and they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them they shall not build and another inhabit they shall not plant and another eat for as the days of a tree are the days of my people and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands they shall not labour in vain nor bring forth for trouble for they are the seed of the blessed of the lord and their offspring with them and it shall come to pass that before they call i will answer and while they are yet speaking i will hear the wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock and dust shall be the serpents meat they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain saith the lord thus saith the lord the heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool where is the house that ye build unto me and where is the place of my rest for all those things hath mine hand made and all those things have been saith the lord but to this man will i look even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit and trembleth at my word he that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man he that sacrificeth a lamb as if he cut off a dogs neck he that offereth an oblation as if he offered swines blood he that burneth incense as if he blessed an idol yea they have chosen their own ways and their soul delighteth in their abominations i also will choose their delusions and will bring their fears upon them because when
