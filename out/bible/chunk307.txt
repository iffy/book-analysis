prophet forbare and said i know that god hath determined to destroy thee because thou hast done this and hast not hearkened unto my counsel then amaziah king of judah took advice and sent to joash the son of jehoahaz the son of jehu king of israel saying come let us see one another in the face and joash king of israel sent to amaziah king of judah saying the thistle that was in lebanon sent to the cedar that was in lebanon saying give thy daughter to my son to wife and there passed by a wild beast that was in lebanon and trode down the thistle thou sayest lo thou hast smitten the edomites and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast abide now at home why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt that thou shouldest fall even thou and judah with thee but amaziah would not hear for it came of god that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies because they sought after the gods of edom so joash the king of israel went up and they saw one another in the face both he and amaziah king of judah at bethshemesh which belongeth to judah and judah was put to the worse before israel and they fled every man to his tent and joash the king of israel took amaziah king of judah the son of joash the son of jehoahaz at bethshemesh and brought him to jerusalem and brake down the wall of jerusalem from the gate of ephraim to the corner gate four hundred cubits and he took all the gold and the silver and all the vessels that were found in the house of god with obededom and the treasures of the kings house the hostages also and returned to samaria and amaziah the son of joash king of judah lived after the death of joash son of jehoahaz king of israel fifteen years now the rest of the acts of amaziah first and last behold are they not written in the book of the kings of judah and israel now after the time that amaziah did turn away from following the lord they made a conspiracy against him in jerusalem and he fled to lachish but they sent to lachish after him and slew him there and they brought him upon horses and buried him with his fathers in the city of judah then all the people of judah took uzziah who was sixteen years old and made him king in the room of his father amaziah he built eloth and restored it to judah after that the king slept with his fathers sixteen years old was uzziah when he began to reign and he reigned fifty and two years in jerusalem his mothers name also was jecoliah of jerusalem and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord according to all that his father amaziah did and he sought god in the days of zechariah who had understanding in the visions of god and as long as he sought the lord god made him to prosper and he went forth and warred against the philistines and brake down the wall of gath and the wall of jabneh and the wall of ashdod and built cities about ashdod and among the philistines and god helped him against the philistines and against the arabians that dwelt in gurbaal and the mehunims and the ammonites gave gifts to uzziah and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of egypt for he strengthened himself exceedingly moreover uzziah built towers in jerusalem at the corner gate and at the valley gate and at the turning of the wall and fortified them also he built towers in the desert and digged many wells for he had much cattle both in the low country and in the plains husbandmen also and vine dressers in the mountains and in carmel for he loved husbandry moreover uzziah had an host of fighting men that went out to war by bands according to the number of their account by the hand of jeiel the scribe and maaseiah the ruler under the hand of hananiah one of the kings captains the whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour were two thousand and six hundred and under their hand was an army three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred that made war with mighty power to help the king against the enemy and uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields and spears and helmets and habergeons and bows and slings to cast stones and he made in jerusalem engines invented by cunning men to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks to shoot arrows and great stones withal and his name spread far abroad for he was marvellously helped till he was strong but when he was strong his heart was lifted up to his destruction for he transgressed against the lord his god and went into the temple of the lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense and azariah the priest went in after him and with him fourscore priests of the lord that were valiant men and they withstood uzziah the king and said unto him it appertaineth not unto thee uzziah to burn incense unto the lord but to the priests the sons of aaron that are consecrated to burn incense go out of the sanctuary for thou hast trespassed neither shall it be for thine honour from the lord god then uzziah was wroth and had a censer in his hand to burn incense and while he was wroth with the priests the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the lord from beside the incense altar and azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked upon him and behold he was leprous in his forehead and they thrust him out from thence yea himself hasted also to go out because the lord had smitten him and uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death and dwelt in a several house being a leper for he was cut off from the house of the lord and jotham his son was over the kings house judging the people of the land now
