a year ago now therefore perform the doing of it that as there was a readiness to will so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have for if there be first a willing mind it is accepted according to that a man hath and not according to that he hath not for i mean not that other men be eased and ye burdened but by an equality that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want that their abundance also may be a supply for your want that there may be equality as it is written he that had gathered much had nothing over and he that had gathered little had no lack but thanks be to god which put the same earnest care into the heart of titus for you for indeed he accepted the exhortation but being more forward of his own accord he went unto you and we have sent with him the brother whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches and not that only but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace which is administered by us to the glory of the same lord and declaration of your ready mind avoiding this that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us providing for honest things not only in the sight of the lord but also in the sight of men and we have sent with them our brother whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things but now much more diligent upon the great confidence which i have in you whether any do enquire of titus he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you or our brethren be enquired of they are the messengers of the churches and the glory of christ wherefore shew ye to them and before the churches the proof of your love and of our boasting on your behalf for as touching the ministering to the saints it is superfluous for me to write to you for i know the forwardness of your mind for which i boast of you to them of macedonia that achaia was ready a year ago and your zeal hath provoked very many yet have i sent the brethren lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf that as i said ye may be ready lest haply if they of macedonia come with me and find you unprepared we that we say not ye should be ashamed in this same confident boasting therefore i thought it necessary to exhort the brethren that they would go before unto you and make up beforehand your bounty whereof ye had notice before that the same might be ready as a matter of bounty and not as of covetousness but this i say he which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully every man according as he purposeth in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or of necessity for god loveth a cheerful giver and god is able to make all grace abound toward you that ye always having all sufficiency in all things may abound to every good work as it is written he hath dispersed abroad he hath given to the poor his righteousness remaineth for ever now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food and multiply your seed sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness which causeth through us thanksgiving to god for the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto god whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify god for your professed subjection unto the gospel of christ and for your liberal distribution unto them and unto all men and by their prayer for you which long after you for the exceeding grace of god in you thanks be unto god for his unspeakable gift now i paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of christ who in presence am base among you but being absent am bold toward you but i beseech you that i may not be bold when i am present with that confidence wherewith i think to be bold against some which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strong holds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled do ye look on things after the outward appearance if any man trust to himself that he is christs let him of himself think this again that as he is christs even so are we christs for though i should boast somewhat more of our authority which the lord hath given us for edification and not for your destruction i should not be ashamed that i may not seem as if i would terrify you by letters for his letters say they are weighty and powerful but his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible let such an one think this that such as we are in word by letters when we are absent such will we be also in deed when we are present for we dare not make ourselves of the number or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves but they measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise but we will not boast of things without our measure but according to the measure of the rule which god hath distributed to us a measure to reach even unto you for we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure as though we reached not unto you for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of christ not boasting of things without our measure that is of other mens labours but having hope when your faith is increased that we
