door and the breadth was fifty cubits over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court and over against the pavement which was for the utter court was gallery against gallery in three stories and before the chambers was a walk to ten cubits breadth inward a way of one cubit and their doors toward the north now the upper chambers were shorter for the galleries were higher than these than the lower and than the middlemost of the building for they were in three stories but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts therefore the building was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground and the wall that was without over against the chambers toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers the length thereof was fifty cubits for the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was fifty cubits and lo before the temple were an hundred cubits and from under these chambers was the entry on the east side as one goeth into them from the utter court the chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east over against the separate place and over against the building and the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers which were toward the north as long as they and as broad as they and all their goings out were both according to their fashions and according to their doors and according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door in the head of the way even the way directly before the wall toward the east as one entereth into them then said he unto me the north chambers and the south chambers which are before the separate place they be holy chambers where the priests that approach unto the lord shall eat the most holy things there shall they lay the most holy things and the meat offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering for the place is holy when the priests enter therein then shall they not go out of the holy place into the utter court but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister for they are holy and shall put on other garments and shall approach to those things which are for the people now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east and measured it round about he measured the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about he measured the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about he measured the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed he turned about to the west side and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed he measured it by the four sides it had a wall round about five hundred reeds long and five hundred broad to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place afterward he brought me to the gate even the gate that looketh toward the east and behold the glory of the god of israel came from the way of the east and his voice was like a noise of many waters and the earth shined with his glory and it was according to the appearance of the vision which i saw even according to the vision that i saw when i came to destroy the city and the visions were like the vision that i saw by the river chebar and i fell upon my face and the glory of the lord came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east so the spirit took me up and brought me into the inner court and behold the glory of the lord filled the house and i heard him speaking unto me out of the house and the man stood by me and he said unto me son of man the place of my throne and the place of the soles of my feet where i will dwell in the midst of the children of israel for ever and my holy name shall the house of israel no more defile neither they nor their kings by their whoredom nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places in their setting of their threshold by my thresholds and their post by my posts and the wall between me and them they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed wherefore i have consumed them in mine anger now let them put away their whoredom and the carcases of their kings far from me and i will dwell in the midst of them for ever thou son of man shew the house to the house of israel that they may be ashamed of their iniquities and let them measure the pattern and if they be ashamed of all that they have done shew them the form of the house and the fashion thereof and the goings out thereof and the comings in thereof and all the forms thereof and all the ordinances thereof and all the forms thereof and all the laws thereof and write it in their sight that they may keep the whole form thereof and all the ordinances thereof and do them this is the law of the house upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy behold this is the law of the house and these are the measures of the altar after the cubits the cubit is a cubit and an hand breadth even the bottom shall be a cubit and the breadth a cubit and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about shall be a span and this shall be the higher place of the altar and from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle shall be two cubits and the breadth one cubit and from the lesser settle even to the greater settle shall be four cubits and the breadth one cubit so the altar shall be four cubits and from the altar and upward shall be four horns and the altar shall be twelve cubits
