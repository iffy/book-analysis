the earth saving that i will not utterly destroy the house of jacob saith the lord for lo i will command and i will sift the house of israel among all nations like as corn is sifted in a sieve yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth all the sinners of my people shall die by the sword which say the evil shall not overtake nor prevent us in that day will i raise up the tabernacle of david that is fallen and close up the breaches thereof and i will raise up his ruins and i will build it as in the days of old that they may possess the remnant of edom and of all the heathen which are called by my name saith the lord that doeth this behold the days come saith the lord that the plowman shall overtake the reaper and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed and the mountains shall drop sweet wine and all the hills shall melt and i will bring again the captivity of my people of israel and they shall build the waste cities and inhabit them and they shall plant vineyards and drink the wine thereof they shall also make gardens and eat the fruit of them and i will plant them upon their land and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which i have given them saith the lord thy god obadiah the vision of obadiah thus saith the lord god concerning edom we have heard a rumour from the lord and an ambassador is sent among the heathen arise ye and let us rise up against her in battle behold i have made thee small among the heathen thou art greatly despised the pride of thine heart hath deceived thee thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock whose habitation is high that saith in his heart who shall bring me down to the ground though thou exalt thyself as the eagle and though thou set thy nest among the stars thence will i bring thee down saith the lord if thieves came to thee if robbers by night how art thou cut off would they not have stolen till they had enough if the grapegatherers came to thee would they not leave some grapes how are the things of esau searched out how are his hidden things sought up all the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the border the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee and prevailed against thee that they eat thy bread have laid a wound under thee there is none understanding in him shall i not in that day saith the lord even destroy the wise men out of edom and understanding out of the mount of esau and thy mighty men o teman shall be dismayed to the end that every one of the mount of esau may be cut off by slaughter for thy violence against thy brother jacob shame shall cover thee and thou shalt be cut off for ever in the day that thou stoodest on the other side in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces and foreigners entered into his gates and cast lots upon jerusalem even thou wast as one of them but thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of judah in the day of their destruction neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the
