commanded you and have obeyed my voice in all that i commanded you ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day but have kept the charge of the commandment of the lord your god and now the lord your god hath given rest unto your brethren as he promised them therefore now return ye and get you unto your tents and unto the land of your possession which moses the servant of the lord gave you on the other side jordan but take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which moses the servant of the lord charged you to love the lord your god and to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and to cleave unto him and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul so joshua blessed them and sent them away and they went unto their tents now to the one half of the tribe of manasseh moses had given possession in bashan but unto the other half thereof gave joshua among their brethren on this side jordan westward and when joshua sent them away also unto their tents then he blessed them and he spake unto them saying return with much riches unto your tents and with very much cattle with silver and with gold and with brass and with iron and with very much raiment divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren and the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh returned and departed from the children of israel out of shiloh which is in the land of canaan to go unto the country of gilead to the land of their possession whereof they were possessed according to the word of the lord by the hand of moses and when they came unto the borders of jordan that are in the land of canaan the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh built there an altar by jordan a great altar to see to and the children of israel heard say behold the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh have built an altar over against the land of canaan in the borders of jordan at the passage of the children of israel and when the children of israel heard of it the whole congregation of the children of israel gathered themselves together at shiloh to go up to war against them and the children of israel sent unto the children of reuben and to the children of gad and to the half tribe of manasseh into the land of gilead phinehas the son of eleazar the priest and with him ten princes of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of israel and each one was an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of israel and they came unto the children of reuben and to the children of gad and to the half tribe of manasseh unto the land of gilead and they spake with them saying thus saith the whole congregation of the lord what trespass is this that ye have committed against the god of israel to turn away this day from following the lord in that ye have builded you an altar that ye might rebel this day against the lord is the iniquity of peor too little for us from which we are not cleansed until this day although there was a plague in the congregation of the lord but that ye must turn away this day from following the lord and it will be seeing ye rebel to day against the lord that to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of israel notwithstanding if the land of your possession be unclean then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the lord wherein the lords tabernacle dwelleth and take possession among us but rebel not against the lord nor rebel against us in building you an altar beside the altar of the lord our god did not achan the son of zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing and wrath fell on all the congregation of israel and that man perished not alone in his iniquity then the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh answered and said unto the heads of the thousands of israel the lord god of gods the lord god of gods he knoweth and israel he shall know if it be in rebellion or if in transgression against the lord save us not this day that we have built us an altar to turn from following the lord or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering or if to offer peace offerings thereon let the lord himself require it and if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing saying in time to come your children might speak unto our children saying what have ye to do with the lord god of israel for the lord hath made jordan a border between us and you ye children of reuben and children of gad ye have no part in the lord so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the lord therefore we said let us now prepare to build us an altar not for burnt offering nor for sacrifice but that it may be a witness between us and you and our generations after us that we might do the service of the lord before him with our burnt offerings and with our sacrifices and with our peace offerings that your children may not say to our children in time to come ye have no part in the lord therefore said we that it shall be when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come that we may say again behold the pattern of the altar of the lord which our fathers made not for burnt offerings nor for sacrifices but it is a witness between us and you god forbid that we should rebel against the lord and turn this day from following the lord to build an altar for burnt offerings for meat offerings or for sacrifices beside the altar
