all that are wise hearted i have put wisdom that they may make all that i have commanded thee the tabernacle of the congregation and the ark of the testimony and the mercy seat that is thereupon and all the furniture of the tabernacle and the table and his furniture and the pure candlestick with all his furniture and the altar of incense and the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture and the laver and his foot and the cloths of service and the holy garments for aaron the priest and the garments of his sons to minister in the priests office and the anointing oil and sweet incense for the holy place according to all that i have commanded thee shall they do and the lord spake unto moses saying speak thou also unto the children of israel saying verily my sabbaths ye shall keep for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations that ye may know that i am the lord that doth sanctify you ye shall keep the sabbath therefore for it is holy unto you every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death for whosoever doeth any work therein that soul shall be cut off from among his people six days may work be done but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest holy to the lord whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day he shall surely be put to death wherefore the children of israel shall keep the sabbath to observe the sabbath throughout their generations for a perpetual covenant it is a sign between me and the children of israel for ever for in six days the lord made heaven and earth and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed and he gave unto moses when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount sinai two tables of testimony tables of stone written with the finger of god and when the people saw that moses delayed to come down out of the mount the people gathered themselves together unto aaron and said unto him up make us gods which shall go before us for as for this moses the man that brought us up out of the land of egypt we wot not what is become of him and aaron said unto them break off the golden earrings which are in the ears of your wives of your sons and of your daughters and bring them unto me and all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears and brought them unto aaron and he received them at their hand and fashioned it with a graving tool after he had made it a molten calf and they said these be thy gods o israel which brought thee up out of the land of egypt and when aaron saw it he built an altar before it and aaron made proclamation and said to morrow is a feast to the lord and they rose up early on the morrow and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings and the people sat down to eat and to drink and rose up to play and the lord said unto moses go get thee down for thy people which thou broughtest out of the land of egypt have corrupted themselves they have turned aside quickly out of the way which i commanded them they have made them a molten calf and have worshipped it and have sacrificed thereunto and said these be thy gods o israel which have brought thee up out of the land of egypt and the lord said unto moses i have seen this people and behold it is a stiffnecked people now therefore let me alone that my wrath may wax hot against them and that i may consume them and i will make of thee a great nation and moses besought the lord his god and said lord why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people which thou hast brought forth out of the land of egypt with great power and with a mighty hand wherefore should the egyptians speak and say for mischief did he bring them out to slay them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth turn from thy fierce wrath and repent of this evil against thy people remember abraham isaac and israel thy servants to whom thou swarest by thine own self and saidst unto them i will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven and all this land that i have spoken of will i give unto your seed and they shall inherit it for ever and the lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people and moses turned and went down from the mount and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand the tables were written on both their sides on the one side and on the other were they written and the tables were the work of god and the writing was the writing of god graven upon the tables and when joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted he said unto moses there is a noise of war in the camp and he said it is not the voice of them that shout for mastery neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome but the noise of them that sing do i hear and it came to pass as soon as he came nigh unto the camp that he saw the calf and the dancing and moses anger waxed hot and he cast the tables out of his hands and brake them beneath the mount and he took the calf which they had made and burnt it in the fire and ground it to powder and strawed it upon the water and made the children of israel drink of it and moses said unto aaron what did this people unto thee that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them and aaron said let not the anger of my lord wax hot thou knowest the people that they are set on mischief for they said unto me make us gods which shall go before us for as for this moses the man that brought us up out of the land
