tophet which is in the valley of the son of hinnom to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire which i commanded them not neither came it into my heart therefore behold the days come saith the lord that it shall no more be called tophet nor the valley of the son of hinnom but the valley of slaughter for they shall bury in tophet till there be no place and the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven and for the beasts of the earth and none shall fray them away then will i cause to cease from the cities of judah and from the streets of jerusalem the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride for the land shall be desolate at that time saith the lord they shall bring out the bones of the kings of judah and the bones of his princes and the bones of the priests and the bones of the prophets and the bones of the inhabitants of jerusalem out of their graves and they shall spread them before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven whom they have loved and whom they have served and after whom they have walked and whom they have sought and whom they have worshipped they shall not be gathered nor be buried they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth and death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family which remain in all the places whither i have driven them saith the lord of hosts moreover thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord shall they fall and not arise shall he turn away and not return why then is this people of jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding they hold fast deceit they refuse to return i hearkened and heard but they spake not aright no man repented him of his wickedness saying what have i done every one turned to his course as the horse rusheth into the battle yea the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming but my people know not the judgment of the lord how do ye say we are wise and the law of the lord is with us lo certainly in vain made he it the pen of the scribes is in vain the wise men are ashamed they are dismayed and taken lo they have rejected the word of the lord and what wisdom is in them therefore will i give their wives unto others and their fields to them that shall inherit them for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely for they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly saying peace peace when there is no peace were they ashamed when they had committed abomination nay they were not at all ashamed neither could they blush therefore shall they fall among them that fall in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down saith the lord i will surely consume them saith the lord there shall be no grapes on the vine nor figs on the fig tree and the leaf shall fade and the things that i have given them shall pass away from them why do we sit still assemble yourselves and let us enter into the defenced cities and let us be silent there for the lord our god hath put us to silence and given us water of gall to drink because we have sinned against the lord we looked for peace but no good came and for a time of health and behold trouble the snorting of his horses was heard from dan the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones for they are come and have devoured the land and all that is in it the city and those that dwell therein for behold i will send serpents cockatrices among you which will not be charmed and they shall bite you saith the lord when i would comfort myself against sorrow my heart is faint in me behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country is not the lord in zion is not her king in her why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images and with strange vanities the harvest is past the summer is ended and we are not saved for the hurt of the daughter of my people am i hurt i am black astonishment hath taken hold on me is there no balm in gilead is there no physician there why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered oh that my head were waters and mine eyes a fountain of tears that i might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people oh that i had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men that i might leave my people and go from them for they be all adulterers an assembly of treacherous men and they bend their tongues like their bow for lies but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth for they proceed from evil to evil and they know not me saith the lord take

will not speak the truth they have taught their tongue to speak lies and weary themselves to commit iniquity thine habitation is in the midst of deceit through deceit they refuse to know me saith the lord therefore thus saith the lord of hosts behold i will melt them and try them for how shall i do for the daughter of my people their tongue is as an arrow shot out it speaketh deceit one speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth but
