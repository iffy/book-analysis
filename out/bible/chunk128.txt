two tables of stone even the tables of the covenant and the lord said unto me arise get thee down quickly from hence for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of egypt have corrupted themselves they are quickly turned aside out of the way which i commanded them they have made them a molten image furthermore the lord spake unto me saying i have seen this people and behold it is a stiffnecked people let me alone that i may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven and i will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they so i turned and came down from the mount and the mount burned with fire and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands and i looked and behold ye had sinned against the lord your god and had made you a molten calf ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the lord had commanded you and i took the two tables and cast them out of my two hands and brake them before your eyes and i fell down before the lord as at the first forty days and forty nights i did neither eat bread nor drink water because of all your sins which ye sinned in doing wickedly in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger for i was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure wherewith the lord was wroth against you to destroy you but the lord hearkened unto me at that time also and the lord was very angry with aaron to have destroyed him and i prayed for aaron also the same time and i took your sin the calf which ye had made and burnt it with fire and stamped it and ground it very small even until it was as small as dust and i cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount and at taberah and at massah and at kibrothhattaavah ye provoked the lord to wrath likewise when the lord sent you from kadeshbarnea saying go up and possess the land which i have given you then ye rebelled against the commandment of the lord your god and ye believed him not nor hearkened to his voice ye have been rebellious against the lord from the day that i knew you thus i fell down before the lord forty days and forty nights as i fell down at the first because the lord had said he would destroy you i prayed therefore unto the lord and said o lord god destroy not thy people and thine inheritance which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness which thou hast brought forth out of egypt with a mighty hand remember thy servants abraham isaac and jacob look not unto the stubbornness of this people nor to their wickedness nor to their sin lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say because the lord was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them and because he hated them he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness yet they are thy people and thine inheritance which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm at that time the lord said unto me hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first and come up unto me into the mount and make thee an ark of wood and i will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest and thou shalt put them in the ark and i made an ark of shittim wood and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first and went up into the mount having the two tables in mine hand and he wrote on the tables according to the first writing the ten commandments which the lord spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly and the lord gave them unto me and i turned myself and came down from the mount and put the tables in the ark which i had made and there they be as the lord commanded me and the children of israel took their journey from beeroth of the children of jaakan to mosera there aaron died and there he was buried and eleazar his son ministered in the priests office in his stead from thence they journeyed unto gudgodah and from gudgodah to jotbath a land of rivers of waters at that time the lord separated the tribe of levi to bear the ark of the covenant of the lord to stand before the lord to minister unto him and to bless in his name unto this day wherefore levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren the lord is his inheritance according as the lord thy god promised him and i stayed in the mount according to the first time forty days and forty nights and the lord hearkened unto me at that time also and the lord would not destroy thee and the lord said unto me arise take thy journey before the people that they may go in and possess the land which i sware unto their fathers to give unto them and now israel what doth the lord thy god require of thee but to fear the lord thy god to walk in all his ways and to love him and to serve the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul to keep the commandments of the lord and his statutes which i command thee this day for thy good behold the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the lords thy god the earth also with all that therein is only the lord had a delight in thy fathers to love them and he chose their seed after them even you above all people as it is this day circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart and be no more stiffnecked for the lord your god is god of gods and lord of lords a great god a mighty and a terrible which regardeth not persons nor taketh reward he doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow and loveth the stranger in giving him food and
