the house of simon the leper there came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment and poured it on his head as he sat at meat but when his disciples saw it they had indignation saying to what purpose is this waste for this ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor when jesus understood it he said unto them why trouble ye the woman for she hath wrought a good work upon me for ye have the poor always with you but me ye have not always for in that she hath poured this ointment on my body she did it for my burial verily i say unto you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world there shall also this that this woman hath done be told for a memorial of her then one of the twelve called judas iscariot went unto the chief priests and said unto them what will ye give me and i will deliver him unto you and they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver and from that time he sought opportunity to betray him now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to jesus saying unto him where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover and he said go into the city to such a man and say unto him the master saith my time is at hand i will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples and the disciples did as jesus had appointed them and they made ready the passover now when the even was come he sat down with the twelve and as they did eat he said verily i say unto you that one of you shall betray me and they were exceeding sorrowful and began every one of them to say unto him lord is it i and he answered and said he that dippeth his hand with me in the dish the same shall betray me the son of man goeth as it is written of him but woe unto that man by whom the son of man is betrayed it had been good for that man if he had not been born then judas which betrayed him answered and said master is it i he said unto him thou hast said and as they were eating jesus took bread and blessed it and brake it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins but i say unto you i will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new with you in my fathers kingdom and when they had sung an hymn they went out into the mount of olives then saith jesus unto them all ye shall be offended because of me this night for it is written i will smite the shepherd and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad but after i am risen again i will go before you into galilee peter answered and said unto him though all men shall be offended because of thee yet will i never be offended jesus said unto him verily i say unto thee that this night before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice peter said unto him though i should die with thee yet will i not deny thee likewise also said all the disciples then cometh jesus with them unto a place called gethsemane and saith unto the disciples sit ye here while i go and pray yonder and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee and began to be sorrowful and very heavy then saith he unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death tarry ye here and watch with me and he went a little farther and fell on his face and prayed saying o my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but as thou wilt and he cometh unto the disciples and findeth them asleep and saith unto peter what could ye not watch with me one hour watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak he went away again the second time and prayed saying o my father if this cup may not pass away from me except i drink it thy will be done and he came and found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy and he left them and went away again and prayed the third time saying the same words then cometh he to his disciples and saith unto them sleep on now and take your rest behold the hour is at hand and the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners rise let us be going behold he is at hand that doth betray me and while he yet spake lo judas one of the twelve came and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and elders of the people now he that betrayed him gave them a sign saying whomsoever i shall kiss that same is he hold him fast and forthwith he came to jesus and said hail master and kissed him and jesus said unto him friend wherefore art thou come then came they and laid hands on jesus and took him and behold one of them which were with jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck a servant of the high priests and smote off his ear then said jesus unto him put up again thy sword into his place for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword thinkest thou that i cannot now pray to my father and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels but how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be in that same hour said jesus to the multitudes are ye come out as against a thief with swords and
