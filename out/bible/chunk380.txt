repent thee concerning thy servants o satisfy us early with thy mercy that we may rejoice and be glad all our days make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us and the years wherein we have seen evil let thy work appear unto thy servants and thy glory unto their children and let the beauty of the lord our god be upon us and establish thou the work of our hands upon us yea the work of our hands establish thou it he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty i will say of the lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god in him will i trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noisome pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flieth by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday a thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou hast made the lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou dash thy foot against a stone thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet because he hath set his love upon me therefore will i deliver him i will set him on high because he hath known my name he shall call upon me and i will answer him i will be with him in trouble i will deliver him and honour him with long life will i satisfy him and shew him my salvation it is a good thing to give thanks unto the lord and to sing praises unto thy name o most high to shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning and thy faithfulness every night upon an instrument of ten strings and upon the psaltery upon the harp with a solemn sound for thou lord hast made me glad through thy work i will triumph in the works of thy hands o lord how great are thy works and thy thoughts are very deep a brutish man knoweth not neither doth a fool understand this when the wicked spring as the grass and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish it is that they shall be destroyed for ever but thou lord art most high for evermore for lo thine enemies o lord for lo thine enemies shall perish all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered but my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn i shall be anointed with fresh oil mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me the righteous shall flourish like the palm tree he shall grow like a cedar in lebanon those that be planted in the house of the lord shall flourish in the courts of our god they shall still bring forth fruit in old age they shall be fat and flourishing to shew that the lord is upright he is my rock and there is no unrighteousness in him the lord reigneth he is clothed with majesty the lord is clothed with strength wherewith he hath girded himself the world also is stablished that it cannot be moved thy throne is established of old thou art from everlasting the floods have lifted up o lord the floods have lifted up their voice the floods lift up their waves the lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters yea than the mighty waves of the sea thy testimonies are very sure holiness becometh thine house o lord for ever o lord god to whom vengeance belongeth o god to whom vengeance belongeth shew thyself lift up thyself thou judge of the earth render a reward to the proud lord how long shall the wicked how long shall the wicked triumph how long shall they utter and speak hard things and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves they break in pieces thy people o lord and afflict thine heritage they slay the widow and the stranger and murder the fatherless yet they say the lord shall not see neither shall the god of jacob regard it understand ye brutish among the people and ye fools when will ye be wise he that planted the ear shall he not hear he that formed the eye shall he not see he that chastiseth the heathen shall not he correct he that teacheth man knowledge shall not he know the lord knoweth the thoughts of man that they are vanity blessed is the man whom thou chastenest o lord and teachest him out of thy law that thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity until the pit be digged for the wicked for the lord will not cast off his people neither will he forsake his inheritance but judgment shall return unto righteousness and all the upright in heart shall follow it who will rise up for me against the evildoers or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity unless the lord had been my help my soul had almost dwelt in silence when i said my foot slippeth thy mercy o lord held me up in the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee which frameth mischief by a law they gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous and condemn the innocent blood but the lord is my defence and my god is the rock of my refuge and he shall bring upon them their own iniquity and shall cut them off in
