the lord of hosts was laid that the temple might be built for before these days there was no hire for man nor any hire for beast neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction for i set all men every one against his neighbour but now i will not be unto the residue of this people as in the former days saith the lord of hosts for the seed shall be prosperous the vine shall give her fruit and the ground shall give her increase and the heavens shall give their dew and i will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things and it shall come to pass that as ye were a curse among the heathen o house of judah and house of israel so will i save you and ye shall be a blessing fear not but let your hands be strong for thus saith the lord of hosts as i thought to punish you when your fathers provoked me to wrath saith the lord of hosts and i repented not so again have i thought in these days to do well unto jerusalem and to the house of judah fear ye not these are the things that ye shall do speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates and let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour and love no false oath for all these are things that i hate saith the lord and the word of the lord of hosts came unto me saying thus saith the lord of hosts the fast of the fourth month and the fast of the fifth and the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth shall be to the house of judah joy and gladness and cheerful feasts therefore love the truth and peace thus saith the lord of hosts it shall yet come to pass that there shall come people and the inhabitants of many cities and the inhabitants of one city shall go to another saying let us go speedily to pray before the lord and to seek the lord of hosts i will go also yea many people and strong nations shall come to seek the lord of hosts in jerusalem and to pray before the lord thus saith the lord of hosts in those days it shall come to pass that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a jew saying we will go with you for we have heard that god is with you the burden of the word of the lord in the land of hadrach and damascus shall be the rest thereof when the eyes of man as of all the tribes of israel shall be toward the lord and hamath also shall border thereby tyrus and zidon though it be very wise and tyrus did build herself a strong hold and heaped up silver as the dust and fine gold as the mire of the streets behold the lord will cast her out and he will smite her power in the sea and she shall be devoured with fire ashkelon shall see it and fear gaza also shall see it and be very sorrowful and ekron for her expectation shall be ashamed and the king shall perish from gaza and ashkelon shall not be inhabited and a bastard shall dwell in ashdod and i will cut off the pride of the philistines and i will take away his blood out of his mouth and his abominations from between his teeth but he that remaineth even he shall be for our god and he shall be as a governor in judah and ekron as a jebusite and i will encamp about mine house because of the army because of him that passeth by and because of him that returneth and no oppressor shall pass through them any more for now have i seen with mine eyes rejoice greatly o daughter of zion shout o daughter of jerusalem behold thy king cometh unto thee he is just and having salvation lowly and riding upon an ass and upon a colt the foal of an ass and i will cut off the chariot from ephraim and the horse from jerusalem and the battle bow shall be cut off and he shall speak peace unto the heathen and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea and from the river even to the ends of the earth as for thee also by the blood of thy covenant i have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water turn you to the strong hold ye prisoners of hope even to day do i declare that i will render double unto thee when i have bent judah for me filled the bow with ephraim and raised up thy sons o zion against thy sons o greece and made thee as the sword of a mighty man and the lord shall be seen over them and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning and the lord god shall blow the trumpet and shall go with whirlwinds of the south the lord of hosts shall defend them and they shall devour and subdue with sling stones and they shall drink and make a noise as through wine and they shall be filled like bowls and as the corners of the altar and the lord their god shall save them in that day as the flock of his people for they shall be as the stones of a crown lifted up as an ensign upon his land for how great is his goodness and how great is his beauty corn shall make the young men cheerful and new wine the maids ask ye of the lord rain in the time of the latter rain so the lord shall make bright clouds and give them showers of rain to every one grass in the field for the idols have spoken vanity and the diviners have seen a lie and have told false dreams they comfort in vain therefore they went their way as a flock they were troubled because there was no shepherd mine anger was
