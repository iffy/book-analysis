he went and entered into the castle and told paul then paul called one of the centurions unto him and said bring this young man unto the chief captain for he hath a certain thing to tell him so he took him and brought him to the chief captain and said paul the prisoner called me unto him and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee who hath something to say unto thee then the chief captain took him by the hand and went with him aside privately and asked him what is that thou hast to tell me and he said the jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down paul to morrow into the council as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly but do not thou yield unto them for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men which have bound themselves with an oath that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him and now are they ready looking for a promise from thee so the chief captain then let the young man depart and charged him see thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me and he called unto him two centurions saying make ready two hundred soldiers to go to caesarea and horsemen threescore and ten and spearmen two hundred at the third hour of the night and provide them beasts that they may set paul on and bring him safe unto felix the governor and he wrote a letter after this manner claudius lysias unto the most excellent governor felix sendeth greeting this man was taken of the jews and should have been killed of them then came i with an army and rescued him having understood that he was a roman and when i would have known the cause wherefore they accused him i brought him forth into their council whom i perceived to be accused of questions of their law but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds and when it was told me how that the jews laid wait for the man i sent straightway to thee and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him farewell then the soldiers as it was commanded them took paul and brought him by night to antipatris on the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him and returned to the castle who when they came to caesarea and delivered the epistle to the governor presented paul also before him and when the governor had read the letter he asked of what province he was and when he understood that he was of cilicia i will hear thee said he when thine accusers are also come and he commanded him to be kept in herods judgment hall and after five days ananias the high priest descended with the elders and with a certain orator named tertullus who informed the governor against paul and when he was called forth tertullus began to accuse him saying seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence we accept it always and in all places most noble felix with all thankfulness notwithstanding that i be not further tedious unto thee i pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words for we have found this man a pestilent fellow and a mover of sedition among all the jews throughout the world and a ringleader of the sect of the nazarenes who also hath gone about to profane the temple whom we took and would have judged according to our law but the chief captain lysias came upon us and with great violence took him away out of our hands commanding his accusers to come unto thee by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him and the jews also assented saying that these things were so then paul after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak answered forasmuch as i know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation i do the more cheerfully answer for myself because that thou mayest understand that there are yet but twelve days since i went up to jerusalem for to worship and they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man neither raising up the people neither in the synagogues nor in the city neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me but this i confess unto thee that after the way which they call heresy so worship i the god of my fathers believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets and have hope toward god which they themselves also allow that there shall be a resurrection of the dead both of the just and unjust and herein do i exercise myself to have always a conscience void to offence toward god and toward men now after many years i came to bring alms to my nation and offerings whereupon certain jews from asia found me purified in the temple neither with multitude nor with tumult who ought to have been here before thee and object if they had ought against me or else let these same here say if they have found any evil doing in me while i stood before the council except it be for this one voice that i cried standing among them touching the resurrection of the dead i am called in question by you this day and when felix heard these things having more perfect knowledge of that way he deferred them and said when lysias the chief captain shall come down i will know the uttermost of your matter and he commanded a centurion to keep paul and to let him have liberty and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him and after certain days when felix came with his wife drusilla which was a jewess he sent for paul and heard him concerning the faith in christ and as he reasoned of righteousness temperance and judgment to come felix trembled and answered go thy way for this time when i have
