the heart of the mighty men of edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs concerning damascus hamath is confounded and arpad for they have heard evil tidings they are fainthearted there is sorrow on the sea it cannot be quiet damascus is waxed feeble and turneth herself to flee and fear hath seized on her anguish and sorrows have taken her as a woman in travail how is the city of praise not left the city of my joy therefore her young men shall fall in her streets and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day saith the lord of hosts and i will kindle a fire in the wall of damascus and it shall consume the palaces of benhadad concerning kedar and concerning the kingdoms of hazor which nebuchadrezzar king of babylon shall smite thus saith the lord arise ye go up to kedar and spoil the men of the east their tents and their flocks shall they take away they shall take to themselves their curtains and all their vessels and their camels and they shall cry unto them fear is on every side flee get you far off dwell deep o ye inhabitants of hazor saith the lord for nebuchadrezzar king of babylon hath taken counsel against you and hath conceived a purpose against you arise get you up unto the wealthy nation that dwelleth without care saith the lord which have neither gates nor bars which dwell alone and their camels shall be a booty and the multitude of their cattle a spoil and i will scatter into all winds them that are in the utmost corners and i will bring their calamity from all sides thereof saith the lord and hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons and a desolation for ever there shall no man abide there nor any son of man dwell in it the word of the lord that came to jeremiah the prophet against elam in the beginning of the reign of zedekiah king of judah saying thus saith the lord of hosts behold i will break the bow of elam the chief of their might and upon elam will i bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven and will scatter them toward all those winds and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of elam shall not come for i will cause elam to be dismayed before their enemies and before them that seek their life and i will bring evil upon them even my fierce anger saith the lord and i will send the sword after them till i have consumed them and i will set my throne in elam and will destroy from thence the king and the princes saith the lord but it shall come to pass in the latter days that i will bring again the captivity of elam saith the lord the word that the lord spake against babylon and against the land of the chaldeans by jeremiah the prophet declare ye among the nations and publish and set up a standard publish and conceal not say babylon is taken bel is confounded merodach is broken in pieces her idols are confounded her images are broken in pieces for out of the north there cometh up a nation against her which shall make her land desolate and none shall dwell therein they shall remove they shall depart both man and beast in those days and in that time saith the lord the children of israel shall come they and the children of judah together going and weeping they shall go and seek the lord their god they shall ask the way to zion with their faces thitherward saying come and let us join ourselves to the lord in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten my people hath been lost sheep their shepherds have caused them to go astray they have turned them away on the mountains they have gone from mountain to hill they have forgotten their restingplace all that found them have devoured them and their adversaries said we offend not because they have sinned against the lord the habitation of justice even the lord the hope of their fathers remove out of the midst of babylon and go forth out of the land of the chaldeans and be as the he goats before the flocks for lo i will raise and cause to come up against babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country and they shall set themselves in array against her from thence she shall be taken their arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man none shall return in vain and chaldea shall be a spoil all that spoil her shall be satisfied saith the lord because ye were glad because ye rejoiced o ye destroyers of mine heritage because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass and bellow as bulls your mother shall be sore confounded she that bare you shall be ashamed behold the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness a dry land and a desert because of the wrath of the lord it shall not be inhabited but it shall be wholly desolate every one that goeth by babylon shall be astonished and hiss at all her plagues put yourselves in array against babylon round about all ye that bend the bow shoot at her spare no arrows for she hath sinned against the lord shout against her round about she hath given her hand her foundations are fallen her walls are thrown down for it is the vengeance of the lord take vengeance upon her as she hath done do unto her cut off the sower from babylon and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people and they shall flee every one to his own land israel is a scattered sheep the lions have driven him away first the king of assyria hath devoured him and last this nebuchadrezzar king of babylon hath broken his bones therefore thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will punish the king of babylon and his land as i have punished the king of assyria and i will bring israel again to his habitation
