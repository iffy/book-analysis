and he shall feed on carmel and bashan and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount ephraim and gilead in those days and in that time saith the lord the iniquity of israel shall be sought for and there shall be none and the sins of judah and they shall not be found for i will pardon them whom i reserve go up against the land of merathaim even against it and against the inhabitants of pekod waste and utterly destroy after them saith the lord and do according to all that i have commanded thee a sound of battle is in the land and of great destruction how is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken how is babylon become a desolation among the nations i have laid a snare for thee and thou art also taken o babylon and thou wast not aware thou art found and also caught because thou hast striven against the lord the lord hath opened his armoury and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation for this is the work of the lord god of hosts in the land of the chaldeans come against her from the utmost border open her storehouses cast her up as heaps and destroy her utterly let nothing of her be left slay all her bullocks let them go down to the slaughter woe unto them for their day is come the time of their visitation the voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of babylon to declare in zion the vengeance of the lord our god the vengeance of his temple call together the archers against babylon all ye that bend the bow camp against it round about let none thereof escape recompense her according to her work according to all that she hath done do unto her for she hath been proud against the lord against the holy one of israel therefore shall her young men fall in the streets and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day saith the lord behold i am against thee o thou most proud saith the lord god of hosts for thy day is come the time that i will visit thee and the most proud shall stumble and fall and none shall raise him up and i will kindle a fire in his cities and it shall devour all round about him thus saith the lord of hosts the children of israel and the children of judah were oppressed together and all that took them captives held them fast they refused to let them go their redeemer is strong the lord of hosts is his name he shall throughly plead their cause that he may give rest to the land and disquiet the inhabitants of babylon a sword is upon the chaldeans saith the lord and upon the inhabitants of babylon and upon her princes and upon her wise men a sword is upon the liars and they shall dote a sword is upon her mighty men and they shall be dismayed a sword is upon their horses and upon their chariots and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her and they shall become as women a sword is upon her treasures and they shall be robbed a drought is upon her waters and they shall be dried up for it is the land of graven images and they are mad upon their idols therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell there and the owls shall dwell therein and it shall be no more inhabited for ever neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation as god overthrew sodom and gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof saith the lord so shall no man abide there neither shall any son of man dwell therein behold a people shall come from the north and a great nation and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth they shall hold the bow and the lance they are cruel and will not shew mercy their voice shall roar like the sea and they shall ride upon horses every one put in array like a man to the battle against thee o daughter of babylon the king of babylon hath heard the report of them and his hands waxed feeble anguish took hold
