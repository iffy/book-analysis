of the north the city of the great king god is known in her palaces for a refuge for lo the kings were assembled they passed by together they saw it and so they marvelled they were troubled and hasted away fear took hold upon them there and pain as of a woman in travail thou breakest the ships of tarshish with an east wind as we have heard so have we seen in the city of the lord of hosts in the
