of jerusalem saying thus saith the lord behold i frame evil against you and devise a device against you return ye now every one from his evil way and make your ways and your doings good and they said there is no hope but we will walk after our own devices and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart therefore thus saith the lord ask ye now among the heathen who hath heard such things the virgin of israel hath done a very horrible thing will a man leave the snow of lebanon which cometh from the rock of the field or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken because my people hath forgotten me they have burned incense to vanity and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths to walk in paths in a way not cast up to make their land desolate and a perpetual hissing every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and wag his head i will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy i will shew them the back and not the face in the day of their calamity then said they come and let us devise devices against jeremiah for the law shall not perish from the priest nor counsel from the wise nor the word from the prophet come and let us smite him with the tongue and let us not give heed to any of his words give heed to me o lord and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me shall evil be recompensed for good for they have digged a pit for my soul remember that i stood before thee to speak good for them and to turn away thy wrath from them therefore deliver up their children to the famine and pour out their blood by the force of the sword and let their wives be bereaved of their children and be widows and let their men be put to death let their young men be slain by the sword in battle let a cry be heard from their houses when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them for they have digged a pit to take me and hid snares for my feet yet lord thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me forgive not their iniquity neither blot out their sin from thy sight but let them be overthrown before thee deal thus with them in the time of thine anger thus saith the lord go and get a potters earthen bottle and take of the ancients of the people and of the ancients of the priests and go forth unto the valley of the son of hinnom which is by the entry of the east gate and proclaim there the words that i shall tell thee and say hear ye the word of the lord o kings of judah and inhabitants of jerusalem thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will bring evil upon this place the which whosoever heareth his ears shall tingle because they have forsaken me and have estranged this place and have burned incense in it unto other gods whom neither they nor their fathers have known nor the kings of judah and have filled this place with the blood of innocents they have built also the high places of baal to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto baal which i commanded not nor spake it neither came it into my mind therefore behold the days come saith the lord that this place shall no more be called tophet nor the valley of the son of hinnom but the valley of slaughter and i will make void the counsel of judah and jerusalem in this place and i will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hands of them that seek their lives and their carcases will i give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven and for the beasts of the earth and i will make this city desolate and an hissing every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof and i will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and straitness wherewith their enemies and they that seek their lives shall straiten them then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee and shalt say unto them thus saith the lord of hosts even so will i break this people and this city as one breaketh a potters vessel that cannot be made whole again and they shall bury them in tophet till there be no place to bury thus will i do unto this place saith the lord and to the inhabitants thereof and even make this city as tophet and the houses of jerusalem and the houses of the kings of judah shall be defiled as the place of tophet because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven and have poured out drink offerings unto other gods then came jeremiah from tophet whither the lord had sent him to prophesy and he stood in the court of the lords house and said to all the people thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that i have pronounced against it because they have hardened their necks that they might not hear my words now pashur the son of immer the priest who was also chief governor in the house of the lord heard that jeremiah prophesied these things then pashur smote jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of benjamin which was by the house of the lord and it came to pass on the morrow that pashur brought forth jeremiah out of the stocks then said jeremiah unto him the lord hath not called thy name pashur but magormissabib for thus saith the lord behold i will make thee a terror to thyself
