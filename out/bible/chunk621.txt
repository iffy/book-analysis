discern the face of the sky and of the earth but how is it that ye do not discern this time yea and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right when thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate as thou art in the way give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him lest he hale thee to the judge and the judge deliver thee to the officer and the officer cast thee into prison i tell thee thou shalt not depart thence till thou hast paid the very last mite there were present at that season some that told him of the galilaeans whose blood pilate had mingled with their sacrifices and jesus answering said unto them suppose ye that these galilaeans were sinners above all the galilaeans because they suffered such things i tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish or those eighteen upon whom the tower in siloam fell and slew them think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in jerusalem i tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish he spake also this parable a certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came and sought fruit thereon and found none then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard behold these three years i come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none cut it down why cumbereth it the ground and he answering said unto him lord let it alone this year also till i shall dig about it and dung it and if it bear fruit well and if not then after that thou shalt cut it down and he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath and behold there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years and was bowed together and could in no wise lift up herself and when jesus saw her he called her to him and said unto her woman thou art loosed from thine infirmity and he laid his hands on her and immediately she was made straight and glorified god and the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation because that jesus had healed on the sabbath day and said unto the people there are six days in which men ought to work in them therefore come and be healed and not on the sabbath day the lord then answered him and said thou hypocrite doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall and lead him away to watering and ought not this woman being a daughter of abraham whom satan hath bound lo these eighteen years be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day and when he had said these things all his adversaries were ashamed and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him then said he unto what is the kingdom of god like and whereunto shall i resemble it it is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and cast into his garden and it grew and waxed a great tree and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it and again he said whereunto shall i liken the kingdom of god it is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened and he went through the cities and villages teaching and journeying toward jerusalem then said one unto him lord are there few that be saved and he said unto them strive to enter in at the strait gate for many i say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able when once the master of the house is risen up and hath shut to the door and ye begin to stand without and to knock at the door saying lord lord open unto us and he shall answer and say unto you i know you not whence ye are then shall ye begin to say we have eaten and drunk in thy presence and thou hast taught in our streets but he shall say i tell you i know you not whence ye are depart from me all ye workers of iniquity there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth when ye shall see abraham and isaac and jacob and all the

behold there are last which shall be first and there are first which shall be last the same day there came certain of the pharisees saying unto him get thee out and depart hence for herod will kill thee and he said unto them go ye and tell that fox behold i cast out devils and i do cures to day and to morrow and the third day i shall be perfected nevertheless i must walk to day and to morrow and the day following for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of jerusalem o jerusalem jerusalem which killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee how often would i have gathered thy children together as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings and ye would not behold your house is left unto you desolate and verily i say unto you ye shall not see me until the time come when ye shall say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord and it came to pass as he went into the house of one of the chief pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day that they watched him and behold there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy and jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and pharisees saying is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day and they held their peace and he took him and healed him and let him go and answered them saying which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day and they could not
