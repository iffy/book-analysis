came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their fathers flock and the shepherds came and drove them away but moses stood up and helped them and watered their flock and when they came to reuel their father he said how is it that ye are come so soon to day and they said an egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds and also drew water enough for us and watered the flock and he said unto his daughters and where is he why is it that ye have left the man call him that he may eat bread and moses was content to dwell with the man and he gave moses zipporah his daughter and she bare him a son and he called his name gershom for he said i have been a stranger in a strange land and it came to pass in process of time that the king of egypt died and the children of israel sighed by reason of the bondage and they cried and their cry came up unto god by reason of the bondage and god heard their groaning and god remembered his covenant with abraham with isaac and with jacob and god looked upon the children of israel and god had respect unto them now moses kept the flock of jethro his father in law the priest of midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of god even to horeb and the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed and moses said i will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt and when the lord saw that he turned aside to see god called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said moses moses and he said here am i and he said draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground moreover he said i am the god of thy father the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob and moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon god and the lord said i have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters for i know their sorrows and i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the canaanites and the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites now therefore behold the cry of the children of israel is come unto me and i have also seen the oppression wherewith the egyptians oppress them come now therefore and i will send thee unto pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of israel out of egypt and moses said unto god who am i that i should go unto pharaoh and that i should bring forth the children of israel out of egypt and he said certainly i will be with thee and this shall be a token unto thee that i have sent thee when thou hast brought forth the people out of egypt ye shall serve god upon this mountain and moses said unto god behold when i come unto the children of israel and shall say unto them the god of your fathers hath sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall i say unto them and god said unto moses i am that i am and he said thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel i am hath sent me unto you and god said moreover unto moses thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel the lord god of your fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob hath sent me unto you this is my name for ever and this is my memorial unto all generations go and gather the elders of israel together and say unto them the lord god of your fathers the god of abraham of isaac and of jacob appeared unto me saying i have surely visited you and seen that which is done to you in egypt and i have said i will bring you up out of the affliction of egypt unto the land of the canaanites and the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites unto a land flowing with milk and honey and they shall hearken to thy voice and thou shalt come thou and the elders of israel unto the king of egypt and ye shall say unto him the lord god of the hebrews hath met with us and now let us go we beseech thee three days journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the lord our god and i am sure that the king of egypt will not let you go no not by a mighty hand and i will stretch out my hand and smite egypt with all my wonders which i will do in the midst thereof and after that he will let you go and i will give this people favour in the

of gold and raiment and ye shall put them upon your sons and upon your daughters and ye shall spoil the egyptians and moses answered and said but behold they will not believe me nor hearken unto my voice for they will say the lord hath not appeared unto thee and the lord said unto him what is that in thine hand and he said a rod and he said cast it on the ground and he cast it on the ground and
