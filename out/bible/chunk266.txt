judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold and hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the lord and in the treasures of the kings house at that time did hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the lord and from the pillars which hezekiah king of judah had overlaid and gave it to the king of assyria and the king of assyria sent tartan and rabsaris and rabshakeh from lachish to king hezekiah with a great host against jerusalem and they went up and came to jerusalem and when they were come up they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool which is in the highway of the fullers field and when they had called to the king there came out to them eliakim the son of hilkiah which was over the household and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder and rabshakeh said unto them speak ye now to hezekiah thus saith the great king the king of assyria what confidence is this wherein thou trustest thou sayest but they are but vain words i have counsel and strength for the war now on whom dost thou trust that thou rebellest against me now behold thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed even upon egypt on which if a man lean it will go into his hand and pierce it so is pharaoh king of egypt unto all that trust on him but if ye say unto me we trust in the lord our god is not that he whose high places and whose altars hezekiah hath taken away and hath said to judah and jerusalem ye shall worship before this altar in jerusalem now therefore i pray thee give pledges to my lord the king of assyria and i will deliver thee two thousand horses if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my masters servants and put thy trust on egypt for chariots and for horsemen am i now come up without the lord against this place to destroy it the lord said to me go up against this land and destroy it then said eliakim the son of hilkiah and shebna and joah unto rabshakeh speak i pray thee to thy servants in the syrian language for we understand it and talk not with us in the jews language in the ears of the people that are on the wall but rabshakeh said unto them hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words hath he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall that they may eat their own dung and drink their own piss with you then rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the jews language and spake saying hear the word of the great king the king of assyria thus saith the king let not hezekiah deceive you for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand neither let hezekiah make you trust in the lord saying the lord will surely deliver us and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of assyria hearken not to hezekiah for thus saith the king of assyria make an agreement with me by a present and come out to me and then eat ye every man of his own vine and every one of his fig tree and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern until i come and take you away to a land like your own land a land of corn and wine a land of bread and vineyards a land of oil olive and of honey that ye may live and not die and hearken not unto hezekiah when he persuadeth you saying the lord will deliver us hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of assyria where are the gods of hamath and of arpad where are the gods of sepharvaim hena and ivah have they delivered samaria out of mine hand who are they among all the gods of the countries that have delivered their country out of mine hand that the lord should deliver jerusalem out of mine hand but the people held their peace and answered him not a word for the kings commandment was saying answer him not then came eliakim the son of hilkiah which was over the household and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder to hezekiah with their clothes rent and told him the words of rabshakeh and it came to pass when king hezekiah heard it that he rent his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the lord and he sent eliakim which was over the household and shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth to isaiah the prophet the son of amoz and they said unto him thus saith hezekiah this day is a day of trouble and of rebuke and blasphemy for the children are come to the birth and there is not strength to bring forth it may be the lord thy god will hear all the words of rabshakeh whom the king of assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living god and will reprove the words which the lord thy god hath heard wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left so the servants of king hezekiah came to isaiah and isaiah said unto them thus shall ye say to your master thus saith the lord be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard with which the servants of the king of assyria have blasphemed me behold i will send a blast upon him and he shall hear a rumour and shall return to his own land and i will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land so rabshakeh returned and found the king of assyria warring against libnah for he had heard that he was departed from lachish and when he heard say of tirhakah king of ethiopia behold he is
