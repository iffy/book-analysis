do no violence to the stranger the fatherless nor the widow neither shed innocent blood in this place for if ye do this thing indeed then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of david riding in chariots and on horses he and his servants and his people but if ye will not hear these words i swear by myself saith the lord that this house shall become a desolation for thus saith the lord unto the kings house of judah thou art gilead unto me and the head of lebanon yet surely i will make thee a wilderness and cities which are not inhabited and i will prepare destroyers against thee every one with his weapons and they shall cut down thy choice cedars and cast them into the fire and many nations shall pass by this city and they shall say every man to his neighbour wherefore hath the lord done thus unto this great city then they shall answer because they have forsaken the covenant of the lord their god and worshipped other gods and served them weep ye not for the dead neither bemoan him but weep sore for him that goeth away for he shall return no more nor see his native country for thus saith the lord touching shallum the son of josiah king of judah which reigned instead of josiah his father which went forth out of this place he shall not return thither any more but he shall die in the place whither they have led him captive and shall see this land no more woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness and his chambers by wrong that useth his neighbours service without wages and giveth him not for his work that saith i will build me a wide house and large chambers and cutteth him out windows and it is cieled with cedar and painted with vermilion shalt thou reign because thou closest thyself in cedar did not thy father eat and drink and do judgment and justice and then it was well with him he judged the cause of the poor and needy then it was well with him was not this to know me saith the lord but thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousness and for to shed innocent blood and for oppression and for violence to do it therefore thus saith the lord concerning jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah they shall not lament for him saying ah my brother or ah sister they shall not lament for him saying ah lord or ah his glory he shall be buried with the burial of an ass drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of jerusalem go up to lebanon and cry and lift up thy voice in bashan and cry from the passages for all thy lovers are destroyed i spake unto thee in thy prosperity but thou saidst i will not hear this hath been thy manner from thy youth that thou obeyedst not my voice the wind shall eat up all thy pastors and thy lovers shall go into captivity surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness o inhabitant of lebanon that makest thy nest in the cedars how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee the pain as of a woman in travail as i live saith the lord though coniah the son of jehoiakim king of judah were the signet upon my right hand yet would i pluck thee thence and i will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest even into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and into the hand of the chaldeans and i will cast thee out and thy mother that bare thee into another country where ye were not born and there shall ye die but to the land whereunto they desire to return thither shall they not return is this man coniah a despised broken idol is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure wherefore are they cast out he and his seed and are cast into a land which they know not o earth earth earth hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord write ye this man childless a man that shall not prosper in his days for no man of his seed shall prosper sitting upon the throne of david and ruling any more in judah woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture saith the lord therefore thus saith the lord god of israel against the pastors that feed my people ye have scattered my flock and driven them away and have not visited them behold i will visit upon you the evil of your doings saith the lord and i will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither i have driven them and will bring them again to their folds and they shall be fruitful and increase and i will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them and they shall fear no more nor be dismayed neither shall they be lacking saith the lord behold the days come saith the lord that i will raise unto david a righteous branch and a king shall reign and prosper and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth in his days judah shall be saved and israel shall dwell safely and this is his name whereby he shall be called the lord our righteousness therefore behold the days come saith the lord that they shall no more say the lord liveth which brought up the children of israel out of the land of egypt but the lord liveth which brought up and which led the seed of the house of israel out of the north country and from all countries whither i had driven them and they shall dwell in their own land mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets all my bones shake i am like a drunken man and like a man whom wine hath overcome because of the lord and because of the words of his holiness for the land is full of adulterers for because of swearing the land mourneth the pleasant places
