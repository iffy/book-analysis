that the whole land thereof is brimstone and salt and burning that it is not sown nor beareth nor any grass groweth therein like the overthrow of sodom and gomorrah admah and zeboim which the lord overthrew in his anger and in his wrath even all nations shall say wherefore hath the lord done thus unto this land what meaneth the heat of this great anger then men shall say because they have forsaken the covenant of the lord god of their fathers which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of egypt for they went and served other gods and worshipped them gods whom they knew not and whom he had not given unto them and the anger of the lord was kindled against this land to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book and the lord rooted them out of their land in anger and in wrath and in great indignation and cast them into another land as it is this day the secret things belong unto the lord our god but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever that we may do all the words of this law and it shall come to pass when all these things are come upon thee the blessing and the curse which i have set before thee and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations whither the lord thy god hath driven thee and shalt return unto the lord thy god and shalt obey his voice according to all that i command thee this day thou and thy children with all thine heart and with all thy soul that then the lord thy god will turn thy captivity and have compassion upon thee and will return and gather thee from all the nations whither the lord thy god hath scattered thee if any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven from thence will the lord thy god gather thee and from thence will he fetch thee and the lord thy god will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed and thou shalt possess it and he will do thee good and multiply thee above thy fathers and the lord thy god will circumcise thine heart and the heart of thy seed to love the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy soul that thou mayest live and the lord thy god will put all these curses upon thine enemies and on them that hate thee which persecuted thee and thou shalt return and obey the voice of the lord and do all his commandments which i command thee this day and the lord thy god will make thee plenteous in every work of thine hand in the fruit of thy body and in the fruit of thy cattle and in the fruit of thy land for good for the lord will again rejoice over thee for good as he rejoiced over thy fathers if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law and if thou turn unto the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy soul for this commandment which i command thee this day it is not hidden from thee neither is it far off it is not in heaven that thou shouldest say who shall go up for us to heaven and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it neither is it beyond the sea that thou shouldest say who shall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it but the word is very nigh unto thee in thy mouth and in thy heart that thou mayest do it see i have set before thee this day life and good and death and evil in that i command thee this day to love the lord thy god to walk in his ways and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments that thou mayest live and multiply and the lord thy god shall bless thee in the land whither thou

that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land whither thou passest over jordan to go to possess it i call heaven and earth to record this day against you that i have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that both thou and thy seed may live that thou mayest love the lord thy god and that thou mayest obey his voice and that thou mayest cleave unto him for he is thy life and the length of thy days that thou mayest dwell in the land which the lord sware unto thy fathers to abraham to isaac and to jacob to give them and moses went and spake these words unto all israel and he said unto them i am an hundred and twenty years old this day i can no more go out and come in also the lord hath said unto me thou shalt not go over this jordan the lord thy god he
