to the debtor his pledge hath spoiled none by violence hath given his bread to the hungry and hath covered the naked with a garment he that hath not given forth upon usury neither hath taken any increase that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity hath executed true judgment between man and man hath walked in my statutes and hath kept my judgments to deal truly he is just he shall surely live saith the lord god if he beget a son that is a robber a shedder of blood and that doeth the like to any one of these things and that doeth not any of those duties but even hath eaten upon the mountains and defiled his neighbours wife hath oppressed the poor and needy hath spoiled by violence hath not restored the pledge and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols hath committed abomination hath given forth upon usury and hath taken increase shall he then live he shall not live he hath done all these abominations he shall surely die his blood shall be upon him now lo if he beget a son that seeth all his fathers sins which he hath done and considereth and doeth not such like that hath not eaten upon the mountains neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of israel hath not defiled his neighbours wife neither hath oppressed any hath not withholden the pledge neither hath spoiled by violence but hath given his bread to the hungry and hath covered the naked with a garment that hath taken off his hand from the poor that hath not received usury nor increase hath executed my judgments hath walked in my statutes he shall not die for the iniquity of his father he shall surely live as for his father because he cruelly oppressed spoiled his brother by violence and did that which is not good among his people lo even he shall die in his iniquity yet say ye why doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father when the son hath done that which is lawful and right and hath kept all my statutes and hath done them he shall surely live the soul that sinneth it shall die the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him but if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed and keep all my statutes and do that which is lawful and right he shall surely live he shall not die all his transgressions that he hath committed they shall not be mentioned unto him in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live have i any pleasure at all that the wicked should die saith the lord god and not that he should return from his ways and live but when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness and committeth iniquity and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth shall he live all his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned in his trespass that he hath trespassed and in his sin that he hath sinned in them shall he die yet ye say the way of the lord is not equal hear now o house of israel is not my way equal are not your ways unequal when a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness and committeth iniquity and dieth in them for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die again when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed and doeth that which is lawful and right he shall save his soul alive because he considereth and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed he shall surely live he shall not die yet saith the house of israel the way of the lord is not equal o house of israel are not my ways equal are not your ways unequal therefore i will judge you o house of israel every one according to his ways saith the lord god repent and turn yourselves from all your transgressions so iniquity shall not be your ruin cast away from you all your transgressions whereby ye have transgressed and make you a new heart and a new spirit for why will ye die o house of israel for i have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth saith the lord god wherefore turn yourselves and live ye moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of israel and say what is thy

nations also heard of him he was taken in their pit and they brought him with chains unto the land of egypt now when she saw that she had waited and her hope was lost then she took another of her whelps and made him a young lion and he went up and down among the lions he became a young lion and learned to catch the prey and devoured men and he knew their desolate palaces and he laid waste their cities and the land was desolate and the fulness thereof by the noise of his roaring then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces and spread their net over him he was taken in their pit and they put him in ward in chains and brought him to the king of babylon they brought him into holds that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of israel thy mother is like a vine in thy blood planted by the waters she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters and she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule and her stature was exalted among the thick branches and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches but she was plucked up in fury she was cast down to the ground and the east wind dried up her
