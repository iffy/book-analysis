dwelt in their stead as israel did unto the land of his possession which the lord gave unto them now rise up said i and get you over the brook zered and we went over the brook zered and the space in which we came from kadeshbarnea until we were come over the brook zered was thirty and eight years until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host as the lord sware unto them for indeed the hand of the lord was against them to destroy them from among the host until they were consumed so it came to pass when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people that the lord spake unto me saying thou art to pass over through ar the coast of moab this day and when thou comest nigh over against the children of ammon distress them not nor meddle with them for i will not give thee of the land of the children of ammon any possession because i have given it unto the children of lot for a possession that also was accounted a land of giants giants dwelt therein in old time and the ammonites call them zamzummims a people great and many and tall as the anakims but the lord destroyed them before them and they succeeded them and dwelt in their stead as he did to the children of esau which dwelt in seir when he destroyed the horims from before them and they succeeded them and dwelt in their stead even unto this day and the avims which dwelt in hazerim even unto azzah the caphtorims which came forth out of caphtor destroyed them and dwelt in their stead rise ye up take your journey and pass over the river arnon behold i have given into thine hand sihon the amorite king of heshbon and his land begin to possess it and contend with him in battle this day will i begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven who shall hear report of thee and shall tremble and be in anguish because of thee and i sent messengers out of the wilderness of kedemoth unto sihon king of heshbon with words of peace saying let me pass through thy land i will go along by the high way i will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left thou shalt sell me meat for money that i may eat and give me water for money that i may drink only i will pass through on my feet as the children of esau which dwell in seir and the moabites which dwell in ar did unto me until i shall pass over jordan into the land which the lord our god giveth us but sihon king of heshbon would not let us pass by him for the lord thy god hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate that he might deliver him into thy hand as appeareth this day and the lord said unto me behold i have begun to give sihon and his land before thee begin to possess that thou mayest inherit his land then sihon came out against us he and all his people to fight at jahaz and the lord our god delivered him before us and we smote him and his sons and all his people and we took all his cities at that time and utterly destroyed the men and the women and the little ones of every city we left none to remain only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves and the spoil of the cities which we took from aroer which is by the brink of the river of arnon and from the city that is by the river even unto gilead there was not one city too strong for us the lord our god delivered all unto us only unto the land of the children of ammon thou camest not nor unto any place of the river jabbok nor unto the cities in the mountains nor unto whatsoever the lord our god forbad us then we turned and went up the way to bashan and og the king of bashan came out against us he and all his people to battle at edrei and the lord said unto me fear him not for i will deliver him and all his people and his land into thy hand and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto sihon king of the amorites which dwelt at heshbon so the lord our god delivered into our hands og also the king of bashan and all his people and we smote him until none was left to him remaining and we took all his cities at that time there was not a city which we took not from them threescore cities all the region of argob the kingdom of og in bashan all these cities were fenced with high walls gates and bars beside unwalled towns a great many and we utterly destroyed them as we did unto sihon king of heshbon utterly destroying the men women and children of every city but all the cattle and the spoil of the cities we took for a prey to ourselves and we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the amorites the land that was on this side jordan from the river of arnon unto mount hermon which hermon the sidonians call sirion and the amorites call it shenir all the cities of the plain and all gilead and all bashan unto salchah and edrei cities of the kingdom of og in bashan for only og king of bashan remained of the remnant of giants behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron is it not in rabbath of the children of ammon nine cubits was the length thereof and four cubits the breadth of it after the cubit of a man and this land which we possessed at that time from aroer which is by the river arnon and half mount gilead and the cities thereof gave i unto the reubenites and to the gadites and the rest of gilead and all bashan being the kingdom of og gave i unto the half
