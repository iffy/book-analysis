he was naked and did cast himself into the sea and the other disciples came in a little ship for they were not far from land but as it were two hundred cubits dragging the net with fishes as soon then as they were come to land they saw a fire of coals there and fish laid thereon and bread jesus saith unto them bring of the fish which ye have now caught simon peter went up and drew the net to land full of great fishes an hundred and fifty and three and for all there were so many yet was not the net broken jesus saith unto them come and dine and none of the disciples durst ask him who art thou knowing that it was the lord jesus then cometh and taketh bread and giveth them and fish likewise this is now the third time that jesus shewed himself to his disciples after that he was risen from the dead so when they had dined jesus saith to simon peter simon son of jonas lovest thou me more than these he saith unto him yea lord thou knowest that i love thee he saith unto him feed my lambs he saith to him again the second time simon son of jonas lovest thou me he saith unto him yea lord thou knowest that i love thee he saith unto him feed my sheep he saith unto him the third time simon son of jonas lovest thou me peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time lovest thou me and he said unto him lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that i love thee jesus saith unto him feed my sheep verily verily i say unto thee when thou wast young thou girdest thyself and walkedst whither thou wouldest but when thou shalt be old thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and another shall gird thee and carry thee whither thou wouldest not this spake he signifying by what death he should glorify god and when he had spoken this he saith unto him follow me then peter turning about seeth the disciple whom jesus loved following which also leaned on his breast at supper and said lord which is he that betrayeth thee peter seeing him saith to jesus lord and what shall this man do jesus saith unto him if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee follow thou me then went this saying abroad among the brethren that that disciple should not die yet jesus said not unto him he shall not die but if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee this is the disciple which testifieth of these things and wrote these things and we know that his testimony is true and there are also many other things which jesus did the which if they should be written every one i suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written amen the acts of the apostles the former treatise have i made o theophilus of all that jesus began both to do and teach until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the holy ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen to whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which saith he ye have heard of me for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying lord wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost is come upon

olivet which is from jerusalem a sabbath days journey and when they were come in they went up into an upper room where abode both peter and james and john and andrew philip and thomas bartholomew and

fulfilled which the holy ghost by the mouth of david spake before concerning judas which was guide to them that took jesus for he was numbered with us and had obtained part of this ministry now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity and falling headlong he burst asunder in the midst and all his bowels gushed out and it was known unto all the dwellers at jerusalem insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue aceldama that is to say the field of blood for it is written in the book of psalms let his habitation be desolate and let no man dwell therein and his bishoprick
