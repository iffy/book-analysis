so be thou mayest prevail thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels let now the astrologers the stargazers the monthly prognosticators stand up and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee behold they shall be as stubble the fire shall burn them they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame there shall not be a coal to warm at nor fire to sit before it thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured even thy merchants from thy youth they shall wander every one to his quarter none shall save thee hear ye this o house of jacob which are called by the name of israel and are come forth out of the waters of judah which swear by the name of the lord and make mention of the god of israel but not in truth nor in righteousness for they call themselves of the holy city and stay themselves upon the god of israel the lord of hosts is his name i have declared the former things from the beginning and they went forth out of my mouth and i shewed them i did them suddenly and they came to pass because i knew that thou art obstinate and thy neck is an iron sinew and thy brow brass i have even from the beginning declared it to thee before it came to pass i shewed it thee lest thou shouldest say mine idol hath done them and my graven image and my molten image hath commanded them thou hast heard see all this and will not ye declare it i have shewed thee new things from this time even hidden things and thou didst not know them they are created now and not from the beginning even before the day when thou heardest them not lest thou shouldest say behold i knew them yea thou heardest not yea thou knewest not yea from that time that thine ear was not opened for i knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously and wast called a transgressor from the womb for my names sake will i defer mine anger and for my praise will i refrain for thee that i cut thee not off behold i have refined thee but not with silver i have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction for mine own sake even for mine own sake will i do it for how should my name be polluted and i will not give my glory unto another hearken unto me o jacob and israel my called i am he i am the first i also am the last mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth and my right hand hath spanned the heavens when i call unto them they stand up together all ye assemble yourselves and hear which among them hath declared these things the lord hath loved him he will do his pleasure on babylon and his arm shall be on the chaldeans i even i have spoken yea i have called him i have brought him and he shall make his way prosperous come ye near unto me hear ye this i have not spoken in secret from the beginning from the time that it was there am i and now the lord god and his spirit hath sent me thus saith the lord thy redeemer the holy one of israel i am the lord thy god which teacheth thee to profit which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go o that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments then had thy peace been as a river and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea thy seed also had been as the sand and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me go ye forth of babylon flee ye from the chaldeans with a voice of singing declare ye tell this utter it even to the end of the earth say ye the lord hath redeemed his servant jacob and they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them he clave the rock also and the waters gushed out there is no peace saith the lord unto the wicked listen o isles unto me and hearken ye people from far the lord hath called me from the womb from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name and he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me and made me a polished shaft in his quiver hath he hid me and said unto me thou art my servant o israel in whom i will be glorified then i said i have laboured in vain i have spent my strength for nought and in vain yet surely my judgment is with the lord and my work with my god and now saith the lord that formed me from the womb to be his servant to bring jacob again to him though israel be not gathered yet shall i be glorious in the eyes of the lord and my god shall be my strength and he said it is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of jacob and to restore the preserved of israel i will also give thee for a light to the gentiles that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth thus saith the lord the redeemer of israel and his holy one to him whom man despiseth to him whom the nation abhorreth to a servant of rulers kings shall see and arise princes also shall worship because of the lord that is faithful and the holy one of israel and he shall choose thee thus saith the lord in an acceptable time have i heard thee and in a day of salvation have i helped thee and i will preserve thee and give thee for a covenant of the people to establish the earth to cause to inherit the desolate heritages that thou mayest say to the prisoners go forth to them that are in darkness shew yourselves they shall feed in the ways and their pastures shall be in
