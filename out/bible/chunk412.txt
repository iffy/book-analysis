the laughter of the fool this also is vanity surely oppression maketh a wise man mad and a gift destroyeth the heart better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry for anger resteth in the bosom of fools say not thou what is the cause that the former days were better than these for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this wisdom is good with an inheritance and by it there is profit to them that see the sun for wisdom is a defence and money is a defence but the excellency of knowledge is that wisdom giveth life to them that have it consider the work of god for who can make that straight which he hath made crooked in the day of prosperity be joyful but in the day of adversity consider god also hath set the one over against the other to the end that man should find nothing after him all things have i seen in the days of my vanity there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness be not righteous over much neither make thyself over wise why shouldest thou destroy thyself be not over much wicked neither be thou foolish why shouldest thou die before thy time it is good that thou shouldest take hold of this yea also from this withdraw not thine hand for he that feareth god shall come forth of them all wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city for there is not a just man upon earth that doeth good and sinneth not also take no heed unto all words that are spoken lest thou hear thy servant curse thee for oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others all this have i proved by wisdom i said i will be wise but it was far from me that which is far off and exceeding deep who can find it out i applied mine heart to know and to search and to seek out wisdom and the reason of things and to know the wickedness of folly even of foolishness and madness and i find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets and her hands as bands whoso pleaseth god shall escape from her but the sinner shall be taken by her behold this have i found saith the preacher counting one by one to find out the account which yet my soul seeketh but i find not one man among a thousand have i found but a woman among all those have i not found lo this only have i found that god hath made man upright but they have sought out many inventions who is as the wise man and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing a mans wisdom maketh his face to shine and the boldness of his face shall be changed i counsel thee to keep the kings commandment and that in regard of the oath of god be not hasty to go out of his sight stand not in an evil thing for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him where the word of a king is there is power and who may say unto him what doest thou whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing and a wise mans heart discerneth both time and judgment because to every purpose there is time and judgment therefore the misery of man is great upon him for he knoweth not that which shall be for who can tell him when it shall be there is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit neither hath he power in the day of death and there is no discharge in that war neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it all this have i seen and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt and so i saw the wicked buried who had come and gone from the place of the holy and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done this is also vanity because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil though a sinner do evil an hundred times and his days be prolonged yet surely i know that it shall be well with them that fear god which fear before him but it shall not be well with the wicked neither shall he prolong his days which are as a shadow because he feareth not before god there is a vanity which is done upon the earth that there be just men unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked again there be wicked men to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous i said that this also is vanity then i commended mirth because a man hath no better thing under the sun than to eat and to drink and to be merry for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life which god giveth him under the sun when i applied mine heart to know wisdom and to see the business that is done upon the earth for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes then i beheld all the work of god that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun because though a man labour to seek it out yet he shall not find it yea farther though a wise man think to know it yet shall he not be able to find it for all this i considered in my heart even to declare all this that the righteous and the wise and their works are in the hand of god no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them all things come alike to all there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked to the
