all high places they shall not hunger nor thirst neither shall the heat nor sun smite them for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them even by the springs of water shall he guide them and i will make all my mountains a way and my highways shall be exalted behold these shall come from far and lo these from the north and from the west and these from the land of sinim sing o heavens and be joyful o earth and break forth into singing o mountains for the lord hath comforted his people and will have mercy upon his afflicted but zion said the lord hath forsaken me and my lord hath forgotten me can a woman forget her sucking child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yea they may forget yet will i not forget thee behold i have graven thee upon the palms of my hands thy walls are continually before me thy children shall make haste thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee lift up thine eyes round about and behold all these gather themselves together and come to thee as i live saith the lord thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all as with an ornament and bind them on thee as a bride doeth for thy waste and thy desolate places and the land of thy destruction shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away the children which thou shalt have after thou hast lost the other shall say again in thine ears the place is too strait for me give place to me that i may dwell then shalt thou say in thine heart who hath begotten me these seeing i have lost my children and am desolate a captive and removing to and fro and who hath brought up these behold i was left alone these where had they been thus saith the lord god behold i will lift up mine hand to the gentiles and set up my standard to the people and they shall bring thy sons in their arms and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders and kings shall be thy nursing fathers and their queens thy nursing mothers they shall bow down to thee with their face toward the earth and lick up the dust of thy feet and thou shalt know that i am the lord for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me shall the prey be taken from the mighty or the lawful captive delivered but thus saith the lord even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered for i will contend with him that contendeth with thee and i will save thy children and i will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh and they shall be drunken with their own blood as with sweet wine and all flesh shall know that i the lord am thy saviour and thy redeemer the mighty one of jacob thus saith the lord where is the bill of your mothers divorcement whom i have put away or which of my creditors is it to whom i have sold you behold for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves and for your transgressions is your mother put away wherefore when i came was there no man when i called was there none to answer is my hand shortened at all that it cannot redeem or have i no power to deliver behold at my rebuke i dry up the sea i make the rivers a wilderness their fish stinketh because there is no water and dieth for thirst i clothe the heavens with blackness and i make sackcloth their covering the lord god hath given me the tongue of the learned that i should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary he wakeneth morning by morning he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned the lord god hath opened mine ear and i was not rebellious neither
