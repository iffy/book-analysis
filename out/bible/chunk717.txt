profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as ye see the day approaching for if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries he that despised moses law died without mercy under two or three witnesses of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the son of god and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace for we know him that hath said vengeance belongeth unto me i will recompense saith the lord and again the lord shall judge his people it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god but call to remembrance the former days in which after ye were illuminated ye endured a great fight of afflictions partly whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions and partly whilst ye became companions of them that were so used for ye had compassion of me in my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompence of reward for ye have need of patience that after ye have done the will of god ye might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him by faith noah being warned of god of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whither he went by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose builder and maker is god through faith also sara herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised therefore sprang there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky in multitude and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned but now they desire a better country that is an heavenly wherefore god is not ashamed to be called their god for he hath prepared for them a city by faith abraham when he was tried offered up isaac and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son of whom it was said that in isaac shall thy seed be called accounting that god was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence also he received him in a figure by faith isaac blessed jacob and esau concerning things to come by faith jacob when he was a dying blessed both the sons of joseph and worshipped leaning upon the top of his staff by faith joseph when he died made mention of the departing of the children of israel and gave commandment concerning his bones by faith moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the kings commandment by faith moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of pharaohs daughter choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures in egypt for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward by faith he forsook egypt not fearing the wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible through faith he kept the passover and the sprinkling of blood lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them by faith they passed through the red sea as by dry land which the egyptians assaying to do were drowned by faith the walls of jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days by faith the
