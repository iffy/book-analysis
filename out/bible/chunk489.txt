forth our righteousness come and let us declare in zion the work of the lord our god make bright the arrows gather the shields the lord hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the medes for his device is against babylon to destroy it because it is the vengeance of the lord the vengeance of his temple set up the standard upon the walls of babylon make the watch strong set up the watchmen prepare the ambushes for the lord hath both devised and done that which he spake against the inhabitants of babylon o thou that dwellest upon many waters abundant in treasures thine end is come and the measure of thy covetousness the lord of hosts hath sworn by himself saying surely i will fill thee with men as with caterpillers and they shall lift up a shout against thee he hath made the earth by his power he hath established the world by his wisdom and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding when he uttereth his voice there is a multitude of waters in the heavens and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth he maketh lightnings with rain and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures every man is brutish by his knowledge every founder is confounded by the graven image for his molten image is falsehood and there is no breath in them they are vanity the work of errors in the time of their visitation they shall perish the portion of jacob is not like them for he is the former of all things and israel is the rod of his inheritance the lord of hosts is his name thou art my battle axe and weapons of war for with thee will i break in pieces the nations and with thee will i destroy kingdoms and with thee will i break in pieces the horse and his rider and with thee will i break in pieces the chariot and his rider with thee also will i break in pieces man and woman and with thee will i break in pieces old and young and with thee will i break in pieces the young man and the maid i will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock and with thee will i break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen and with thee will i break in pieces captains and rulers and i will render unto babylon and to all the inhabitants of chaldea all their evil that they have done in zion in your sight saith the lord behold i am against thee o destroying mountain saith the lord which destroyest all the earth and i will stretch out mine hand upon thee and roll thee down from the rocks and will make thee a burnt mountain and they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner nor a stone for foundations but thou shalt be desolate for ever

captain against her cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers prepare against her the nations with the kings of the medes the captains thereof and all the rulers thereof and all the land of his dominion and the land shall tremble and sorrow for every purpose of the lord shall be performed against babylon to make the land of babylon a desolation without an inhabitant the mighty men of babylon have forborn to fight they have remained in their holds their might hath failed they became as women they have burned her dwellingplaces her bars are broken one post shall run to meet another and one messenger to meet another to shew the king of babylon that his city is taken at one end and that the passages are stopped and the reeds they have burned with fire and the men of war are affrighted for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel the daughter of babylon is like a threshingfloor it is time to thresh her yet a little while and the time of her harvest shall come nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon hath devoured me he hath crushed me he hath made me an empty vessel he hath swallowed me up like a dragon he hath filled his belly with my delicates he hath cast me out the violence done to me and to my flesh be upon babylon shall the inhabitant of zion say and my blood upon the inhabitants of chaldea shall jerusalem say therefore thus saith the lord behold i will plead thy cause and take vengeance for thee and i will dry up her sea and make her springs dry and babylon shall become heaps a dwellingplace for dragons an astonishment and an hissing without an inhabitant they shall roar together like lions they shall yell as lions whelps in their heat i will make their feasts and i will make them drunken that they may rejoice and sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake saith the lord i will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter like rams with he goats how is sheshach taken and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised how is babylon become an astonishment among the nations the sea is come up upon babylon she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof her cities are a desolation a dry land and a wilderness a land wherein no man dwelleth neither doth any son of man pass thereby and i will punish bel in babylon and i will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him
