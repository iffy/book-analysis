house of the lord into the chamber of the sons of hanan the son of igdaliah a man of god which was by the chamber of the princes which was above the chamber of maaseiah the son of shallum the keeper of the door and i set before the sons of the house of the rechabites pots full of wine and cups and i said unto them drink ye wine but they said we will drink no wine for jonadab the son of rechab our father commanded us saying ye shall drink no wine neither ye nor your sons for ever neither shall ye build house nor sow seed nor plant vineyard nor have any but all your days ye shall dwell in tents that ye may live many days in the land where ye be strangers thus have we obeyed the voice of jonadab the son of rechab our father in all that he hath charged us to drink no wine all our days we our wives our sons nor our daughters nor to build houses for us to dwell in neither have we vineyard nor field nor seed but we have dwelt in tents and have obeyed and done according to all that jonadab our father commanded us but it came to pass when nebuchadrezzar king of babylon came up into the land that we said come and let us go to jerusalem for fear of the army of the chaldeans and for fear of the army of the syrians so we dwell at jerusalem then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah saying thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel go and tell the men of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words saith the lord the words of jonadab the son of rechab that he commanded his sons not to drink wine are performed for unto this day they drink none but obey their fathers commandment notwithstanding i have spoken unto you rising early and speaking but ye hearkened not unto me i have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets rising up early and sending them saying return ye now every man from his evil way and amend your doings and go not after other gods to serve them and ye shall dwell in the land which i have given to you and to your fathers but ye have not inclined your ear nor hearkened unto me because the sons of jonadab the son of rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them but this people hath not hearkened unto me therefore thus saith the lord god of hosts the god of israel behold i will bring upon judah and upon all the inhabitants of jerusalem all the evil that i have pronounced against them because i have spoken unto them but they have not heard and i have called unto them but they have not answered and jeremiah said unto the house of the rechabites thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel because ye have obeyed the commandment of jonadab your father and kept all his precepts and done according unto all that he hath commanded you therefore thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel jonadab the son of rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever and it came to pass in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah that this word came unto jeremiah from the lord saying take thee a roll of a book and write therein all the words that i have spoken unto thee against israel and against judah and against all the nations from the day i spake unto thee from the days of josiah even unto this day it may be that the house of judah will hear all the evil which i purpose to do unto them that they may return every man from his evil way that i may forgive their iniquity and their sin then jeremiah called baruch the son of neriah and baruch wrote from the mouth of jeremiah all the words of the lord which he had spoken unto him upon a roll of a book and jeremiah commanded baruch saying i am shut up i cannot go into the house of the lord therefore go thou and read in the roll which thou hast written from my mouth the words of the lord in the ears of the people in the lords house upon the fasting day and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all judah that come out of their cities it may be they will present their supplication before the lord and will return every one from his evil way for great is the anger and the fury that the lord hath pronounced against this people and baruch the son of neriah did according to all that jeremiah the prophet commanded him reading in the book the words of the lord in the lords house and it came to pass in the fifth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah in the ninth month that they proclaimed a fast before the lord to all the people in jerusalem and to all the people that came from the cities of judah unto jerusalem then read baruch in the book the words of jeremiah in the house of the lord in the chamber of gemariah the son of shaphan the scribe in the higher court at the entry of the new gate of the lords house in the ears of all the people when michaiah the son of gemariah the son of shaphan had heard out of the book all the words of the lord then he went down into the kings house into the scribes chamber and lo all the princes sat there even elishama the scribe and delaiah the son of shemaiah and elnathan the son of achbor and gemariah the son of shaphan and zedekiah the son of hananiah and all the princes then michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard when baruch read the book in the ears of the people therefore all the princes sent jehudi the son of nethaniah the son of shelemiah the son of cushi unto baruch
