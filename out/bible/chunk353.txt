it and brake up for it my decreed place and set bars and doors and said hitherto shalt thou come but no further and here shall thy proud waves be stayed hast thou commanded the morning since thy days and caused the dayspring to know his place that it might take hold of the ends of the earth that the wicked might be shaken out of it it is turned as clay to the seal and they stand as a garment and from the wicked their light is withholden and the high arm shall be broken hast thou entered into the springs of the sea or hast thou walked in the search of the depth have the gates of death been opened unto thee or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth declare if thou knowest it all where is the way where light dwelleth and as for darkness where is the place thereof that thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof knowest thou it because thou wast then born or because the number of thy days is great hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail which i have reserved against the time of trouble against the day of battle and war by what way is the light parted which scattereth the east wind upon the earth who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters or a way for the lightning of thunder to cause it to rain on the earth where no man is on the wilderness wherein there is no man to satisfy the desolate and waste ground and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth hath the rain a father or who hath begotten the drops of dew out of whose womb came the ice and the hoary frost of heaven who hath gendered it the waters are hid as with a stone and the face of the deep is frozen canst thou bind the sweet influences of pleiades or loose the bands of orion canst thou bring forth mazzaroth in his season or canst thou guide arcturus with his sons knowest thou the ordinances of heaven canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds that abundance of waters may cover thee canst thou send lightnings that they may go and say unto thee here we are who hath put wisdom in the inward parts or who hath given understanding to the heart who can number the clouds in wisdom or who can stay the bottles of heaven when the dust groweth into hardness and the clods cleave fast together wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion or fill the appetite of the young lions when they couch in their dens and abide in the covert to lie in wait who provideth for the raven his food when his young ones cry unto god they wander for lack of meat knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve canst thou number the months that they fulfil or knowest thou the time when they bring forth they bow themselves they bring forth their young ones they cast out their sorrows their young ones are in good liking they grow up with corn they go forth and return not unto them who hath sent out the wild ass free or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass whose house i have made the wilderness and the barren land his dwellings he scorneth the multitude of the city neither regardeth he the crying of the driver the range of the mountains is his pasture and he searcheth after every green thing will the unicorn be willing to serve thee or abide by thy crib canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow or will he harrow the valleys after thee wilt thou trust him because his strength is great or wilt thou leave thy labour to him wilt thou believe him that he will bring home thy seed and gather it into thy barn gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks or wings and feathers unto the ostrich which leaveth her eggs in the earth and warmeth them in dust and forgetteth that the foot may crush them or that the wild beast may break them she is hardened against her young ones as though they were not hers her labour is in vain without fear because god hath deprived her of wisdom neither hath he imparted to her understanding what time she lifteth up herself on high she scorneth the horse and his rider hast thou given the horse strength hast thou clothed his neck with thunder canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper the glory of his nostrils is terrible he paweth in the valley and rejoiceth in his strength he goeth on to meet the armed men he mocketh at fear and is not affrighted neither turneth he back from the sword the quiver rattleth against him the glittering spear and the shield he swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet he saith among the trumpets ha ha and he smelleth the battle afar off the thunder of the captains and the shouting doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom and stretch her wings toward the south doth the eagle mount up at thy command and make her nest on high she dwelleth and abideth on the rock upon the crag of the rock and the strong place from thence she seeketh the prey and her eyes behold afar off her young ones also suck up blood and where the slain are there is she moreover the lord answered job and said shall he that contendeth with the almighty instruct him he that reproveth god let him answer it then job answered the lord and said behold i am vile what shall i answer thee
