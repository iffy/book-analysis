with dreams and terrifiest me through visions so that my soul chooseth strangling and death rather than my life i loathe it i would not live alway let me alone for my days are vanity what is man that thou shouldest magnify him and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him and that thou shouldest visit him every morning and try him every moment how long wilt thou not depart from me nor let me alone till i swallow down my spittle i have sinned what shall i do unto thee o thou preserver of men why hast thou set me as a mark against thee so that i am a burden to myself and why dost thou not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity for now shall i sleep in the dust and thou shalt seek me in the morning but i shall not be then answered bildad the shuhite and said how long wilt thou speak these things and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind doth god pervert judgment or doth the almighty pervert justice if thy children have sinned against him and he have cast them away for their transgression if thou wouldest seek unto god betimes and make thy supplication to the almighty if thou wert pure and upright surely now he would awake for thee and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous though thy beginning was small yet thy latter end should greatly increase for enquire i pray thee of the former age and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers for we are but of yesterday and know nothing because our days upon earth are a shadow shall not they teach thee and tell thee and utter words out of their heart can the rush grow up without mire can the flag grow without water whilst it is yet in his greenness and not cut down it withereth before any other herb so are the paths of all that forget god and the hypocrites hope shall perish whose hope shall be cut off and whose trust shall be a spiders web he shall lean upon his house but it shall not stand he shall hold it fast but it shall not endure he is green before the sun and his branch shooteth forth in his garden his roots are wrapped about the heap and seeth the place of stones if he destroy him from his place then it shall deny him saying i have not seen thee behold this is the joy of his way and out of the earth shall others grow behold god will not cast away a perfect man neither will he help the evil doers till he fill thy mouth with laughing and thy lips with rejoicing they that hate thee shall be clothed with shame and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought then job answered and said i know it is so of a truth but how should man be just with god if he will contend with him he cannot answer him one of a thousand he is wise in heart and mighty in strength who hath hardened himself against him and hath prospered which removeth the mountains and they know not which overturneth them in his anger which shaketh the earth out of her place and the pillars thereof tremble which commandeth the sun and it riseth not and sealeth up the stars which alone spreadeth out the heavens and treadeth upon the waves of the sea which maketh arcturus orion and pleiades and the chambers of the south which doeth great things past finding out yea and wonders without number lo he goeth by me and i see him not he passeth on also but i perceive him not behold he taketh away who can hinder him who will say unto him what doest thou if god will not withdraw his anger the proud helpers do stoop under him how much less shall i answer him and choose out my words to reason with him whom though i were righteous yet would i not answer but i would make supplication to my judge if i had called and he had answered me yet would i not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice for he breaketh me with a tempest and multiplieth my wounds without cause he will not suffer me to take my breath but filleth me with bitterness if i speak of strength lo he is strong and if of judgment who shall set me a time to plead if i justify myself mine own mouth shall condemn me if i say i am perfect it shall also prove me perverse though i were perfect yet would i not know my soul i would despise my life this is one thing therefore i said it he destroyeth the perfect and the wicked if the scourge slay suddenly he will laugh at the trial of the innocent the earth is given into the hand of the wicked he covereth the faces of the judges thereof if not where and who is he now my days are swifter than a post they flee away they see no good they are passed away as the swift ships as the eagle that hasteth to the prey if i say i will forget my complaint i will leave off my heaviness and comfort myself i am afraid of all my sorrows i know that thou wilt not hold me innocent if i be wicked why then labour i in vain if i wash myself with snow water and make my hands never so clean yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch and mine own clothes shall abhor me for he is not a man as i am that i should answer him and we should come together in judgment neither is there any daysman betwixt us that might lay his hand upon us both let him take his rod away from me and let not his fear terrify me then would i speak and not fear him but it is not so with me my soul is weary of my life i will leave my complaint upon myself i will speak in the bitterness of my soul i will say unto god do not condemn me shew me wherefore
