miss anne because you may be able to set things to rights that i have no very good opinion of mrs charles's nursery-maid i hear strange stories of her she is always upon the gad and from my own knowledge i can declare she is such a fine-dressing lady that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near mrs charles quite swears by her i know but i just give you this hint that you may be upon the watch because if you see anything amiss you need not be afraid of mentioning it again it was mary's complaint that mrs musgrove was very apt not to give her the precedence
