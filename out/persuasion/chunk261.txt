of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our lodgings at north yarmouth we had better not talk about it my dear replied mrs croft pleasantly for if miss elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together i had known you by character however long before well and i had heard of you as a very pretty girl and what were we to wait for besides i do not like having such things so long in hand i wish frederick would spread a little more canvass and bring us home one of these young ladies to kellynch
