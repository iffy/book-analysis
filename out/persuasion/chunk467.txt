hayter who had been calling much oftener than was welcome between ourselves i think it a great pity henrietta did not remain at lyme as long as louisa it would have kept her a little out of his way the carriage is gone to-day to bring louisa and the harvilles to-morrow we are not asked to dine with them however till the day after mrs musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey which is not very likely considering the care that will be taken of her and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to-morrow i am glad you find mr elliot so agreeable
