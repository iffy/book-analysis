to think i should never see you i am so ill i can hardly speak i have not seen a creature the whole morning i am sorry to find you unwell replied anne you sent me such a good account of yourself on thursday yes i made the best of it i always do but i was very far from well at the time and i do not think i ever was so ill in my life as i have been all this morning very unfit to be left alone i am sure suppose i were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way and not able to ring the bell
