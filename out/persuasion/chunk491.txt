first of all you must tell me the name of the young lady i am going to talk about that young lady you know that we have all been so concerned for the miss musgrove that all this has been happening to her christian name i always forget her christian name anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really did but now she could safely suggest the name of louisa ay ay miss louisa musgrove that is the name i wish young ladies had not such a number of fine christian names i should never be out if they were all sophys or something of that sort
