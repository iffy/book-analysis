and mr elliot marry that your father is not to marry mrs clay a scheme worthy of mrs walliss understanding by all accounts but my sensible nurse rooke sees the absurdity of it why to be sure maam said she it would not prevent his marrying anybody else and indeed to own the truth i do not think nurse in her heart is a very strenuous opposer of sir walters making a second match she must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony you know and since self will intrude who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next lady elliot through mrs walliss recommendation
