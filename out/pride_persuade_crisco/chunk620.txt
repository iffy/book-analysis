pray put no construction on my words i do not mean they should convey and give them no undue weight no said albert the engagement is broken off well said beauchamp then seeing the young man was about to relapse into melancholy let us go out albert said he a ride in the wood in the phaeton or on horseback will refresh you we will then return to breakfast and you shall attend to your affairs and i to mine willingly said albert but let us walk i think a little exertion would do me good the two friends walked out on the fortress when they arrived at the madeleine since we are out said beauchamp let us call on m de monte cristo he is admirably adapted to revive ones spirits because he never interrogates and in my opinion those who ask no questions are the best comforters gladly said albert let us call i love him chapter the journey monte cristo uttered a joyful exclamation on seeing the young men together ah ha said he i hope all is over explained and settled yes said beauchamp the absurd reports have died away and should they be renewed i would be the first to oppose them so let us speak no more of it albert will tell you replied the count that i gave him the same advice look added he i am finishing the most execrable mornings work what is it said albert arranging your papers apparently my papers thank god no my papers are all in capital order because i have none but m cavalcantis m cavalcantis asked beauchamp yes do you not know that this is a young man whom the count is introducing said morcerf let us not misunderstand each other replied monte cristo i introduce no one and certainly not m cavalcanti and who said albert with a forced smile is to marry mademoiselle danglars instead of me which grieves me cruelly what cavalcanti is going to marry mademoiselle danglars asked beauchamp certainly do you come from the end of the world said monte cristo you a journalist the husband of renown it is the talk of all paris and you count have made this match asked beauchamp i silence purveyor of gossip do not spread that report i make a match no you do not know me i have done all in my power to oppose it ah i understand said beauchamp on our friend alberts account on my account said the young man oh no indeed the count will do me the justice to assert that i have on the contrary always entreated him to break off my engagement and happily it is ended the count pretends i have not him to thank so be it i will erect an altar deo ignoto listen said monte cristo i have had little to do with it for i am at variance both with the father-in-law and the young man there is only mademoiselle eugnie who appears but little charmed with the thoughts of matrimony and who seeing how little i was disposed to persuade her to renounce her dear liberty retains any affection for me and do you say this wedding is at hand oh yes in spite of all i could say i do not know the young man he is said to be of good family and rich but i never trust to vague assertions i have warned m danglars of it till i am tired but he is fascinated with his luccanese i have even informed him of a circumstance i consider very serious the young man was either charmed by his nurse stolen by gypsies or lost by his tutor i scarcely know which but i do know his father lost sight of him for more than ten years what he did during these ten years god only knows well all that was useless they have commissioned me to write to the major to demand papers and here they are i send them but like pilate washing my hands and what does mademoiselle darmilly say to you for robbing her of her pupil oh well i dont know but i understand that she is going to italy madame danglars asked me for letters of recommendation for the impresari i gave her a few lines for the director of the valle theatre who is under some obligation to me but what is the matter albert you look dull are you after all unconsciously in love with mademoiselle eugnie i am not aware of it said albert smiling sorrowfully beauchamp turned to look at some paintings but continued monte cristo you are not in your usual spirits i have a dreadful headache said albert well my dear viscount said monte cristo i have an infallible remedy to propose to you what is that asked the young man a change indeed said albert yes and as i am just now excessively annoyed i shall go from home shall we go together you annoyed count said beauchamp and by what ah you think very lightly of it i should like to see you with a brief preparing in your house what brief the one m de villefort is preparing against my amiable assassin some brigand escaped from the gallows apparently true said beauchamp i saw it in the paper who is this caderousse some provenal
