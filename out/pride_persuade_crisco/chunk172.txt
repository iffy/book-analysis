her as able to persuade a person to anything i am afraid of her as i have told you before quite afraid of her because she is so very clever but i respect her amazingly and wish we had such a neighbour at uppercross anne was amused by henriettas manner of being grateful and amused also that the course of events and the new interests of henriettas views should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the musgrove family she had only time however for a general answer and a wish that such another woman were at uppercross before all subjects suddenly ceased on seeing louisa and captain wentworth coming towards them they came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready but louisa recollecting immediately afterwards that she had something to procure at a shop invited them all to go back with her into the town they were all at her disposal when they came to the steps leading upwards from the beach a gentleman at the same moment preparing to come down politely drew back and stopped to give them way they ascended and passed him and as they passed annes face caught his eye and he looked at her with a degree of earnest admiration which she could not be insensible of she was looking remarkably well her very regular very pretty features having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind which had been blowing on her complexion and by the animation of eye which it had also produced it was evident that the gentleman completely a gentleman in manner admired her exceedingly captain wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which shewed his noticing of it he gave her a momentary glance a glance of brightness which seemed to say that man is struck with you and even i at this moment see something like anne elliot again after attending louisa through her business and loitering about a little longer they returned to the inn and anne in passing afterwards quickly from her own chamber to their dining-room had nearly run against the very same gentleman as he came out of an adjoining apartment she had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves and determined that a well-looking groom who was strolling about near the two inns as they came back should be his servant both master and man being in mourning assisted the idea it was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves and this second meeting short as it was also proved again by the gentlemans looks that he thought hers very lovely and by the readiness and propriety of his apologies that he was a man of exceedingly good manners he seemed about thirty and though not handsome had an agreeable person anne felt that she should like to know who he was they had nearly done breakfast when the sound of a carriage almost the first they had heard since entering lyme drew half the party to the window it was a gentlemans carriage a curricle but only coming round from the stable-yard to the front door somebody must be going away it was driven by a servant in mourning the word curricle made charles musgrove jump up that he might compare it with his own the servant in mourning roused annes curiosity and the whole six were collected to look by the time the owner of the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows and civilities of the household and taking his seat to drive off ah cried captain wentworth instantly and with half a glance at anne it is the very man we passed the miss musgroves agreed to it and having all kindly watched him as far up the hill as they could they returned to the breakfast table the waiter came into the room soon afterwards pray said captain wentworth immediately can you tell us the name of the gentleman who is just gone away yes sir a mr elliot a gentleman of large fortune came in last night from sidmouth dare say you heard the carriage sir while you were at dinner and going on now for crewkherne in his way to bath and london elliot many had looked on each other and many had repeated the name before all this had been got through even by the smart rapidity of a waiter bless me cried mary it must be our cousin it must be our mr elliot it must indeed charles anne must not it in mourning you see just as our mr elliot must be how very extraordinary in the very same inn with us anne must not it be our mr elliot my fathers next heir pray sir turning to the waiter did not you hear did not his servant say whether he belonged to the kellynch family no maam he did not mention no particular family but he said his master was a very rich gentleman and would be a baronight some day there you see cried mary in an ecstasy just as i said heir to sir walter elliot i was sure that would come out if it was so depend upon it that is a circumstance which his servants take care to publish wherever he goes but anne only
