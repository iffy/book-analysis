and peasants screaming fighting gesticulating throwing eggs filled with flour confetti nosegays attacking with their sarcasms and their missiles friends and foes companions and strangers indiscriminately and no one took offence or did anything but laugh franz and albert were like men who to drive away a violent sorrow have recourse to wine and who as they drink and become intoxicated feel a thick veil drawn between the past and the present they saw or rather continued to see the image of what they had witnessed but little by little the general vertigo seized them and they felt themselves obliged to take part in the noise and confusion a handful of confetti that came from a neighboring carriage and which while it covered morcerf and his two companions with dust pricked his neck and that portion of his face uncovered by his mask like a hundred pins incited him to join in the general combat in which all the masks around him were engaged he rose in his turn and seizing handfuls of confetti and sweetmeats with which the carriage was filled cast them with all the force and skill he was master of m the strife had fairly begun and the recollection of what they had seen half an hour before was gradually effaced from the young mens minds so much were they occupied by the gay and glittering procession they now beheld as for the count of monte cristo he had never for an instant shown any appearance of having been moved imagine the large and splendid corso bordered from one end to the other with lofty palaces with their balconies hung with carpets and their windows with flags at these balconies are three hundred thousand spectators romans italians strangers from all parts of the world the united aristocracy of birth wealth and genius lovely women yielding to the influence of the scene bend over their balconies or lean from their windows and shower down confetti which are returned by bouquets the air seems darkened with the falling confetti and flying flowers in the streets the lively crowd is dressed in the most fantastic costumes gigantic cabbages walk gravely about buffaloes heads bellow from mens shoulders dogs walk on their hind legs in the midst of all this a mask is lifted and as in callots temptation of st anthony a lovely face is exhibited which we would fain follow but from which we are separated by troops of fiends this will give a faint idea of the carnival at rome at the second turn the count stopped the carriage and requested permission to withdraw leaving the vehicle at their disposal franz looked up they were opposite the rospoli palace at the centre window the one hung with white damask with a red cross was a blue domino beneath which franzs imagination easily pictured the beautiful greek of the argentina gentlemen said the count springing out when you are tired of being actors and wish to become spectators of this scene you know you have places at my windows in the meantime dispose of my coachman my carriage and my servants we have forgotten to mention that the counts coachman was attired in a bear-skin exactly resembling odrys in the bear and the pasha and the two footmen behind were dressed up as green monkeys with spring masks with which they made grimaces at everyone who passed franz thanked the count for his attention as for albert he was busily occupied throwing bouquets at a carriage full of roman peasants that was passing near him unfortunately for him the line of carriages moved on again and while he descended the piazza del popolo the other ascended towards the palazzo di venezia ah my dear fellow said he to franz you did not see what there that calash filled with roman peasants no well i am convinced they are all charming women how unfortunate that you were masked albert said franz here was an opportunity of making up for past disappointments oh replied he half laughing half serious i hope the carnival will not pass without some amends in one shape or the other but in spite of alberts hope the day passed unmarked by any incident excepting two or three encounters with the carriage full of roman peasants at one of these encounters accidentally or purposely alberts mask fell off he instantly rose and cast the remainder of the bouquets into the carriage doubtless one of the charming females albert had detected beneath their coquettish disguise was touched by his gallantry for as the carriage of the two friends passed her she threw a bunch of violets albert seized it and as franz had no reason to suppose it was meant for him he suffered albert to retain it albert placed it in his button-hole and the carriage went triumphantly on well said franz to him there is the beginning of an adventure laugh if you please i really think so so i will not abandon this bouquet pardieu returned franz laughing in token of your ingratitude the jest however soon appeared to become earnest for when albert and franz again encountered the carriage with the contadini the one who had thrown the violets to albert clapped her hands when she beheld them in his button-hole bravo bravo said franz things go wonderfully shall i leave you perhaps you would
