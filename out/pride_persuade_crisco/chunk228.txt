and approached the harbor under topsails jib and spanker but so slowly and sedately that the idlers with that instinct which is the forerunner of evil asked one another what misfortune could have happened on board however those experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any accident had occurred it was not to the vessel herself for she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled the anchor a-cockbill the jib-boom guys already eased off and standing by the side of the pilot who was steering the pharaon towards the narrow entrance of the inner port was a young man who with activity and vigilant eye watched every motion of the ship and repeated each direction of the pilot the vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much affected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the vessel in harbor but jumping into a small skiff desired to be pulled alongside the pharaon which he reached as she rounded into la rserve basin when the young man on board saw this person approach he left his station by the pilot and hat in hand leaned over the ships bulwarks he was a fine tall slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty with black eyes and hair as dark as a ravens wing and his whole appearance bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from their cradle to contend with danger ah is it you dants cried the man in the skiff whats the matter and why have you such an air of sadness aboard a great misfortune m morrel replied the young man a great misfortune for me especially off civita vecchia we lost our brave captain leclere and the cargo inquired the owner eagerly is all safe m morrel and i think you will be satisfied on that head but poor captain leclere what happened to him asked the owner with an air of considerable resignation what happened to the worthy captain he died fell into the sea no sir he died of brain-fever in dreadful agony then turning to the crew he said bear a hand there to take in sail all hands obeyed and at once the eight or ten seamen who composed the crew sprang to their respective stations at the spanker brails and outhaul topsail sheets and halyards the jib downhaul and the topsail clewlines and buntlines the young sailor gave a look to see that his orders were promptly and accurately obeyed and then turned again to the owner and how did this misfortune occur inquired the latter resuming the interrupted conversation m alas sir in the most unexpected manner after a long talk with the harbor-master captain leclere left naples greatly disturbed in mind in twenty-four hours he was attacked by a fever and died three days afterwards we performed the usual burial service and he is at his rest sewn up in his hammock with a thirty-six-pound shot at his head and his heels off el giglio island we bring to his widow his sword and cross of honor it was worth while truly added the young man with a melancholy smile to make war against the english for ten years and to die in his bed at last like everybody else why you see edmond replied the owner who appeared more comforted at every moment we are all mortal and the old must make way for the young if not why there would be no promotion and since you assure me that the cargo is all safe and sound m morrel take my word for it and i advise you not to take francs for the profits of the voyage then as they were just passing the round tower the young man shouted stand by there to lower the topsails and jib brail up the spanker the order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a man-of-war let go and clue up at this last command all the sails were lowered and the vessel moved almost imperceptibly onwards now if you will come on board m morrel said dants observing the owners impatience here is your supercargo m danglars coming out of his cabin who will furnish you with every particular as for me i must look after the anchoring and dress the ship in mourning the owner did not wait for a second invitation he seized a rope which dants flung to him and with an activity that would have done credit to a sailor climbed up the side of the ship while the young man going to his task left the conversation to danglars who now came towards the owner he was a man of twenty-five or twenty-six years of age of unprepossessing countenance obsequious to his superiors insolent to his subordinates and this in addition to his position as responsible agent on board which is always obnoxious to the sailors made him as much disliked by the crew as edmond dants was beloved by them well m morrel said danglars you have heard of the misfortune that has befallen us yes yes poor captain leclere he was a brave and an honest man and a first-rate seaman one who had seen long and honorable service as became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as that of morrel son replied danglars
