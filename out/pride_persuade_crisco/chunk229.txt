but replied the owner glancing after dants who was watching the anchoring of his vessel it seems to me that a sailor needs not be so old as you say danglars to understand his business for our friend edmond seems to understand it thoroughly and not to require instruction from anyone yes said danglars darting at edmond a look gleaming with hate yes he is young and youth is invariably self-confident scarcely was the captains breath out of his body when he assumed the command without consulting anyone and he caused us to lose a day and a half at the island of elba instead of making for marseilles direct m as to taking command of the vessel replied morrel that was his duty as captains mate as to losing a day and a half off the island of elba he was wrong unless the vessel needed repairs the vessel was in as good condition as i am and as i hope you are m morrel and this day and a half was lost from pure whim for the pleasure of going ashore and nothing else dants said the shipowner turning towards the young man come this way in a moment sir answered dants and im with you then calling to the crew he said let go the anchor was instantly dropped and the chain ran rattling through the port-hole dants continued at his post in spite of the presence of the pilot until this manuvre was completed and then he added half-mast the colors and square the yards you see said danglars he fancies himself captain already upon my word and so in fact he is said the owner except your signature and your partners m morrel and why should he not have this asked the owner he is young it is true but he seems to me a thorough seaman and of full experience a cloud passed over danglars brow your pardon m morrel said dants approaching the vessel now rides at anchor and i am at your service you hailed me i think danglars retreated a step or two i wished to inquire why you stopped at the island of elba i do not know sir it was to fulfil the last instructions of captain leclere who when dying gave me a packet for marshal bertrand then did you see him edmond who the marshal yes morrel looked around him and then drawing dants on one side he said suddenly and how is the emperor very well as far as i could judge from the sight of him you saw the emperor then he entered the marshals apartment while i was there and you spoke to him why it was he who spoke to me sir said dants with a smile and what did he say to you asked me questions about the vessel the time she left marseilles the course she had taken and what was her cargo i believe if she had not been laden and i had been her master he would have bought her but i told him i was only mate and that she belonged to the firm of morrel son ah yes he said i know them the morrels have been shipowners from father to son and there was a morrel who served in the same regiment with me when i was in garrison at valence pardieu and that is true cried the owner greatly delighted and that was policar morrel my uncle who was afterwards a captain dants you must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him and you will see it will bring tears into the old soldiers eyes come come continued he patting edmonds shoulder kindly you did very right dants to follow captain lecleres instructions and touch at elba although if it were known that you had conveyed a packet to the marshal and had conversed with the emperor it might bring you into trouble m how could that bring me into trouble sir asked dants for i did not even know of what i was the bearer and the emperor merely made such inquiries as he would of the first comer but pardon me here are the health officers and the customs inspectors coming alongside and the young man went to the gangway as he departed danglars approached and said well it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his landing at porto-ferrajo yes most satisfactory my dear danglars well so much the better said the supercargo for it is not pleasant to think that a comrade has not done his duty dants has done his replied the owner and that is not saying much it was captain leclere who gave orders for this delay talking of captain leclere has not dants given you a letter from him to me no was there one i believe that besides the packet captain leclere confided a letter to his care of what packet are you speaking danglars why that which dants left at porto-ferrajo how do you know he had a packet to leave at porto-ferrajo danglars turned very red i was passing close to the door of the captains cabin which was half open and i saw him give the packet and letter to dants he did not speak to me of it replied the shipowner but if there be any letter he will give it
