look into my conduct during the last four years that we have ceased to be husband and wife and see whether it has not always been consistent some time after our rupture you wished to study music under the celebrated baritone who made such a successful appearance at the thtre italien at the same time i felt inclined to learn dancing of the danseuse who acquired such a reputation in london this cost me on your account and mine francs i said nothing for we must have peace in the house and francs for a lady and gentleman to be properly instructed in music and dancing are not too much well you soon become tired of singing and you take a fancy to study diplomacy with the ministers secretary you understand it signifies nothing to me so long as you pay for your lessons out of your own cash box but today i find you are drawing on mine and that your apprenticeship may cost me francs per month stop there madame for this cannot last either the diplomatist must give his lessons gratis and i will tolerate him or he must never set his foot again in my house do you understand madame oh this is too much cried hermine choking you are worse than despicable but continued danglars i find you did not even pause there insults you are right let us leave these facts alone and reason coolly i have never interfered in your affairs excepting for your good treat me in the same way you say you have nothing to do with my cash box be it so do as you like with your own but do not fill or empty mine besides how do i know that this was not a political trick that the minister enraged at seeing me in the opposition and jealous of the popular sympathy i excite has not concerted with m debray to ruin me a probable thing why not who ever heard of such an occurrence as this a false telegraphic despatch it is almost impossible for wrong signals to be made as they were in the last two telegrams it was done on purpose for me i am sure of it sir said the baroness humbly are you not aware that the man employed there was dismissed that they talked of going to law with him that orders were issued to arrest him and that this order would have been put into execution if he had not escaped by flight which proves that he was either mad or guilty it was a mistake yes which made fools laugh which caused the minister to have a sleepless night which has caused the ministers secretaries to blacken several sheets of paper but which has cost me francs but sir said hermine suddenly if all this is as you say caused by m debray why instead of going direct to him do you come and tell me of it why to accuse the man do you address the woman do i know m debray do i wish to know him do i wish to know that he gives advice do i wish to follow it do i speculate no you do all this not i still it seems to me that as you profit by it danglars shrugged his shoulders foolish creature he exclaimed women fancy they have talent because they have managed two or three intrigues without being the talk of paris but know that if you had even hidden your irregularities from your husband who has but the commencement of the art for generally husbands will not see you would then have been but a faint imitation of most of your friends among the women of the world but it has not been so with me i see and always have seen during the last sixteen years you may perhaps have hidden a thought but not a step not an action not a fault has escaped me while you flattered yourself upon your address and firmly believed you had deceived me what has been the result that thanks to my pretended ignorance there is none of your friends from m de villefort to m debray who has not trembled before me there is not one who has not treated me as the master of the house the only title i desire with respect to you there is not one in fact who would have dared to speak of me as i have spoken of them this day i will allow you to make me hateful but i will prevent your rendering me ridiculous and above all i forbid you to ruin me the baroness had been tolerably composed until the name of villefort had been pronounced but then she became pale and rising as if touched by a spring she stretched out her hands as though conjuring an apparition she then took two or three steps towards her husband as though to tear the secret from him of which he was ignorant or which he withheld from some odious calculation odious as all his calculations were m de villefort what do you mean i mean that m de nargonne your first husband being neither a philosopher nor a banker or perhaps being both and seeing there was nothing to be got out of a kings attorney died of grief or anger
