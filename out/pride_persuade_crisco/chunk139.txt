for himself and would be looked up to as regulating the modes of life in whatever way he might choose to model his household sir walter would quit kellynch hall and after a very few days more of doubt and indecision the great question of whither he should go was settled and the first outline of this important change made out there had been three alternatives london bath or another house in the country all annes wishes had been for the latter a small house in their own neighbourhood where they might still have lady russells society still be near mary and still have the pleasure of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of kellynch was the object of her ambition but the usual fate of anne attended her in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on she disliked bath and did not think it agreed with her and bath was to be her home sir walter had at first thought more of london but mr shepherd felt that he could not be trusted in london and had been skilful enough to dissuade him from it and make bath preferred it was a much safer place for a gentleman in his predicament he might there be important at comparatively little expense two material advantages of bath over london had of course been given all their weight its more convenient distance from kellynch only fifty miles and lady russells spending some part of every winter there and to the very great satisfaction of lady russell whose first views on the projected change had been for bath sir walter and elizabeth were induced to believe that they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there lady russell felt obliged to oppose her dear annes known wishes it would be too much to expect sir walter to descend into a small house in his own neighbourhood anne herself would have found the mortifications of it more than she foresaw and to sir walters feelings they must have been dreadful and with regard to annes dislike of bath she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising first from the circumstance of her having been three years at school there after her mothers death and secondly from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she had afterwards spent there with herself lady russell was fond of bath in short and disposed to think it must suit them all and as to her young friends health by passing all the warm months with her at kellynch lodge every danger would be avoided and it was in fact a change which must do both health and spirits good anne had been too little from home too little seen her spirits were not high a larger society would improve them she wanted her to be more known the undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood for sir walter was certainly much strengthened by one part and a very material part of the scheme which had been happily engrafted on the beginning he was not only to quit his home but to see it in the hands of others a trial of fortitude which stronger heads than sir walters have found too much kellynch hall was to be let this however was a profound secret not to be breathed beyond their own circle sir walter could not have borne the degradation of being known to design letting his house mr shepherd had once mentioned the word advertise but never dared approach it again sir walter spurned the idea of its being offered in any manner forbad the slightest hint being dropped of his having such an intention and it was only on the supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most unexceptionable applicant on his own terms and as a great favour that he would let it at all how quick come the reasons for approving what we like lady russell had another excellent one at hand for being extremely glad that sir walter and his family were to remove from the country elizabeth had been lately forming an intimacy which she wished to see interrupted it was with the daughter of mr shepherd who had returned after an unprosperous marriage to her fathers house with the additional burden of two children she was a clever young woman who understood the art of pleasing--the art of pleasing at least at kellynch hall and who had made herself so acceptable to miss elliot as to have been already staying there more than once in spite of all that lady russell who thought it a friendship quite out of place could hint of caution and reserve lady russell indeed had scarcely any influence with elizabeth and seemed to love her rather because she would love her than because elizabeth deserved it she had never received from her more than outward attention nothing beyond the observances of complaisance had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry against previous inclination she had been repeatedly very earnest in trying to get anne included in the visit to london sensibly open to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut her out and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience but always in vain elizabeth
