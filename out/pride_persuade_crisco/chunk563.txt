the turning of the first street they would light the lamps as it would be foolish to attract the notice of the police by too many precautions occasionally he shuddered he thought of the moment when from the top of that wall he should protect the descent of his dear valentine pressing in his arms for the first time her of whom he had yet only kissed the delicate hand when the afternoon arrived and he felt that the hour was drawing near he wished for solitude his agitation was extreme a simple question from a friend would have irritated him he shut himself in his room and tried to read but his eye glanced over the page without understanding a word and he threw away the book and for the second time sat down to sketch his plan the ladders and the fence at length the hour drew near never did a man deeply in love allow the clocks to go on peacefully morrel tormented his so effectually that they struck eight at half-past six he then said it is time to start the signature was indeed fixed to take place at nine oclock but perhaps valentine will not wait for that consequently morrel having left the rue meslay at half-past eight by his timepiece entered the clover-field while the clock of saint-philippe-du-roule was striking eight the horse and cabriolet were concealed behind a small ruin where morrel had often waited the night gradually drew on and the foliage in the garden assumed a deeper hue then morrel came out from his hiding-place with a beating heart and looked through the small opening in the gate there was yet no one to be seen the clock struck half-past eight and still another half-hour was passed in waiting while morrel walked to and fro and gazed more and more frequently through the opening the garden became darker still but in the darkness he looked in vain for the white dress and in the silence he vainly listened for the sound of footsteps the house which was discernible through the trees remained in darkness and gave no indication that so important an event as the signature of a marriage-contract was going on morrel looked at his watch which wanted a quarter to ten but soon the same clock he had already heard strike two or three times rectified the error by striking half-past nine this was already half an hour past the time valentine had fixed it was a terrible moment for the young man the slightest rustling of the foliage the least whistling of the wind attracted his attention and drew the perspiration to his brow then he tremblingly fixed his ladder and not to lose a moment placed his foot on the first step amidst all these alternations of hope and fear the clock struck ten it is impossible said maximilian that the signing of a contract should occupy so long a time without unexpected interruptions i have weighed all the chances calculated the time required for all the forms something must have happened and then he walked rapidly to and fro and pressed his burning forehead against the fence had valentine fainted or had she been discovered and stopped in her flight these were the only obstacles which appeared possible to the young man the idea that her strength had failed her in attempting to escape and that she had fainted in one of the paths was the one that most impressed itself upon his mind in that case said he i should lose her and by my own fault he dwelt on this idea for a moment then it appeared reality he even thought he could perceive something on the ground at a distance he ventured to call and it seemed to him that the wind wafted back an almost inarticulate sigh at last the half-hour struck it was impossible to wait longer his temples throbbed violently his eyes were growing dim he passed one leg over the wall and in a moment leaped down on the other side he was on villeforts premises had arrived there by scaling the wall what might be the consequences however he had not ventured thus far to draw back he followed a short distance close under the wall then crossed a path hid entered a clump of trees in a moment he had passed through them and could see the house distinctly m then morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was not illuminated instead of lights at every window as is customary on days of ceremony he saw only a gray mass which was veiled also by a cloud which at that moment obscured the moons feeble light a light moved rapidly from time to time past three windows of the second floor these three windows were in madame de saint-mrans room another remained motionless behind some red curtains which were in madame de villeforts bedroom morrel guessed all this so many times in order to follow valentine in thought at every hour in the day had he made her describe the whole house that without having seen it he knew it all this darkness and silence alarmed morrel still more than valentines absence had done almost mad with grief and determined to venture everything in order to see valentine once more and be certain of
