to her birth all his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount of her fortune before he committed himself depend upon it whatever esteem mr elliot may have for his own situation in life now as a young man he had not the smallest value for it his chance for the kellynch estate was something but all the honour of the family he held as cheap as dirt i have often heard him declare that if baronetcies were saleable anybody should have his for fifty pounds arms and motto name and livery included but i will not pretend to repeat half that i used to hear him say on that subject it would not be fair and yet you ought to have proof for what is all this but assertion and you shall have proof indeed my dear mrs smith i want none cried anne you have asserted nothing contradictory to what mr elliot appeared to be some years ago this is all in confirmation rather of what we used to hear and believe i am more curious to know why he should be so different now but for my satisfaction if you will have the goodness to ring for mary stay i am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet anne seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it did as she was desired the box was brought and placed before her and mrs smith sighing over it as she unlocked it said this is full of papers belonging to him to my husband a small portion only of what i had to look over when i lost him the letter i am looking for was one written by mr elliot to him before our marriage and happened to be saved why one can hardly imagine but he was careless and immethodical like other men about those things and when i came to examine his papers i found it with others still more trivial from different people scattered here and there while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed here it is i would not burn it because being even then very little satisfied with mr elliot i was determined to preserve every document of former intimacy i have now another motive for being glad that i can produce it this was the letter directed to charles smith esq tunbridge wells and dated from london as far back as july dear smith--i have received yours your kindness almost overpowers me i wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common but i have lived three-and-twenty years in the world and have seen none like it at present believe me i have no need of your services being in cash again give me joy i have got rid of sir walter and miss they are gone back to kellynch and almost made me swear to visit them this summer but my first visit to kellynch will be with a surveyor to tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer the baronet nevertheless is not unlikely to marry again he is quite fool enough if he does however they will leave me in peace which may be a decent equivalent for the reversion he is worse than last year i wish i had any name but elliot i am sick of it the name of walter i can drop thank god and i desire you will never insult me with my second w again meaning for the rest of my life to be only yours truly--wm elliot such a letter could not be read without putting anne in a glow and mrs smith observing the high colour in her face said the language i know is highly disrespectful though i have forgot the exact terms i have a perfect impression of the general meaning but it shows you the man mark his professions to my poor husband can any thing be stronger anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of finding such words applied to her father she was obliged to recollect that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter which she had been meditating over and say thank you this is full proof undoubtedly proof of every thing you were saying but why be acquainted with us now i can explain this too cried mrs smith smiling can you really yes i have shewn you mr elliot as he was a dozen years ago and i will shew him as he is now i cannot produce written proof again but i can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire of what he is now wanting and what he is now doing he is no hypocrite now he truly wants to marry you his present attentions to your family are very sincere quite from the heart i will give you my authority his friend colonel wallis colonel wallis you are acquainted with him no it does not come to me in quite
