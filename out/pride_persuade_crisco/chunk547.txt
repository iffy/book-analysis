service sir said the abb with a marked italian accent the mission with which i am charged sir replied the visitor speaking with hesitation is a confidential one on the part of him who fulfils it and him by whom he is employed the abb bowed your probity replied the stranger is so well known to the prefect that he wishes as a magistrate to ascertain from you some particulars connected with the public safety to ascertain which i am deputed to see you it is hoped that no ties of friendship or humane consideration will induce you to conceal the truth provided sir the particulars you wish for do not interfere with my scruples or my conscience i am a priest sir and the secrets of confession for instance must remain between me and god and not between me and human justice do not alarm yourself monsieur we will duly respect your conscience at this moment the abb pressed down his side of the shade and so raised it on the other throwing a bright light on the strangers face while his own remained obscured excuse me abb said the envoy of the prefect of the police but the light tries my eyes very much the abb lowered the shade now sir i am listening go on i will come at once to the point do you know the count of monte cristo you mean monsieur zaccone i presume zaccone is not his name monte cristo monte cristo is the name of an estate or rather of a rock and not a family name well be it so let us not dispute about words and since m de monte cristo and m zaccone are the same absolutely the same let us speak of m zaccone agreed i asked you if you knew him extremely well who is he the son of a rich shipbuilder in malta i know that is the report but as you are aware the police does not content itself with vague reports however replied the abb with an affable smile when that report is in accordance with the truth everybody must believe it the police as well as all the rest are you sure of what you assert what do you mean by that question understand sir i do not in the least suspect your veracity i ask if you are certain of it i knew his father m zaccone ah indeed and when a child i often played with the son in the timber-yards but whence does he derive the title of count you are aware that may be bought in italy everywhere and his immense riches whence does he procure them they may not be so very great how much do you suppose he possesses from one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand livres per annum that is reasonable said the visitor i have heard he had three or four millions two hundred thousand per annum would make four millions of capital but i was told he had four millions per annum that is not probable do you know this island of monte cristo certainly everyone who has come from palermo naples or rome to france by sea must know it since he has passed close to it and must have seen it i am told it is a delightful place it is a rock and why has the count bought a rock for the sake of being a count in italy one must have territorial possessions to be a count you have doubtless heard the adventures of m zaccones youth the fathers no the sons i know nothing certain at that period of his life i lost sight of my young comrade was he in the wars i think he entered the service in what branch in the navy are you not his confessor no sir i believe he is a lutheran a lutheran i say i believe such is the case i do not affirm it besides liberty of conscience is established in france doubtless and we are not now inquiring into his creed but his actions in the name of the prefect of police i ask you what you know of him he passes for a very charitable man our holy father the pope has made him a knight of jesus christ for the services he rendered to the christians in the east he has five or six rings as testimonials from eastern monarchs of his services does he wear them no but he is proud of them he is better pleased with rewards given to the benefactors of man than to his destroyers he is a quaker then exactly he is a quaker with the exception of the peculiar dress has he any friends yes everyone who knows him is his friend but has he any enemies one only what is his name lord wilmore where is he he is in paris just now can he give me any particulars important ones he was in india with zaccone do you know his abode its somewhere in the chausse dantin but i know neither the street nor the number m are you at variance with the englishman i love zaccone and he hates him we are consequently not friends do you think the count of monte cristo had ever been in france before he made this visit to paris to that
