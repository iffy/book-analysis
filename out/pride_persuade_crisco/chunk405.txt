his own peculiar smile not so bad for a man who is to be shot at seven oclock tomorrow morning vampa looked at albert with a kind of admiration he was not insensible to such a proof of courage you are right your excellency he said this must be one of your friends then going to albert he touched him on the shoulder saying will your excellency please to awaken albert stretched out his arms rubbed his eyelids and opened his eyes oh said he is it you captain you should have allowed me to sleep i had such a delightful dream i was dancing the galop at torlonias with the countess g then he drew his watch from his pocket that he might see how time sped half-past one only said he why the devil do you rouse me at this hour to tell you that you are free your excellency my dear fellow replied albert with perfect ease of mind remember for the future napoleons maxim never awaken me but for bad news if you had let me sleep on i should have finished my galop and have been grateful to you all my life so then they have paid my ransom no your excellency well then how am i free a person to whom i can refuse nothing has come to demand you come hither yes hither really then that person is a most amiable person albert looked around and perceived franz what said he is it you my dear franz whose devotion and friendship are thus displayed no not i replied franz but our neighbor the count of monte cristo oh my dear count said albert gayly arranging his cravat and wristbands you are really most kind and i hope you will consider me as under eternal obligations to you in the first place for the carriage and in the next for this visit and he put out his hand to the count who shuddered as he gave his own but who nevertheless did give it the bandit gazed on this scene with amazement he was evidently accustomed to see his prisoners tremble before him and yet here was one whose gay temperament was not for a moment altered as for franz he was enchanted at the way in which albert had sustained the national honor in the presence of the bandit my dear albert he said if you will make haste we shall yet have time to finish the night at torlonias you may conclude your interrupted galop so that you will owe no ill-will to signor luigi who has indeed throughout this whole affair acted like a gentleman you are decidedly right and we may reach the palazzo by two oclock signor luigi continued albert is there any formality to fulfil before i take leave of your excellency none sir replied the bandit you are as free as air well then a happy and merry life to you come gentlemen come and albert followed by franz and the count descended the staircase crossed the square chamber where stood all the bandits hat in hand peppino said the brigand chief give me the torch what are you going to do inquired the count i will show you the way back myself said the captain that is the least honor that i can render to your excellency and taking the lighted torch from the hands of the herdsman he preceded his guests not as a servant who performs an act of civility but like a king who precedes ambassadors on reaching the door he bowed and now your excellency added he allow me to repeat my apologies and i hope you will not entertain any resentment at what has occurred no my dear vampa replied the count besides you compensate for your mistakes in so gentlemanly a way that one almost feels obliged to you for having committed them m gentlemen added the chief turning towards the young men perhaps the offer may not appear very tempting to you but if you should ever feel inclined to pay me a second visit wherever i may be you shall be welcome franz and albert bowed the count went out first then albert franz paused for a moment has your excellency anything to ask me said vampa with a smile yes i have replied franz i am curious to know what work you were perusing with so much attention as we entered csars commentaries said the bandit it is my favorite work well are you coming asked albert yes replied franz here i am and he in his turn left the caves they advanced to the plain ah your pardon said albert turning round will you allow me captain and he lighted his cigar at vampas torch now my dear count he said let us on with all the speed we may i am enormously anxious to finish my night at the duke of braccianos they found the carriage where they had left it the count said a word in arabic to ali and the horses went on at great speed it was just two oclock by alberts watch when the two friends entered into the dancing-room their return was quite an event but as they entered together all uneasiness on alberts account ceased instantly madame said the viscount of morcerf advancing towards the countess yesterday you were so condescending
