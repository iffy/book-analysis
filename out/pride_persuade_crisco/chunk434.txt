into the garden this time i did not content myself with looking but i took my knife out of my pocket felt that the point was sharp and sprang over the wall my first care was to run to the door he had left the key in it taking the simple precaution of turning it twice in the lock nothing then preventing my escape by this means i examined the grounds the garden was long and narrow a stretch of smooth turf extended down the middle and at the corners were clumps of trees with thick and massy foliage that made a background for the shrubs and flowers in order to go from the door to the house or from the house to the door m de villefort would be obliged to pass by one of these clumps of trees m it was the end of september the wind blew violently the faint glimpses of the pale moon hidden momentarily by masses of dark clouds that were sweeping across the sky whitened the gravel walks that led to the house but were unable to pierce the obscurity of the thick shrubberies in which a man could conceal himself without any fear of discovery i hid myself in the one nearest to the path villefort must take and scarcely was i there when amidst the gusts of wind i fancied i heard groans but you know or rather you do not know your excellency that he who is about to commit an assassination fancies that he hears low cries perpetually ringing in his ears two hours passed thus during which i imagined i heard moans repeatedly midnight struck as the last stroke died away i saw a faint light shine through the windows of the private staircase by which we have just descended the door opened and the man in the mantle reappeared the terrible moment had come but i had so long been prepared for it that my heart did not fail in the least i drew my knife from my pocket again opened it and made ready to strike the man in the mantle advanced towards me but as he drew near i saw that he had a weapon in his hand i was afraid not of a struggle but of a failure when he was only a few paces from me i saw that what i had taken for a weapon was only a spade i was still unable to divine for what reason m de villefort had this spade in his hands when he stopped close to the thicket where i was glanced round and began to dig a hole in the earth i then perceived that he was hiding something under his mantle which he laid on the grass in order to dig more freely then i confess curiosity mingled with hatred i wished to see what villefort was going to do there and i remained motionless holding my breath then an idea crossed my mind which was confirmed when i saw the procureur lift from under his mantle a box two feet long and six or eight inches deep i let him place the box in the hole he had made then while he stamped with his feet to remove all traces of his occupation i rushed on him and plunged my knife into his breast exclaiming i am giovanni bertuccio thy death for my brothers thy treasure for his widow thou seest that my vengeance is more complete than i had hoped i know not if he heard these words i think he did not for he fell without a cry i felt his blood gush over my face but i was intoxicated i was delirious and the blood refreshed instead of burning me in a second i had disinterred the box then that it might not be known i had done so i filled up the hole threw the spade over the wall and rushed through the door which i double-locked carrying off the key ah said monte cristo it seems to me this was nothing but murder and robbery no your excellency returned bertuccio it was a vendetta followed by restitution and was the sum a large one it was not money ah i recollect replied the count did you not say something of an infant yes excellency i hastened to the river sat down on the bank and with my knife forced open the lock of the box in a fine linen cloth was wrapped a new-born child its purple visage and its violet-colored hands showed that it had perished from suffocation but as it was not yet cold i hesitated to throw it into the water that ran at my feet after a moment i fancied that i felt a slight pulsation of the heart and as i had been assistant at the hospital at bastia i did what a doctor would have done i inflated the lungs by blowing air into them and at the expiration of a quarter of an hour it began to breathe and cried feebly in my turn i uttered a cry but a cry of joy god has not cursed me then i cried since he permits me to save the life of a human creature in exchange for the life i have taken away m and what did you do with the child asked monte
