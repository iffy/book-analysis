the report of the accident had spread among the workmen and boatmen about the cobb and many were collected near them to be useful if wanted at any rate to enjoy the sight of a dead young lady nay two dead young ladies for it proved twice as fine as the first report to some of the best-looking of these good people henrietta was consigned for though partially revived she was quite helpless and in this manner anne walking by her side and charles attending to his wife they set forward treading back with feelings unutterable the ground which so lately so very lately and so light of heart they had passed along they were not off the cobb before the harvilles met them captain benwick had been seen flying by their house with a countenance which showed something to be wrong and they had set off immediately informed and directed as they passed towards the spot shocked as captain harville was he brought senses and nerves that could be instantly useful and a look between him and his wife decided what was to be done she must be taken to their house all must go to their house and await the surgeons arrival there they would not listen to scruples he was obeyed they were all beneath his roof and while louisa under mrs harvilles direction was conveyed up stairs and given possession of her own bed assistance cordials restoratives were supplied by her husband to all who needed them louisa had once opened her eyes but soon closed them again without apparent consciousness this had been a proof of life however of service to her sister and henrietta though perfectly incapable of being in the same room with louisa was kept by the agitation of hope and fear from a return of her own insensibility mary too was growing calmer the surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible they were sick with horror while he examined but he was not hopeless the head had received a severe contusion but he had seen greater injuries recovered from he was by no means hopeless he spoke cheerfully that he did not regard it as a desperate case that he did not say a few hours must end it was at first felt beyond the hope of most and the ecstasy of such a reprieve the rejoicing deep and silent after a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to heaven had been offered may be conceived the tone the look with which thank god was uttered by captain wentworth anne was sure could never be forgotten by her nor the sight of him afterwards as he sat near a table leaning over it with folded arms and face concealed as if overpowered by the various feelings of his soul and trying by prayer and reflection to calm them louisas limbs had escaped there was no injury but to the head it now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done as to their general situation they were now able to speak to each other and consult that louisa must remain where she was however distressing to her friends to be involving the harvilles in such trouble did not admit a doubt her removal was impossible the harvilles silenced all scruples and as much as they could all gratitude they had looked forward and arranged everything before the others began to reflect captain benwick must give up his room to them and get another bed elsewhere and the whole was settled they were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more and yet perhaps by putting the children away in the maids room or swinging a cot somewhere they could hardly bear to think of not finding room for two or three besides supposing they might wish to stay though with regard to any attendance on miss musgrove there need not be the least uneasiness in leaving her to mrs harvilles care entirely mrs harville was a very experienced nurse and her nursery-maid who had lived with her long and gone about with her everywhere was just such another between these two she could want no possible attendance by day or night and all this was said with a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible charles henrietta and captain wentworth were the three in consultation and for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror uppercross the necessity of some ones going to uppercross the news to be conveyed how it could be broken to mr and mrs musgrove the lateness of the morning an hour already gone since they ought to have been off the impossibility of being in tolerable time at first they were capable of nothing more to the purpose than such exclamations but after a while captain wentworth exerting himself said we must be decided and without the loss of another minute every minute is valuable some one must resolve on being off for uppercross instantly musgrove either you or i must go charles agreed but declared his resolution of not going away he would be as little incumbrance as possible to captain and mrs harville but as to leaving his sister in such a state he neither ought nor would so far it was decided and henrietta at first declared the same she however was soon persuaded
