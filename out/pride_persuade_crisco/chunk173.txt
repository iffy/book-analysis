conceive how extraordinary i wish i had looked at him more i wish we had been aware in time who it was that he might have been introduced to us what a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other do you think he had the elliot countenance i hardly looked at him i was looking at the horses but i think he had something of the elliot countenance i wonder the arms did not strike me oh the great-coat was hanging over the panel and hid the arms so it did otherwise i am sure i should have observed them and the livery too if the servant had not been in mourning one should have known him by the livery putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together said captain wentworth we must consider it to be the arrangement of providence that you should not be introduced to your cousin when she could command mary's attention anne quietly tried to convince her that their father and mr elliot had not for many years been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction at all desirable at the same time however it was a secret gratification to herself to have seen her cousin and to know that the future owner of kellynch was undoubtedly a gentleman and had an air of good sense she would not upon any account mention her having met with him the second time luckily mary did not much attend to their having passed close by him in their earlier walk but she would have felt quite ill-used by anne's having actually run against him in the passage and received his very polite excuses while she had never been near him at all no that cousinly little interview must remain a perfect secret of course said mary you will mention our seeing mr elliot the next time you write to bath i think my father certainly ought to hear of it do mention all about him anne avoided a direct reply but it was just the circumstance which she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated but as what ought to be suppressed the offence which had been given her father many years back she knew elizabeth's particular share in it she suspected and that mr elliot's idea always produced irritation in both was beyond a doubt mary never wrote to bath herself all the toil of keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with elizabeth fell on anne breakfast had not been long over when they were joined by captain and mrs harville and captain benwick with whom they had appointed to take their last walk about lyme they ought to be setting off for uppercross by one and in the meanwhile were to be all together and out of doors as long as they could anne found captain benwick getting near her as soon as they were all fairly in the street their conversation the preceding evening did not disincline him to seek her again and they walked together some time talking as before of mr scott and lord byron and still as unable as before and as unable as any other two readers to think exactly alike of the merits of either till something occasioned an almost general change amongst their party and instead of captain benwick she had captain harville by her side miss elliot said he speaking rather low you have done a good deed in making that poor fellow talk so much i wish he could have such company oftener it is bad for him i know to be shut up as he is but what can we do we cannot part no said anne that i can easily believe to be impossible but in time perhaps--we know what time does in every case of affliction and you must remember captain harville that your friend may yet be called a young mourner--only last summer i understand ay true enough with a deep sigh only june and not known to him perhaps so soon not till the first week of august when he came home from the cape just made into the grappler i was at plymouth dreading to hear of him he sent in letters but the grappler was under orders for portsmouth there the news must follow him but who was to tell it not i i would as soon have been run up to the yard-arm nobody could do it but that good fellow pointing to captain wentworth the laconia had come into plymouth the week before no danger of her being sent to sea again he stood his chance for the rest wrote up for leave of absence but without waiting the return travelled night and day till he got to portsmouth rowed off to the grappler that instant and never left the poor fellow for a week that's what he did and nobody else could have saved poor james you may think miss elliot whether he is dear to us anne did think on the question with perfect decision and said as much in reply as her own feeling could accomplish or as his seemed able to bear for he was too much affected to renew the subject and when he spoke again it was of something totally different mrs harville's giving it as her opinion that her husband would have
