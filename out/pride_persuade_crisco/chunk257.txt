me i entreat but my orders your orders do not forbid your telling me what i must know in ten minutes in half an hour or an hour you see i cannot escape even if i intended unless you are blind or have never been outside the harbor you must know i do not look round you then dants rose and looked forward when he saw rise within a hundred yards of him the black and frowning rock on which stands the chteau dif this gloomy fortress which has for more than three hundred years furnished food for so many wild legends seemed to dants like a scaffold to a malefactor the chteau dif cried he what are we going there for the gendarme smiled i am not going there to be imprisoned said dants it is only used for political prisoners i have committed no crime are there any magistrates or judges at the chteau dif there are only said the gendarme a governor a garrison turnkeys and good thick walls come come do not look so astonished or you will make me think you are laughing at me in return for my good nature dants pressed the gendarmes hand as though he would crush it you think then said he that i am taken to the chteau dif to be imprisoned there it is probable but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard without any inquiry without any formality all the formalities have been gone through the inquiry is already made and so in spite of m de villeforts promises i do not know what m de villefort promised you said the gendarme but i know we are taking you to the chteau dif but what are you doing help comrades help by a rapid movement which the gendarmes practiced eye had perceived dants sprang forward to precipitate himself into the sea but four vigorous arms seized him as his feet quitted the bottom of the boat he fell back cursing with rage good said the gendarme placing his knee on his chest this is the way you keep your word as a sailor believe soft-spoken gentlemen again hark ye my friend i have disobeyed my first order but i will not disobey the second and if you move i will blow your brains out and he levelled his carbine at dants who felt the muzzle against his temple for a moment the idea of struggling crossed his mind and of so ending the unexpected evil that had overtaken him but he bethought him of m de villeforts promise and besides death in a boat from the hand of a gendarme seemed too terrible he remained motionless but gnashing his teeth and wringing his hands with fury at this moment the boat came to a landing with a violent shock one of the sailors leaped on shore a cord creaked as it ran through a pulley and dants guessed they were at the end of the voyage and that they were mooring the boat his guards taking him by the arms and coat-collar forced him to rise and dragged him towards the steps that lead to the gate of the fortress while the police officer carrying a musket with fixed bayonet followed behind dants made no resistance he was like a man in a dream he saw soldiers drawn up on the embankment he knew vaguely that he was ascending a flight of steps he was conscious that he passed through a door and that the door closed behind him but all this indistinctly as through a mist he did not even see the ocean that terrible barrier against freedom which the prisoners look upon with utter despair they halted for a minute during which he strove to collect his thoughts he looked around he was in a court surrounded by high walls he heard the measured tread of sentinels and as they passed before the light he saw the barrels of their muskets shine they waited upwards of ten minutes certain dants could not escape the gendarmes released him they seemed awaiting orders the orders came where is the prisoner said a voice here replied the gendarmes let him follow me i will take him to his cell go said the gendarmes thrusting dants forward the prisoner followed his guide who led him into a room almost under ground whose bare and reeking walls seemed as though impregnated with tears a lamp placed on a stool illumined the apartment faintly and showed dants the features of his conductor an under-jailer ill-clothed and of sullen appearance m here is your chamber for tonight said he it is late and the governor is asleep tomorrow perhaps he may change you in the meantime there is bread water and fresh straw and that is all a prisoner can wish for goodnight and before dants could open his mouth before he had noticed where the jailer placed his bread or the water before he had glanced towards the corner where the straw was the jailer disappeared taking with him the lamp and closing the door leaving stamped upon the prisoners mind the dim reflection of the dripping walls of his dungeon dants was alone in darkness and in silence cold as the shadows that he felt breathe on his burning forehead with the first dawn of day the jailer returned with orders
