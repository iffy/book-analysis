as well as the mouth the blood was pouring in floods she was stone dead i strode past her and ascended to the sleeping chamber which presented an appearance of the wildest disorder the furniture had been knocked over in the deadly struggle that had taken place there and the sheets to which the unfortunate jeweller had doubtless clung were dragged across the room the murdered man lay on the floor his head leaning against the wall and about him was a pool of blood which poured forth from three large wounds in his breast there was a fourth gash in which a long table knife was plunged up to the handle i stumbled over some object i stooped to examine it was the second pistol which had not gone off probably from the powder being wet i approached the jeweller who was not quite dead and at the sound of my footsteps and the creaking of the floor he opened his eyes fixed them on me with an anxious and inquiring gaze moved his lips as though trying to speak then overcome by the effort fell back and expired this appalling sight almost bereft me of my senses and finding that i could no longer be of service to anyone in the house my only desire was to fly i rushed towards the staircase clutching my hair and uttering a groan of horror upon reaching the room below i found five or six custom-house officers and two or three gendarmes all heavily armed they threw themselves upon me i made no resistance i was no longer master of my senses when i strove to speak a few inarticulate sounds alone escaped my lips as i noticed the significant manner in which the whole party pointed to my blood-stained garments i involuntarily surveyed myself and then i discovered that the thick warm drops that had so bedewed me as i lay beneath the staircase must have been the blood of la carconte i pointed to the spot where i had concealed myself what does he mean asked a gendarme one of the officers went to the place i directed he means replied the man upon his return that he got in that way and he showed the hole i had made when i broke through then i saw that they took me for the assassin i recovered force and energy enough to free myself from the hands of those who held me while i managed to stammer forth i did not do it indeed indeed i did not a couple of gendarmes held the muzzles of their carbines against my breast stir but a step said they and you are a dead man why should you threaten me with death cried i when i have already declared my innocence tush tush cried the men keep your innocent stories to tell to the judge at nmes meanwhile come along with us and the best advice we can give you is to do so unresistingly alas resistance was far from my thoughts i was utterly overpowered by surprise and terror and without a word i suffered myself to be handcuffed and tied to a horses tail and thus they took me to nmes i had been tracked by a customs-officer who had lost sight of me near the tavern feeling certain that i intended to pass the night there he had returned to summon his comrades who just arrived in time to hear the report of the pistol and to take me in the midst of such circumstantial proofs of my guilt as rendered all hopes of proving my innocence utterly futile one only chance was left me that of beseeching the magistrate before whom i was taken to cause every inquiry to be made for the abb busoni who had stopped at the inn of the pont du gard on that morning if caderousse had invented the story relative to the diamond and there existed no such person as the abb busoni then indeed i was lost past redemption or at least my life hung upon the feeble chance of caderousse himself being apprehended and confessing the whole truth two months passed away in hopeless expectation on my part while i must do the magistrate the justice to say that he used every means to obtain information of the person i declared could exculpate me if he would caderousse still evaded all pursuit and i had resigned myself to what seemed my inevitable fate my trial was to come on at the approaching assizes when on the th of september that is to say precisely three months and five days after the events which had perilled my life the abb busoni whom i never ventured to believe i should see presented himself at the prison doors saying he understood one of the prisoners wished to speak to him he added that having learned at marseilles the particulars of my imprisonment he hastened to comply with my desire you may easily imagine with what eagerness i welcomed him and how minutely i related the whole of what i had seen and heard i felt some degree of nervousness as i entered upon the history of the diamond but to my inexpressible astonishment he confirmed it in every particular and to my equal surprise he seemed to place entire belief in all i said and
