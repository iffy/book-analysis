you are a smuggler occasionally gaetano your excellency we must live somehow returned the other smiling impenetrably then you know the men who are now on monte cristo oh yes we sailors are like freemasons and recognize each other by signs and do you think we have nothing to fear if we land nothing at all smugglers are not thieves but these two corsican bandits said franz calculating the chances of peril it is not their fault that they are bandits but that of the authorities how so because they are pursued for having made a stiff as if it was not in a corsicans nature to revenge himself what do you mean by having made a stiff having assassinated a man said franz continuing his investigation i mean that they have killed an enemy which is a very different thing returned the captain well said the young man let us demand hospitality of these smugglers and bandits do you think they will grant it without doubt how many are they four and the two bandits make six just our number so that if they prove troublesome we shall be able to hold them in check so for the last time steer to monte cristo yes but your excellency will permit us to take all due precautions by all means be as wise as nestor and as prudent as ulysses i do more than permit i exhort you silence then said gaetano everyone obeyed for a man who like franz viewed his position in its true light it was a grave one he was alone in the darkness with sailors whom he did not know and who had no reason to be devoted to him who knew that he had several thousand francs in his belt and who had often examined his weapons which were very beautiful if not with envy at least with curiosity on the other hand he was about to land without any other escort than these men on an island which had indeed a very religious name but which did not seem to franz likely to afford him much hospitality thanks to the smugglers and bandits the history of the scuttled vessels which had appeared improbable during the day seemed very probable at night placed as he was between two possible sources of danger he kept his eye on the crew and his gun in his hand the sailors had again hoisted sail and the vessel was once more cleaving the waves through the darkness franz whose eyes were now more accustomed to it could see the looming shore along which the boat was sailing and then as they rounded a rocky point he saw the fire more brilliant than ever and about it five or six persons seated the blaze illumined the sea for a hundred paces around gaetano skirted the light carefully keeping the boat in the shadow then when they were opposite the fire he steered to the centre of the circle singing a fishing song of which his companions sung the chorus at the first words of the song the men seated round the fire arose and approached the landing-place their eyes fixed on the boat evidently seeking to know who the new-comers were and what were their intentions they soon appeared satisfied and returned with the exception of one who remained at the shore to their fire at which the carcass of a goat was roasting when the boat was within twenty paces of the shore the man on the beach who carried a carbine presented arms after the manner of a sentinel and cried who comes there in sardinian franz coolly cocked both barrels gaetano then exchanged a few words with this man which the traveller did not understand but which evidently concerned him will your excellency give your name or remain incognito asked the captain my name must rest unknown replied franz merely say i am a frenchman travelling for pleasure as soon as gaetano had transmitted this answer the sentinel gave an order to one of the men seated round the fire who rose and disappeared among the rocks not a word was spoken everyone seemed occupied franz with his disembarkment the sailors with their sails the smugglers with their goat but in the midst of all this carelessness it was evident that they mutually observed each other the man who had disappeared returned suddenly on the opposite side to that by which he had left he made a sign with his head to the sentinel who turning to the boat said saccommodi the italian saccommodi is untranslatable it means at once come enter you are welcome make yourself at home you are the master it is like that turkish phrase of molires that so astonished the bourgeois gentleman by the number of things implied in its utterance the sailors did not wait for a second invitation four strokes of the oar brought them to land gaetano sprang to shore exchanged a few words with the sentinel then his comrades disembarked and lastly came franz one of his guns was swung over his shoulder gaetano had the other and a sailor held his rifle his dress half artist half dandy did not excite any suspicion and consequently no disquietude the boat was moored to the shore and they advanced a few paces to find a comfortable bivouac but doubtless the
