she decided on leaving paris with a nun of her acquaintance they are gone to seek a very strict convent in italy or spain oh it is terrible and m de boville retired with this exclamation after expressing acute sympathy with the father but he had scarcely left before danglars with an energy of action those can alone understand who have seen robert macaire represented by frdrick exclaimed fool then enclosing monte cristos receipt in a little pocket-book he added yes come at twelve oclock i shall then be far away then he double-locked his door emptied all his drawers collected about fifty thousand francs in bank-notes burned several papers left others exposed to view and then commenced writing a letter which he addressed to madame la baronne danglars i will place it on her table myself tonight he murmured then taking a passport from his drawer he said good it is available for two months longer chapter the cemetery of pre-lachaise m de boville had indeed met the funeral procession which was taking valentine to her last home on earth the weather was dull and stormy a cold wind shook the few remaining yellow leaves from the boughs of the trees and scattered them among the crowd which filled the boulevards m de villefort a true parisian considered the cemetery of pre-lachaise alone worthy of receiving the mortal remains of a parisian family there alone the corpses belonging to him would be surrounded by worthy associates he had therefore purchased a vault which was quickly occupied by members of his family on the front of the monument was inscribed the families of saint-mran and villefort for such had been the last wish expressed by poor rene valentines mother the pompous procession therefore wended its way towards pre-lachaise from the faubourg saint-honor having crossed paris it passed through the faubourg du temple then leaving the exterior boulevards it reached the cemetery more than fifty private carriages followed the twenty mourning-coaches and behind them more than five hundred persons joined in the procession on foot m these last consisted of all the young people whom valentines death had struck like a thunderbolt and who notwithstanding the raw chilliness of the season could not refrain from paying a last tribute to the memory of the beautiful chaste and adorable girl thus cut off in the flower of her youth as they left paris an equipage with four horses at full speed was seen to draw up suddenly it contained monte cristo the count left the carriage and mingled in the crowd who followed on foot chteau-renaud perceived him and immediately alighting from his coup joined him beauchamp did the same the count looked attentively through every opening in the crowd he was evidently watching for someone but his search ended in disappointment m where is morrel he asked do either of these gentlemen know where he is we have already asked that question said chteau-renaud for none of us has seen him the count was silent but continued to gaze around him at length they arrived at the cemetery the piercing eye of monte cristo glanced through clusters of bushes and trees and was soon relieved from all anxiety for seeing a shadow glide between the yew-trees monte cristo recognized him whom he sought one funeral is generally very much like another in this magnificent metropolis black figures are seen scattered over the long white avenues the silence of earth and heaven is alone broken by the noise made by the crackling branches of hedges planted around the monuments then follows the melancholy chant of the priests mingled now and then with a sob of anguish escaping from some woman concealed behind a mass of flowers the shadow monte cristo had noticed passed rapidly behind the tomb of ablard and hlose placed itself close to the heads of the horses belonging to the hearse and following the undertakers men arrived with them at the spot appointed for the burial each persons attention was occupied monte cristo saw nothing but the shadow which no one else observed twice the count left the ranks to see whether the object of his interest had any concealed weapon beneath his clothes when the procession stopped this shadow was recognized as morrel who with his coat buttoned up to his throat his face livid and convulsively crushing his hat between his fingers leaned against a tree situated on an elevation commanding the mausoleum so that none of the funeral details could escape his observation everything was conducted in the usual manner a few men the least impressed of all by the scene pronounced a discourse some deploring this premature death others expatiating on the grief of the father and one very ingenious person quoting the fact that valentine had solicited pardon of her father for criminals on whom the arm of justice was ready to fall until at length they exhausted their stores of metaphor and mournful speeches elaborate variations on the stanzas of malherbe to du prier monte cristo heard and saw nothing or rather he only saw morrel whose calmness had a frightful effect on those who knew what was passing in his heart see said beauchamp pointing out morrel to debray what is he doing up there and they called chteau-renauds attention to him how pale he is said chteau-renaud shuddering he is cold said debray
