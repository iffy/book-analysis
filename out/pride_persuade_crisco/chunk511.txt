without any detriment to his mental faculties it is not exactly that sir said the notary which makes me uneasy but the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and intentions so as to be able to get his answers you must see that to be an utter impossibility said villefort valentine and the old man heard this conversation and noirtier fixed his eye so earnestly on valentine that she felt bound to answer to the look sir said she that need not make you uneasy however difficult it may at first sight appear to be i can discover and explain to you my grandfathers thoughts so as to put an end to all your doubts and fears on the subject i have now been six years with m noirtier and let him tell you if ever once during that time he has entertained a thought which he was unable to make me understand no signed the old man let us try what we can do then said the notary you accept this young lady as your interpreter m noirtier yes well sir what do you require of me and what document is it that you wish to be drawn up valentine named all the letters of the alphabet until she came to w at this letter the eloquent eye of noirtier gave her notice that she was to stop it is very evident that it is the letter w which m noirtier wants said the notary wait said valentine and turning to her grandfather she repeated wa we wi the old man stopped her at the last syllable valentine then took the dictionary and the notary watched her while she turned over the pages she passed her finger slowly down the columns and when she came to the word will m noirtiers eye bade her stop will said the notary it is very evident that m noirtier is desirous of making his will yes yes yes motioned the invalid really sir you must allow that this is most extraordinary said the astonished notary turning to m de villefort yes said the procureur and i think the will promises to be yet more extraordinary for i cannot see how it is to be drawn up without the intervention of valentine and she may perhaps be considered as too much interested in its contents to allow of her being a suitable interpreter of the obscure and ill-defined wishes of her grandfather no no no replied the eye of the paralytic what said villefort do you mean to say that valentine is not interested in your will no sir said the notary whose interest had been greatly excited and who had resolved on publishing far and wide the account of this extraordinary and picturesque scene what appeared so impossible to me an hour ago has now become quite easy and practicable and this may be a perfectly valid will provided it be read in the presence of seven witnesses approved by the testator and sealed by the notary in the presence of the witnesses as to the time it will not require very much more than the generality of wills there are certain forms necessary to be gone through and which are always the same as to the details the greater part will be furnished afterwards by the state in which we find the affairs of the testator and by yourself who having had the management of them can doubtless give full information on the subject but besides all this in order that the instrument may not be contested i am anxious to give it the greatest possible authenticity therefore one of my colleagues will help me and contrary to custom will assist in the dictation of the testament are you satisfied sir continued the notary addressing the old man m yes looked the invalid his eye beaming with delight at the ready interpretation of his meaning what is he going to do thought villefort whose position demanded much reserve but who was longing to know what his fathers intentions were he left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent but barrois who had heard all that passed had guessed his masters wishes and had already gone to fetch one the procureur then told his wife to come up in the course of a quarter of an hour everyone had assembled in the chamber of the paralytic the second notary had also arrived a few words sufficed for a mutual understanding between the two officers of the law they read to noirtier the formal copy of a will in order to give him an idea of the terms in which such documents are generally couched then in order to test the capacity of the testator the first notary said turning towards him when an individual makes his will it is generally in favor or in prejudice of some person yes have you an exact idea of the amount of your fortune yes i will name to you several sums which will increase by gradation you will stop me when i reach the one representing the amount of your own possessions yes there was a kind of solemnity in this interrogation never had the struggle between mind and matter been more apparent than now and if it was not a sublime it was at least a curious spectacle they had formed
