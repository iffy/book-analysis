stranger to the particulars of your youngest sisters infamous elopement i know it all that the young mans marrying her was a patched-up business at the expence of your father and uncles and is such a girl to be my nephews sister is her husband who is the son of his late fathers steward to be his brother heaven and earth of what are you thinking are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted you can now have nothing further to say she resentfully answered you have insulted me in every possible method i must beg to return to the house and she rose as she spoke lady catherine rose also and they turned back her ladyship was highly incensed you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew unfeeling selfish girl do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody lady catherine i have nothing further to say you know my sentiments you are then resolved to have him i have said no such thing i am only resolved to act in that manner which will in my own opinion constitute my happiness without reference to you or to any person so wholly unconnected with me it is well you refuse then to oblige me you refuse to obey the claims of duty honour and gratitude you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends and make him the contempt of the world neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied elizabeth have any possible claim on me in the present instance no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with mr darcy and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moments concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn and this is your real opinion this is your final resolve very well i shall now know how to act do not imagine miss bennet that your ambition will ever be gratified i came to try you i hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it i will carry my point in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage when turning hastily round she added i take no leave of you miss bennet i send no compliments to your mother you deserve no such attention i am most seriously displeased elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself she did not choose it said her daughter she would go she is a very fine-looking woman and her calling here was prodigiously civil for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call on you i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lizzy elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible chapter the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly lady catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr darcy it was a rational scheme to be sure but from what the report of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another to supply the idea she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together and her neighbours at lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time in revolving lady catherines expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side with his notions of dignity he
