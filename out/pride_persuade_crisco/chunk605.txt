you which asked the young man that you inherit from your mother truly from my mother leonora corsinari how much may it amount to indeed sir said andrea i assure you i have never given the subject a thought but i suppose it must have been at least two millions danglars felt as much overcome with joy as the miser who finds a lost treasure or as the shipwrecked mariner who feels himself on solid ground instead of in the abyss which he expected would swallow him up well sir said andrea bowing to the banker respectfully may i hope you may not only hope said danglars but consider it a settled thing if no obstacle arises on your part i am indeed rejoiced said andrea but said danglars thoughtfully how is it that your patron m de monte cristo did not make his proposal for you andrea blushed imperceptibly i have just left the count sir said he he is doubtless a delightful man but inconceivably peculiar in his ideas he esteems me highly he even told me he had not the slightest doubt that my father would give me the capital instead of the interest of my property he has promised to use his influence to obtain it for me but he also declared that he never had taken on himself the responsibility of making proposals for another and he never would i must however do him the justice to add that he assured me if ever he had regretted the repugnance he felt to such a step it was on this occasion because he thought the projected union would be a happy and suitable one besides if he will do nothing officially he will answer any questions you propose to him and now continued he with one of his most charming smiles having finished talking to the father-in-law i must address myself to the banker and what may you have to say to him said danglars laughing in his turn that the day after tomorrow i shall have to draw upon you for about four thousand francs but the count expecting my bachelors revenue could not suffice for the coming months outlay has offered me a draft for twenty thousand francs it bears his signature as you see which is all-sufficient bring me a million such as that said danglars i shall be well pleased putting the draft in his pocket fix your own hour for tomorrow and my cashier shall call on you with a check for eighty thousand francs at ten oclock then if you please i should like it early as i am going into the country tomorrow very well at ten oclock you are still at the htel des princes yes the following morning with the bankers usual punctuality the eighty thousand francs were placed in the young mans hands as he was on the point of starting after having left two hundred francs for caderousse he went out chiefly to avoid this dangerous enemy and returned as late as possible in the evening but scarcely had he stepped out of his carriage when the porter met him with a parcel in his hand sir said he that man has been here what man said andrea carelessly apparently forgetting him whom he but too well recollected him to whom your excellency pays that little annuity oh said andrea my fathers old servant well you gave him the two hundred francs i had left for him yes your excellency andrea had expressed a wish to be thus addressed but continued the porter he would not take them andrea turned pale but as it was dark his pallor was not perceptible what he would not take them said he with slight emotion m no he wished to speak to your excellency i told him you were gone out and after some dispute he believed me and gave me this letter which he had brought with him already sealed give it me said andrea and he read by the light of his carriage-lamp you know where i live i expect you tomorrow morning at nine oclock andrea examined it carefully to ascertain if the letter had been opened or if any indiscreet eyes had seen its contents but it was so carefully folded that no one could have read it and the seal was perfect very well said he poor man he is a worthy creature he left the porter to ponder on these words not knowing which most to admire the master or the servant take out the horses quickly and come up to me said andrea to his groom in two seconds the young man had reached his room and burnt caderousses letter the servant entered just as he had finished you are about my height pierre said he i have that honor your excellency you had a new livery yesterday yes sir i have an engagement with a pretty little girl for this evening and do not wish to be known lend me your livery till tomorrow i may sleep perhaps at an inn pierre obeyed five minutes after andrea left the hotel completely disguised took a cabriolet and ordered the driver to take him to the cheval rouge at picpus the next morning he left that inn as he had left the htel des princes without being noticed walked down the faubourg saint-antoine along
