the magnificent count of monte cristo but this simplicity was according to the will of its master who positively ordered nothing to be altered outside the splendor was within indeed almost before the door opened the scene changed m bertuccio had outdone himself in the taste displayed in furnishing and in the rapidity with which it was executed it is told that the duc dantin removed in a single night a whole avenue of trees that annoyed louis xiv in three days m bertuccio planted an entirely bare court with poplars large spreading sycamores to shade the different parts of the house and in the foreground instead of the usual paving-stones half hidden by the grass there extended a lawn but that morning laid down and upon which the water was yet glistening for the rest the orders had been issued by the count he himself had given a plan to bertuccio marking the spot where each tree was to be planted and the shape and extent of the lawn which was to take the place of the paving-stones thus the house had become unrecognizable and bertuccio himself declared that he scarcely knew it encircled as it was by a framework of trees the overseer would not have objected while he was about it to have made some improvements in the garden but the count had positively forbidden it to be touched bertuccio made amends however by loading the antechambers staircases and mantle-pieces with flowers what above all manifested the shrewdness of the steward and the profound science of the master the one in carrying out the ideas of the other was that this house which appeared only the night before so sad and gloomy impregnated with that sickly smell one can almost fancy to be the smell of time had in a single day acquired the aspect of life was scented with its masters favorite perfumes and had the very light regulated according to his wish when the count arrived he had under his touch his books and arms his eyes rested upon his favorite pictures his dogs whose caresses he loved welcomed him in the antechamber the birds whose songs delighted him cheered him with their music and the house awakened from its long sleep like the sleeping beauty in the wood lived sang and bloomed like the houses we have long cherished and in which when we are forced to leave them we leave a part of our souls the servants passed gayly along the fine courtyard some belonging to the kitchens gliding down the stairs restored but the previous day as if they had always inhabited the house others filling the coach-houses where the equipages encased and numbered appeared to have been installed for the last fifty years and in the stables the horses replied with neighs to the grooms who spoke to them with much more respect than many servants pay their masters the library was divided into two parts on either side of the wall and contained upwards of two thousand volumes one division was entirely devoted to novels and even the volume which had been published but the day before was to be seen in its place in all the dignity of its red and gold binding on the other side of the house to match with the library was the conservatory ornamented with rare flowers that bloomed in china jars and in the midst of the greenhouse marvellous alike to sight and smell was a billiard-table which looked as if it had been abandoned during the past hour by players who had left the balls on the cloth one chamber alone had been respected by the magnificent bertuccio before this room to which you could ascend by the grand and go out by the back staircase the servants passed with curiosity and bertuccio with terror at five oclock precisely the count arrived before the house at auteuil followed by ali bertuccio was awaiting this arrival with impatience mingled with uneasiness he hoped for some compliments while at the same time he feared to have frowns monte cristo descended into the courtyard walked all over the house without giving any sign of approbation or pleasure until he entered his bedroom situated on the opposite side to the closed room then he approached a little piece of furniture made of rosewood which he had noticed at a previous visit that can only be to hold gloves he said will your excellency deign to open it said the delighted bertuccio and you will find gloves in it elsewhere the count found everything he required smelling-bottles cigars knick-knacks m good he said and m bertuccio left enraptured so great so powerful and real was the influence exercised by this man over all who surrounded him at precisely six oclock the clatter of horses hoofs was heard at the entrance door it was our captain of spahis who had arrived on mdah i am sure i am the first cried morrel i did it on purpose to have you a minute to myself before everyone came julie and emmanuel
