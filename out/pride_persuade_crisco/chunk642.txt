m sir said maximilian you are not perhaps aware that i am m de monte cristos friend i was not sure but i thought it might be so so much the better the more honorable men there are here the better i shall be satisfied m morrel said chteau-renaud will you apprise the count of monte cristo that m de morcerf is arrived and we are at his disposal morrel was preparing to fulfil his commission beauchamp had meanwhile drawn the box of pistols from the carriage stop gentlemen said albert i have two words to say to the count of monte cristo in private asked morrel no sir before all who are here alberts witnesses looked at each other franz and debray exchanged some words in a whisper and morrel rejoiced at this unexpected incident went to fetch the count who was walking in a retired path with emmanuel what does he want with me said monte cristo i do not know but he wishes to speak to you ah said monte cristo i trust he is not going to tempt me by some fresh insult i do not think that such is his intention said morrel the count advanced accompanied by maximilian and emmanuel his calm and serene look formed a singular contrast to alberts grief-stricken face who approached also followed by the other four young men when at three paces distant from each other albert and the count stopped approach gentlemen said albert i wish you not to lose one word of what i am about to have the honor of saying to the count of monte cristo for it must be repeated by you to all who will listen to it strange as it may appear to you proceed sir said the count sir said albert at first with a tremulous voice but which gradually became firmer i reproached you with exposing the conduct of m de morcerf in epirus for guilty as i knew he was i thought you had no right to punish him but i have since learned that you had that right it is not fernand mondegos treachery towards ali pasha which induces me so readily to excuse you but the treachery of the fisherman fernand towards you and the almost unheard-of miseries which were its consequences and i say and proclaim it publicly that you were justified in revenging yourself on my father and i his son thank you for not using greater severity had a thunderbolt fallen in the midst of the spectators of this unexpected scene it would not have surprised them more than did alberts declaration as for monte cristo his eyes slowly rose towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude he could not understand how alberts fiery nature of which he had seen so much among the roman bandits had suddenly stooped to this humiliation he recognized the influence of mercds and saw why her noble heart had not opposed the sacrifice she knew beforehand would be useless now sir said albert if you think my apology sufficient pray give me your hand next to the merit of infallibility which you appear to possess i rank that of candidly acknowledging a fault but this confession concerns me only i acted well as a man but you have acted better than man an angel alone could have saved one of us from death that angel came from heaven if not to make us friends which alas fatality renders impossible at least to make us esteem each other monte cristo with moistened eye heaving breast and lips half open extended to albert a hand which the latter pressed with a sentiment resembling respectful fear gentlemen said he m de monte cristo receives my apology i had acted hastily towards him hasty actions are generally bad ones now my fault is repaired i hope the world will not call me cowardly for acting as my conscience dictated but if anyone should entertain a false opinion of me added he drawing himself up as if he would challenge both friends and enemies i shall endeavor to correct his mistake what happened during the night asked beauchamp of chteau-renaud we appear to make a very sorry figure here in truth what albert has just done is either very despicable or very noble replied the baron what can it mean said debray to franz the count of monte cristo acts dishonorably to m de morcerf and is justified by his son had i ten yaninas in my family i should only consider myself the more bound to fight ten times as for monte cristo his head was bent down his arms were powerless bowing under the weight of twenty-four years reminiscences he thought not of albert of beauchamp of chteau-renaud or of any of that group but he thought of that courageous woman who had come to plead for her sons life to whom he had offered his and who had now saved it by the revelation of a dreadful family secret capable of destroying forever in that young mans heart every feeling of filial piety providence still murmured he now only am i fully convinced of being the emissary of god chapter mother and son the count of monte cristo bowed to the five young men with a melancholy and dignified smile and got into his carriage with maximilian and emmanuel albert beauchamp
