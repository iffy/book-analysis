ever really suffered in body or mind the only time that i ever fancied myself unwell or had any ideas of danger was the winter that i passed by myself at deal when the admiral captain croft then was in the north seas i lived in perpetual fright at that time and had all manner of imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself or when i should hear from him next but as long as we could be together nothing ever ailed me and i never met with the smallest inconvenience aye to be sure yes indeed oh yes i am quite of your opinion mrs croft was mrs musgrove's hearty answer there is nothing so bad as a separation i am quite of your opinion i know what it is for mr musgrove always attends the assizes and i am so glad when they are over and he is safe back again the evening ended with dancing on its being proposed anne offered her services as usual and though her eyes would sometimes fill with tears as she sat at the instrument she was extremely glad to be employed and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved it was a merry joyous party and no one seemed in higher spirits than captain wentworth she felt that he had every thing to elevate him which general attention and deference and especially the attention of all the young women could do the miss hayters the females of the family of cousins already mentioned were apparently admitted to the honour of being in love with him and as for henrietta and louisa they both seemed so entirely occupied by him that nothing but the continued appearance of the most perfect good-will between themselves could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals if he were a little spoilt by such universal such eager admiration who could wonder these were some of the thoughts which occupied anne while her fingers were mechanically at work proceeding for half an hour together equally without error and without consciousness once she felt that he was looking at herself observing her altered features perhaps trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once charmed him and once she knew that he must have spoken of her she was hardly aware of it till she heard the answer but then she was sure of his having asked his partner whether miss elliot never danced the answer was oh no never she has quite given up dancing she had rather play she is never tired of playing once too he spoke to her she had left the instrument on the dancing being over and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished to give the miss musgroves an idea of unintentionally she returned to that part of the room he saw her and instantly rising said with studied politeness i beg your pardon madam this is your seat and though she immediately drew back with a decided negative he was not to be induced to sit down again anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches his cold politeness his ceremonious grace were worse than anything chapter captain wentworth was come to kellynch as to a home to stay as long as he liked being as thoroughly the object of the admiral's fraternal kindness as of his wife's he had intended on first arriving to proceed very soon into shropshire and visit the brother settled in that country but the attractions of uppercross induced him to put this off there was so much of friendliness and of flattery and of everything most bewitching in his reception there the old were so hospitable the young so agreeable that he could not but resolve to remain where he was and take all the charms and perfections of edward's wife upon credit a little longer it was soon uppercross with him almost every day the musgroves could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come particularly in the morning when he had no companion at home for the admiral and mrs croft were generally out of doors together interesting themselves in their new possessions their grass and their sheep and dawdling about in a way not endurable to a third person or driving out in a gig lately added to their establishment hitherto there had been but one opinion of captain wentworth among the musgroves and their dependencies it was unvarying warm admiration everywhere but this intimate footing was not more than established when a certain charles hayter returned among them to be a good deal disturbed by it and to think captain wentworth very much in the way charles hayter was the eldest of all the cousins and a very amiable pleasing young man between whom and henrietta there had been a considerable appearance of attachment previous to captain wentworth's introduction he was in orders and having a curacy in the neighbourhood where residence was not required lived at his father's house only two miles from uppercross a short absence from home had left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period and when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners and of seeing captain wentworth mrs musgrove and mrs hayter were sisters they
