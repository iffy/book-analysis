she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire was a severe disappointment and besides it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody and had so many favourites she is so fond of mrs forster said she it will be quite shocking to send her away and there are several of the young men too that she likes very much the officers may not be so pleasant in general s regiment his daughters request for such it might be considered of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north received at first an absolute negative but jane and elizabeth who agreed in wishing for the sake of their sisters feelings and consequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly to receive her and her husband at longbourn as soon as they were married that he was prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the north when mr bennet wrote again to his brother therefore he sent his permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon as the ceremony was over they should proceed to longbourn elizabeth was surprised however that wickham should consent to such a scheme and had she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes chapter their sisters wedding day arrived and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself the carriage was sent to meet them at and they were to return in it by dinner-time their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets and jane more especially who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had she been the culprit and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure they came the family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them smiles decked the face of mrs bennet as the carriage drove up to the door her husband looked impenetrably grave her daughters alarmed anxious uneasy lydias voice was heard in the vestibule the door was thrown open and she ran into the room her mother stepped forwards embraced her and welcomed her with rapture gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham who followed his lady and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness their reception from mr bennet to whom they then turned was not quite so cordial his countenance rather gained in austerity and he scarcely opened his lips the easy assurance of the young couple indeed was enough to provoke him elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bennet was shocked lydia was lydia still untamed unabashed wild noisy and fearless she turned from sister to sister demanding their congratulations and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly round the room took notice of some little alteration in it and observed with a laugh that it was a great while since she had been there wickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his manners were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he claimed their relationship would have delighted them all elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance but she sat down resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man she blushed and jane blushed but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour there was no want of discourse the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough and wickham who happened to sit near elizabeth began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world nothing of the past was recollected with pain and lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world only think of its being three months she cried since i went away it seems but a fortnight i declare and yet there have been things enough happened in the time good gracious when i went away i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again though i thought it would be very good fun if i was her father lifted up his eyes jane was distressed elizabeth looked expressively at lydia but she who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible gaily continued oh mamma do the people hereabouts know i am married to-day i was afraid they might not and we overtook william goulding in his curricle so i was determined he should know it and so i let down the side-glass next to him and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame
