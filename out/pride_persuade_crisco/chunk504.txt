in this attempt have almost believed that your spirits must have held converse with each other in some state of being anterior to the present and that you are only now occupied in a reminiscence of the past yes well that is precisely the feeling which i experienced when i first saw that extraordinary man extraordinary did you say yes you have known him for some time then scarcely longer than eight or ten days and do you call a man your friend whom you have only known for eight or ten days ah maximilian i had hoped you set a higher value on the title of friend your logic is most powerful valentine but say what you will i can never renounce the sentiment which has instinctively taken possession of my mind i feel as if it were ordained that this man should be associated with all the good which the future may have in store for me and sometimes it really seems as if his eye was able to see what was to come and his hand endowed with the power of directing events according to his own will he must be a prophet then said valentine smiling indeed said maximilian i have often been almost tempted to attribute to him the gift of prophecy at all events he has a wonderful power of foretelling any future good ah said valentine in a mournful tone do let me see this man maximilian he may tell me whether i shall ever be loved sufficiently to make amends for all i have suffered my poor girl you know him already i know him yes it was he who saved the life of your step-mother and her son the count of monte cristo the same ah cried valentine he is too much the friend of madame de villefort ever to be mine the friend of madame de villefort it cannot be surely valentine you are mistaken no indeed i am not for i assure you his power over our household is almost unlimited courted by my step-mother who regards him as the epitome of human wisdom admired by my father who says he has never before heard such sublime ideas so eloquently expressed idolized by edward who notwithstanding his fear of the counts large black eyes runs to meet him the moment he arrives and opens his hand in which he is sure to find some delightful present m de monte cristo appears to exert a mysterious and almost uncontrollable influence over all the members of our family if such be the case my dear valentine you must yourself have felt or at all events will soon feel the effects of his presence he meets albert de morcerf in italy it is to rescue him from the hands of the banditti he introduces himself to madame danglars it is that he may give her a royal present your step-mother and her son pass before his door it is that his nubian may save them from destruction this man evidently possesses the power of influencing events both as regards men and things i never saw more simple tastes united to greater magnificence his smile is so sweet when he addresses me that i forget it ever can be bitter to others ah valentine tell me if he ever looked on you with one of those sweet smiles if so depend on it you will be happy me said the young girl he never even glances at me on the contrary if i accidentally cross his path he appears rather to avoid me ah he is not generous neither does he possess that supernatural penetration which you attribute to him for if he did he would have perceived that i was unhappy and if he had been generous seeing me sad and solitary he would have used his influence to my advantage and since as you say he resembles the sun he would have warmed my heart with one of his life-giving rays you say he loves you maximilian how do you know that he does all would pay deference to an officer like you with a fierce moustache and a long sabre but they think they may crush a poor weeping girl with impunity ah valentine i assure you you are mistaken if it were otherwise if he treated me diplomatically that is to say like a man who wishes by some means or other to obtain a footing in the house so that he may ultimately gain the power of dictating to its occupants he would if it had been but once have honored me with the smile which you extol so loudly but no he saw that i was unhappy he understood that i could be of no use to him and therefore paid no attention to me whatever who knows but that in order to please madame de villefort and my father he may not persecute me by every means in his power it is not just that he should despise me so without any reason ah forgive me said valentine perceiving the effect which her words were producing on maximilian i have done wrong for i have given utterance to thoughts concerning that man which i did not even know existed in my heart i do not deny the influence of which you speak or that i have not myself
