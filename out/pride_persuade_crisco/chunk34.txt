bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mothers words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr darcy who sat opposite to them her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical what is mr darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear for heavens sake madam speak lower what advantage can it be for you to offend mr darcy you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing nothing that she could say however had any influence her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr darcy though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity at length however mrs bennet had no more to say and lady lucas who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken elizabeth now began to revive but not long was the interval of tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the company by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance but in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song elizabeths eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another marys powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice was weak and her manner affected elizabeth was in agonies she looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly talking to bingley she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however imperturbably grave she looked at her father to entreat his interference lest mary should be singing all night he took the hint and when mary had finished her second song said aloud that will do extremely well child you have delighted us long enough let the other young ladies have time to exhibit mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted and elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her fathers speech was afraid her anxiety had done no good others of the party were now applied to if i said mr collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to the rector of a parish has much to do in the first place he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron he must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment i cannot acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family and with a bow to mr darcy he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room many stared many smiled but no one looked more amused than mr bennet himself while his wife seriously commended mr collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a half-whisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think it
