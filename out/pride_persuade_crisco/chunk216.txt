to ensure that it would now spread farther do come anne cried mary come and look yourself you will be too late if you do not make haste they are parting they are shaking hands he is turning away not know mr elliot indeed you seem to have forgot all about lyme to pacify mary and perhaps screen her own embarrassment anne did move quietly to the window she was just in time to ascertain that it really was mr elliot which she had never believed before he disappeared on one side as mrs clay walked quickly off on the other and checking the surprise which she could not but feel at such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons of totally opposite interest she calmly said yes it is mr elliot certainly he has changed his hour of going i suppose that is all or i may be mistaken i might not attend and walked back to her chair recomposed and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well the visitors took their leave and charles having civilly seen them off and then made a face at them and abused them for coming began with well mother i have done something for you that you will like i have been to the theatre and secured a box for to-morrow night ant i a good boy i know you love a play and there is room for us all it holds nine i have engaged captain wentworth anne will not be sorry to join us i am sure we all like a play have not i done well mother mrs musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness for the play if henrietta and all the others liked it when mary eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming good heavens charles how can you think of such a thing take a box for to-morrow night have you forgot that we are engaged to camden place to-morrow night and that we were most particularly asked to meet lady dalrymple and her daughter and mr elliot and all the principal family connexions on purpose to be introduced to them how can you be so forgetful phoo phoo replied charles whats an evening party never worth remembering your father might have asked us to dinner i think if he had wanted to see us you may do as you like but i shall go to the play oh charles i declare it will be too abominable if you do when you promised to go no i did not promise i only smirked and bowed and said the word happy there was no promise but you must go charles it would be unpardonable to fail we were asked on purpose to be introduced there was always such a great connexion between the dalrymples and ourselves nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately we are quite near relations you know and mr elliot too whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with every attention is due to mr elliot consider my fathers heir the future representative of the family dont talk to me about heirs and representatives cried charles i am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising sun if i would not go for the sake of your father i should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir what is mr elliot to me the careless expression was life to anne who saw that captain wentworth was all attention looking and listening with his whole soul and that the last words brought his enquiring eyes from charles to herself charles and mary still talked on in the same style he half serious and half jesting maintaining the scheme for the play and she invariably serious most warmly opposing it and not omitting to make it known that however determined to go to camden place herself she should not think herself very well used if they went to the play without her mrs musgrove interposed we had better put it off charles you had much better go back and change the box for tuesday it would be a pity to be divided and we should be losing miss anne too if there is a party at her fathers and i am sure neither henrietta nor i should care at all for the play if miss anne could not be with us anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness and quite as much so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying if it depended only on my inclination maam the party at home excepting on marys account would not be the smallest impediment i have no pleasure in the sort of meeting and should be too happy to change it for a play and with you but it had better not be attempted perhaps she had spoken it but she trembled when it was done conscious that her words were listened to and daring not even to try to observe their effect it was soon generally agreed that tuesday should be the day charles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife by persisting that he would go to the play to-morrow if nobody else would captain wentworth left his seat and walked to the fire-place probably for the sake of walking away from it
