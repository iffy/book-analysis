sit down it seems you have nothing better to do than to make the acquaintance of this new lord ruthven and you are already the best friends in the world without being so far advanced as that my dear countess returned franz i cannot deny that we have abused his good nature all day all day yes this morning we breakfasted with him we rode in his carriage all day and now we have taken possession of his box you know him then yes and no how so it is a long story tell it to me it would frighten you too much so much the more reason at least wait until the story has a conclusion very well i prefer complete histories but tell me how you made his acquaintance did anyone introduce you to him no it was he who introduced himself to us when last night after we left you through what medium the very prosaic one of our landlord he is staying then at the htel de londres with you not only in the same hotel but on the same floor what is his name for of course you know the count of monte cristo that is not a family name no it is the name of the island he has purchased and he is a count a tuscan count well we must put up with that said the countess who was herself from one of the oldest venetian families what sort of a man is he ask the vicomte de morcerf you hear m de morcerf i am referred to you said the countess we should be very hard to please madam returned albert did we not think him delightful a friend of ten years standing could not have done more for us or with a more perfect courtesy come observed the countess smiling i see my vampire is only some millionaire who has taken the appearance of lara in order to avoid being confounded with m de rothschild and you have seen her her m the beautiful greek of yesterday no we heard i think the sound of her guzla but she remained perfectly invisible when you say invisible interrupted albert it is only to keep up the mystery for whom do you take the blue domino at the window with the white curtains where was this window with white hangings asked the countess at the rospoli palace the count had three windows at the rospoli palace yes did you pass through the corso yes well did you notice two windows hung with yellow damask and one with white damask with a red cross those were the counts windows why he must be a nabob do you know what those three windows were worth two or three hundred roman crowns two or three thousand the deuce does his island produce him such a revenue it does not bring him a bajocco then why did he purchase it for a whim he is an original then in reality observed albert he seemed to me somewhat eccentric were he at paris and a frequenter of the theatres i should say he was a poor devil literally mad this morning he made two or three exits worthy of didier or anthony at this moment a fresh visitor entered and according to custom franz gave up his seat to him this circumstance had moreover the effect of changing the conversation an hour afterwards the two friends returned to their hotel signor pastrini had already set about procuring their disguises for the morrow and he assured them that they would be perfectly satisfied the next morning at nine oclock he entered franzs room followed by a tailor who had eight or ten roman peasant costumes on his arm they selected two exactly alike and charged the tailor to sew on each of their hats about twenty yards of ribbon and to procure them two of the long silk sashes of different colors with which the lower orders decorate themselves on fte days albert was impatient to see how he looked in his new dress a jacket and breeches of blue velvet silk stockings with clocks shoes with buckles and a silk waistcoat this picturesque attire set him off to great advantage and when he had bound the scarf around his waist and when his hat placed coquettishly on one side let fall on his shoulder a stream of ribbons franz was forced to confess that costume has much to do with the physical superiority we accord to certain nations the turks used to be so picturesque with their long and flowing robes but are they not now hideous with their blue frocks buttoned up to the chin and their red caps which make them look like a bottle of wine with a red seal franz complimented albert who looked at himself in the glass with an unequivocal smile of satisfaction they were thus engaged when the count of monte cristo entered m gentlemen said he although a companion is agreeable perfect freedom is sometimes still more agreeable i come to say that today and for the remainder of the carnival i leave the carriage entirely at your disposal the host will tell you i have three or four more so that you will not inconvenience me in any way make use of it i pray you for your pleasure or your
