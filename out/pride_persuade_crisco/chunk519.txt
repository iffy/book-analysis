gardener not in the least since there is no danger that anyone can possibly understand what we are saying i have been told said the count that you do not always yourselves understand the signals you repeat that is true sir and that is what i like best said the man smiling why do you like that best because then i have no responsibility i am a machine then and nothing else and so long as i work nothing more is required of me is it possible said monte cristo to himself that i can have met with a man that has no ambition that would spoil my plans sir said the gardener glancing at the sun-dial the ten minutes are almost up i must return to my post will you go up with me i follow you monte cristo entered the tower which was divided into three stories the tower contained implements such as spades rakes watering-pots hung against the wall this was all the furniture the second was the mans conventional abode or rather sleeping-place it contained a few poor articles of household furniture a bed a table two chairs a stone pitcher and some dry herbs hung up to the ceiling which the count recognized as sweet peas and of which the good man was preserving the seeds he had labelled them with as much care as if he had been master botanist in the jardin des plantes does it require much study to learn the art of telegraphing asked monte cristo the study does not take long it was acting as a supernumerary that was so tedious and what is the pay a thousand francs sir it is nothing no but then we are lodged as you perceive monte cristo looked at the room they passed to the third story it was the telegraph room monte cristo looked in turn at the two iron handles by which the machine was worked it is very interesting he said but it must be very tedious for a lifetime yes at first my neck was cramped with looking at it but at the end of a year i became used to it and then we have our hours of recreation and our holidays holidays yes when when we have a fog ah to be sure those are indeed holidays to me i go into the garden i plant i prune i trim i kill the insects all day long how long have you been here ten years and five as a supernumerary make fifteen you are fifty-five years old how long must you have served to claim the pension oh sir twenty-five years and how much is the pension a hundred crowns poor humanity murmured monte cristo what did you say sir asked the man i was saying it was very interesting what was all you were showing me and you really understand none of these signals none at all and have you never tried to understand them never why should i but still there are some signals only addressed to you certainly and do you understand them they are always the same and they mean nothing new you have an hour or tomorrow this is simple enough said the count but look is not your correspondent putting itself in motion ah yes thank you sir and what is it saying anything you understand yes it asks if i am ready and you reply by the same sign which at the same time tells my right-hand correspondent that i am ready while it gives notice to my left-hand correspondent to prepare in his turn it is very ingenious said the count you will see said the man proudly in five minutes he will speak i have then five minutes said monte cristo to himself it is more time than i require my dear sir will you allow me to ask you a question what is it sir you are fond of gardening passionately and you would be pleased to have instead of this terrace of twenty feet an enclosure of two acres sir i should make a terrestrial paradise of it you live badly on your thousand francs badly enough but yet i do live yes but you have a wretchedly small garden true the garden is not large and then such as it is it is filled with dormice who eat everything ah they are my scourges tell me should you have the misfortune to turn your head while your right-hand correspondent was telegraphing i should not see him then what would happen i could not repeat the signals and then not having repeated them through negligence i should be fined how much a hundred francs the tenth of your income that would be fine work ah said the man has it ever happened to you said monte cristo once sir when i was grafting a rose-tree well suppose you were to alter a signal and substitute another ah that is another case i should be turned off and lose my pension three hundred francs a hundred crowns yes sir so you see that i am not likely to do any of these things not even for fifteen years wages come it is worth thinking about for fifteen thousand francs yes sir you alarm me nonsense sir you are tempting me just so fifteen thousand francs do you understand sir
