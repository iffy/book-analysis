least forty and yet it was easy to understand that he was formed to rule the young men with whom he associated at present and to complete his resemblance with the fantastic heroes of the english poet the count seemed to have the power of fascination albert was constantly expatiating on their good fortune in meeting such a man franz was less enthusiastic but the count exercised over him also the ascendency a strong mind always acquires over a mind less domineering he thought several times of the project the count had of visiting paris and he had no doubt but that with his eccentric character his characteristic face and his colossal fortune he would produce a great effect there and yet he did not wish to be at paris when the count was there the evening passed as evenings mostly pass at italian theatres that is not in listening to the music but in paying visits and conversing the countess g wished to revive the subject of the count but franz announced he had something far newer to tell her and in spite of alberts demonstrations of false modesty he informed the countess of the great event which had preoccupied them for the last three days as similar intrigues are not uncommon in italy if we may credit travellers the comtess did not manifest the least incredulity but congratulated albert on his success they promised upon separating to meet at the duke of braccianos ball to which all rome was invited the heroine of the bouquet kept her word she gave albert no sign of her existence the morrow or the day after at length tuesday came the last and most tumultuous day of the carnival on tuesday the theatres open at ten oclock in the morning as lent begins after eight at night on tuesday all those who through want of money time or enthusiasm have not been to see the carnival before mingle in the gayety and contribute to the noise and excitement from two oclock till five franz and albert followed in the fte exchanging handfuls of confetti with the other carriages and the pedestrians who crowded amongst the horses feet and the carriage wheels without a single accident a single dispute or a single fight the ftes are veritable pleasure days to the italians the author of this history who has resided five or six years in italy does not recollect to have ever seen a ceremony interrupted by one of those events so common in other countries albert was triumphant in his harlequin costume a knot of rose-colored ribbons fell from his shoulder almost to the ground in order that there might be no confusion franz wore his peasants costume as the day advanced the tumult became greater there was not on the pavement in the carriages at the windows a single tongue that was silent a single arm that did not move it was a human storm made up of a thunder of cries and a hail of sweetmeats flowers eggs oranges and nosegays at three oclock the sound of fireworks let off on the piazza del popolo and the piazza di venezia heard with difficulty amid the din and confusion announced that the races were about to begin the races like the moccoli are one of the episodes peculiar to the last days of the carnival at the sound of the fireworks the carriages instantly broke ranks and retired by the adjacent streets all these evolutions are executed with an inconceivable address and marvellous rapidity without the police interfering in the matter the pedestrians ranged themselves against the walls then the trampling of horses and the clashing of steel were heard a detachment of carbineers fifteen abreast galloped up the corso in order to clear it for the barberi when the detachment arrived at the piazza di venezia a second volley of fireworks was discharged to announce that the street was clear almost instantly in the midst of a tremendous and general outcry seven or eight horses excited by the shouts of three hundred thousand spectators passed by like lightning then the castle of saint angelo fired three cannon to indicate that number three had won immediately without any other signal the carriages moved on flowing on towards the corso down all the streets like torrents pent up for a while which again flow into the parent river and the immense stream again continued its course between its two granite banks a new source of noise and movement was added to the crowd the sellers of moccoletti entered on the scene the moccoli or moccoletti are candles which vary in size from the pascal taper to the rushlight and which give to each actor in the great final scene of the carnival two very serious problems to grapple with first how to keep his own moccoletto alight and secondly how to extinguish the moccoletti of others the moccoletto is like life man has found but one means of transmitting it and that one comes from god but he has discovered a thousand means of taking it away and the devil has somewhat aided him the moccoletto is kindled by approaching it to a light but who can describe the thousand means of
