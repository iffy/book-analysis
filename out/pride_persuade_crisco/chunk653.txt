to destruction by some exterminating angel as an object of gods anger ah indeed said monte cristo looking earnestly at the young man and by an imperceptible movement turning his chair so that he remained in the shade while the light fell full on maximilians face yes continued morrel death had entered that house twice within one month and what did the doctor answer asked monte cristo he replied he replied that the death was not a natural one and must be attributed to what to poison indeed said monte cristo with a slight cough which in moments of extreme emotion helped him to disguise a blush or his pallor or the intense interest with which he listened indeed maximilian did you hear that yes my dear count i heard it and the doctor added that if another death occurred in a similar way he must appeal to justice monte cristo listened or appeared to do so with the greatest calmness well said maximilian death came a third time and neither the master of the house nor the doctor said a word death is now perhaps striking a fourth blow count what am i bound to do being in possession of this secret my dear friend said monte cristo you appear to be relating an adventure which we all know by heart i know the house where you heard it or one very similar to it a house with a garden a master a physician and where there have been three unexpected and sudden deaths well i have not intercepted your confidence and yet i know all that as well as you and i have no conscientious scruples no it does not concern me you say an exterminating angel appears to have devoted that house to gods anger well who says your supposition is not reality do not notice things which those whose interest it is to see them pass over if it is gods justice instead of his anger which is walking through that house maximilian turn away your face and let his justice accomplish its purpose morrel shuddered there was something mournful solemn and terrible in the counts manner besides continued he in so changed a tone that no one would have supposed it was the same person speaking besides who says that it will begin again it has returned count exclaimed morrel that is why i hastened to you well what do you wish me to do do you wish me for instance to give information to the procureur monte cristo uttered the last words with so much meaning that morrel starting up cried out you know of whom i speak count do you not perfectly well my good friend and i will prove it to you by putting the dots to the i or rather by naming the persons you were walking one evening in m de villeforts garden from what you relate i suppose it to have been the evening of madame de saint-mrans death you heard m de villefort talking to m davrigny about the death of m de saint-mran and that no less surprising of the countess m davrigny said he believed they both proceeded from poison and you honest man have ever since been asking your heart and sounding your conscience to know if you ought to expose or conceal this secret we are no longer in the middle ages there is no longer a vehmgericht or free tribunals what do you want to ask these people conscience what hast thou to do with me as sterne said my dear fellow let them sleep on if they are asleep let them grow pale in their drowsiness if they are disposed to do so and pray do you remain in peace who have no remorse to disturb you deep grief was depicted on morrels features he seized monte cristos hand but it is beginning again i say well said the count astonished at his perseverance which he could not understand and looking still more earnestly at maximilian let it begin again it is like the house of the atreidae god has condemned them and they must submit to their punishment they will all disappear like the fabrics children build with cards and which fall one by one under the breath of their builder even if there are two hundred of them three months since it was m de saint-mran madame de saint-mran two months since the other day it was barrois today the old noirtier or young valentine you knew it cried morrel in such a paroxysm of terror that monte cristo started he whom the falling heavens would have found unmoved you knew it and said nothing and what is it to me replied monte cristo shrugging his shoulders do i know those people and must i lose the one to save the other faith no for between the culprit and the victim i have no choice but i cried morrel groaning with sorrow i love her you love whom cried monte cristo starting to his feet and seizing the two hands which morrel was raising towards heaven i love most fondly i love madly i love as a man who would give his life-blood to spare her a tear i love valentine de villefort who is being murdered at this moment do you understand me i love her and i ask god and
