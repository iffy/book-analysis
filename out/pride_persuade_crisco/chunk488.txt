close to morcerfs face it was as if the young girl beheld the head of medusa she bent forwards as though to assure herself of the reality of what she saw then uttering a faint cry threw herself back in her seat the sound was heard by the people about ali who instantly opened the box-door why count exclaimed eugnie what has happened to your ward she seems to have been taken suddenly ill very probably answered the count but do not be alarmed on her account haydes nervous system is delicately organized and she is peculiarly susceptible to the odors even of flowers nay there are some which cause her to faint if brought into her presence however continued monte cristo drawing a small phial from his pocket i have an infallible remedy so saying he bowed to the baroness and her daughter exchanged a parting shake of the hand with debray and the count and left madame danglars box upon his return to hayde he found her still very pale as soon as she saw him she seized his hand her own hands were moist and icy cold who was it you were talking with over there she asked with the count of morcerf answered monte cristo he tells me he served your illustrious father and that he owes his fortune to him wretch exclaimed hayde her eyes flashing with rage he sold my father to the turks and the fortune he boasts of was the price of his treachery did not you know that my dear lord something of this i heard in epirus said monte cristo but the particulars are still unknown to me you shall relate them to me my child they are no doubt both curious and interesting yes yes but let us go i feel as though it would kill me to remain long near that dreadful man so saying hayde arose and wrapping herself in her burnouse of white cashmere embroidered with pearls and coral she hastily quitted the box at the moment when the curtain was rising upon the fourth act do you observe said the countess g to albert who had returned to her side that man does nothing like other people he listens most devoutly to the third act of robert le diable and when the fourth begins takes his departure chapter a flurry in stocks some days after this meeting albert de morcerf visited the count of monte cristo at his house in the champs-lyses which had already assumed that palace-like appearance which the counts princely fortune enabled him to give even to his most temporary residences he came to renew the thanks of madame danglars which had been already conveyed to the count through the medium of a letter signed baronne danglars ne hermine de servieux albert was accompanied by lucien debray who joining in his friends conversation added some passing compliments the source of which the counts talent for finesse easily enabled him to guess he was convinced that luciens visit was due to a double feeling of curiosity the larger half of which sentiment emanated from the rue de la chausse dantin in short madame danglars not being able personally to examine in detail the domestic economy and household arrangements of a man who gave away horses worth francs and who went to the opera with a greek slave wearing diamonds to the amount of a million of money had deputed those eyes by which she was accustomed to see to give her a faithful account of the mode of life of this incomprehensible person but the count did not appear to suspect that there could be the slightest connection between luciens visit and the curiosity of the baroness you are in constant communication with the baron danglars the count inquired of albert de morcerf yes count you know what i told you all remains the same then in that quarter it is more than ever a settled thing said lucien and considering that this remark was all that he was at that time called upon to make he adjusted the glass to his eye and biting the top of his gold headed cane began to make the tour of the apartment examining the arms and the pictures ah said monte cristo i did not expect that the affair would be so promptly concluded oh things take their course without our assistance while we are forgetting them they are falling into their appointed order and when again our attention is directed to them we are surprised at the progress they have made towards the proposed end my father and m danglars served together in spain my father in the army and m danglars in the commissariat department it was there that my father ruined by the revolution and m danglars who never had possessed any patrimony both laid the foundations of their different fortunes yes said monte cristo i think m danglars mentioned that in a visit which i paid him and continued he casting a side-glance at lucien who was turning over the leaves of an album mademoiselle eugnie is pretty i think i remember that to be her name very pretty or rather very beautiful replied albert but of that style of beauty which i do not appreciate i am an ungrateful fellow you speak as if you were already her husband ah returned albert
