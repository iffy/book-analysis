he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting to prevail on mr bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could to the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only security for her husbands not being killed in a duel mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces she shared in their attendance on mrs bennet and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom their other aunt also visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of cheering and heartening them up though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickhams extravagance or irregularity she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who but three months before had been almost an angel of light he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place and his intrigues all honoured with the title of seduction had been extended into every tradesmans family everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness elizabeth though she did not credit above half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of her sisters ruin more certain and even jane who believed still less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some news of them mr gardiner left longbourn on sunday on tuesday his wife received a letter from him it told them that on his arrival he had immediately found out his brother and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street that mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham before his arrival but without gaining any satisfactory information and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town as mr bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first coming to london before they procured lodgings mr gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it he added that mr bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised to write again very soon there was also a postscript to this effect i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out if possible from some of the young mans intimates in the regiment whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself if there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that it might be of essential consequence at present we have nothing to guide us colonel forster will i dare say do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head but on second thoughts perhaps lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her authority proceeded but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved she had never heard of his having had any relations except a father and mother both of whom had been dead many years it was possible however that some of his companions in the shire might be able to give more information and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it the application was a something to look forward to every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected the arrival of letters was the grand object of every mornings impatience through letters whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance but before they heard again from mr gardiner a letter arrived for their father from a different quarter from mr collins which as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence she accordingly read and elizabeth who knew what curiosities his letters always were looked over her and read it likewise it was as follows my dear sir i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire be assured my dear sir that mrs collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family in your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune or that may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a
