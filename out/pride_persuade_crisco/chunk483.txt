but this chase-loving diana continually surrounded by her nymphs gives me a sort of alarm lest she should some day bring on me the fate of acton and indeed it required but one glance at mademoiselle danglars to comprehend the justness of morcerfs remark she was beautiful but her beauty was of too marked and decided a character to please a fastidious taste her hair was raven black but its natural waves seemed somewhat rebellious her eyes of the same color as her hair were surmounted by well-arched brows whose great defect however consisted in an almost habitual frown while her whole physiognomy wore that expression of firmness and decision so little in accordance with the gentler attributes of her sex her nose was precisely what a sculptor would have chosen for a chiselled juno her mouth which might have been found fault with as too large displayed teeth of pearly whiteness rendered still more conspicuous by the brilliant carmine of her lips contrasting vividly with her naturally pale complexion but that which completed the almost masculine look morcerf found so little to his taste was a dark mole of much larger dimensions than these freaks of nature generally are placed just at the corner of her mouth and the effect tended to increase the expression of self-dependence that characterized her countenance the rest of mademoiselle eugnies person was in perfect keeping with the head just described she indeed reminded one of diana as chteau-renaud observed but her bearing was more haughty and resolute as regarded her attainments the only fault to be found with them was the same that a fastidious connoisseur might have found with her beauty that they were somewhat too erudite and masculine for so young a person she was a perfect linguist a first-rate artist wrote poetry and composed music to the study of the latter she professed to be entirely devoted following it with an indefatigable perseverance assisted by a schoolfellow a young woman without fortune whose talent promised to develop into remarkable powers as a singer it was rumored that she was an object of almost paternal interest to one of the principal composers of the day who excited her to spare no pains in the cultivation of her voice which might hereafter prove a source of wealth and independence but this counsel effectually decided mademoiselle danglars never to commit herself by being seen in public with one destined for a theatrical life and acting upon this principle the bankers daughter though perfectly willing to allow mademoiselle louise darmilly that was the name of the young virtuosa to practice with her through the day took especial care not to be seen in her company still though not actually received at the htel danglars in the light of an acknowledged friend louise was treated with far more kindness and consideration than is usually bestowed on a governess the curtain fell almost immediately after the entrance of madame danglars into her box the band quitted the orchestra for the accustomed half-hours interval allowed between the acts and the audience were left at liberty to promenade the salon or lobbies or to pay and receive visits in their respective boxes morcerf and chteau-renaud were amongst the first to avail themselves of this permission for an instant the idea struck madame danglars that this eagerness on the part of the young viscount arose from his impatience to join her party and she whispered her expectations to her daughter that albert was hurrying to pay his respects to them mademoiselle eugnie however merely returned a dissenting movement of the head while with a cold smile she directed the attention of her mother to an opposite box on the first circle in which sat the countess g and where morcerf had just made his appearance m so we meet again my travelling friend do we cried the countess extending her hand to him with all the warmth and cordiality of an old acquaintance it was really very good of you to recognize me so quickly and still more so to bestow your first visit on me be assured replied albert that if i had been aware of your arrival in paris and had known your address i should have paid my respects to you before this allow me to introduce my friend baron de chteau-renaud one of the few true gentlemen now to be found in france and from whom i have just learned that you were a spectator of the races in the champ-de-mars yesterday chteau-renaud bowed to the countess so you were at the races baron inquired the countess eagerly yes madame well then pursued madame g with considerable animation you can probably tell me who won the jockey club stakes i am sorry to say i cannot replied the baron and i was just asking the same question of albert are you very anxious to know countess asked albert to know what the name of the owner of the winning horse excessively only imagine but do tell me viscount whether you really are acquainted with it or no i beg your pardon madame but you were about to relate some story were you not you said only imagine and then paused pray continue well then listen you must know i felt so interested in the splendid roan horse with his elegant little rider so tastefully dressed in a
