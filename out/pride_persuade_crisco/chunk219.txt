settle on a small income at once and have to struggle with a few difficulties together than be involved in a long engagement i always think that no mutual oh dear mrs croft cried mrs musgrove unable to let her finish her speech there is nothing i so abominate for young people as a long engagement it is what i always protested against for my children it is all very well i used to say for young people to be engaged if there is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months or even in twelve but a long engagement yes dear maam said mrs croft or an uncertain engagement an engagement which may be long to begin without knowing that at such a time there will be the means of marrying i hold to be very unsafe and unwise and what i think all parents should prevent as far as they can anne found an unexpected interest here she felt its application to herself felt it in a nervous thrill all over her and at the same moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table captain wentworths pen ceased to move his head was raised pausing listening and he turned round the next instant to give a look one quick conscious look at her the two ladies continued to talk to re-urge the same admitted truths and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation but anne heard nothing distinctly it was only a buzz of words in her ear her mind was in confusion captain harville who had in truth been hearing none of it now left his seat and moved to a window and anne seeming to watch him though it was from thorough absence of mind became gradually sensible that he was inviting her to join him where he stood he looked at her with a smile and a little motion of the head which expressed come to me i have something to say and the unaffected easy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance than he really was strongly enforced the invitation she roused herself and went to him the window at which he stood was at the other end of the room from where the two ladies were sitting and though nearer to captain wentworths table not very near as she joined him captain harvilles countenance re-assumed the serious thoughtful expression which seemed its natural character look here said he unfolding a parcel in his hand and displaying a small miniature painting do you know who that is certainly captain benwick yes and you may guess who it is for but in a deep tone it was not done for her miss elliot do you remember our walking together at lyme and grieving for him i little thought then--but no matter this was drawn at the cape he met with a clever young german artist at the cape and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister sat to him and was bringing it home for her and i have now the charge of getting it properly set for another it was a commission to me but who else was there to employ i hope i can allow for him i am not sorry indeed to make it over to another he undertakes it looking towards captain wentworth he is writing about it now and with a quivering lip he wound up the whole by adding poor fanny she would not have forgotten him so soon no replied anne in a low feeling voice that i can easily believe it was not in her nature she doted on him it would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved captain harville smiled as much as to say do you claim that for your sex and she answered the question smiling also yes we certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us it is perhaps our fate rather than our merit we cannot help ourselves we live at home quiet confined and our feelings prey upon us you are forced on exertion you have always a profession pursuits business of some sort or other to take you back into the world immediately and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men which however i do not think i shall grant it does not apply to benwick he has not been forced upon any exertion the peace turned him on shore at the very moment and he has been living with us in our little family circle ever since true said anne very true i did not recollect but what shall we say now captain harville if the change be not from outward circumstances it must be from within it must be nature mans nature which has done the business for captain benwick no no it is not mans nature i will not allow it to be more mans nature than womans to be inconstant and forget those they do love or have loved i believe the reverse i believe in a true analogy between our bodily frames and our mental and that as our bodies are the strongest so are our feelings capable of bearing most rough usage and
