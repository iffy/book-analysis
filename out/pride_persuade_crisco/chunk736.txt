there is something true in what you say said the count with that smile which made him so handsome i have descended from a planet called grief m i believe all you tell me without questioning its meaning for instance you told me to live and i did live you told me to hope and i almost did so i am almost inclined to ask you as though you had experienced death is it painful to die monte cristo looked upon morrel with indescribable tenderness yes he said yes doubtless it is painful if you violently break the outer covering which obstinately begs for life if you plunge a dagger into your flesh if you insinuate a bullet into your brain which the least shock disorders then certainly you will suffer pain and you will repent quitting a life for a repose you have bought at so dear a price yes i know that there is a secret of luxury and pain in death as well as in life the only thing is to understand it you have spoken truly maximilian according to the care we bestow upon it death is either a friend who rocks us gently as a nurse or an enemy who violently drags the soul from the body some day when the world is much older and when mankind will be masters of all the destructive powers in nature to serve for the general good of humanity when mankind as you were just saying have discovered the secrets of death then that death will become as sweet and voluptuous as a slumber in the arms of your beloved and if you wished to die you would choose this death count yes morrel extended his hand now i understand he said why you had me brought here to this desolate spot in the midst of the ocean to this subterranean palace it was because you loved me was it not count it was because you loved me well enough to give me one of those sweet means of death of which we were speaking a death without agony a death which allows me to fade away while pronouncing valentines name and pressing your hand yes you have guessed rightly morrel said the count that is what i intended thanks the idea that tomorrow i shall no longer suffer is sweet to my heart do you then regret nothing no replied morrel not even me asked the count with deep emotion morrels clear eye was for the moment clouded then it shone with unusual lustre and a large tear rolled down his cheek what said the count do you still regret anything in the world and yet die oh i entreat you exclaimed morrel in a low voice do not speak another word count do not prolong my punishment the count fancied that he was yielding and this belief revived the horrible doubt that had overwhelmed him at the chteau dif i am endeavoring he thought to make this man happy i look upon this restitution as a weight thrown into the scale to balance the evil i have wrought now supposing i am deceived supposing this man has not been unhappy enough to merit happiness alas what would become of me who can only atone for evil by doing good m then he said aloud listen morrel i see your grief is great but still you do not like to risk your soul morrel smiled sadly count he said i swear to you my soul is no longer my own maximilian you know i have no relation in the world i have accustomed myself to regard you as my son well then to save my son i will sacrifice my life nay even my fortune what do you mean i mean that you wish to quit life because you do not understand all the enjoyments which are the fruits of a large fortune morrel i possess nearly a hundred millions and i give them to you with such a fortune you can attain every wish are you ambitious every career is open to you overturn the world change its character yield to mad ideas be even criminal but live count i have your word said morrel coldly then taking out his watch he added it is half-past eleven morrel can you intend it in my house under my very eyes then let me go said maximilian or i shall think you did not love me for my own sake but for yours and he arose it is well said monte cristo whose countenance brightened at these words you wish it you are inflexible yes as you said you are indeed wretched and a miracle alone can cure you sit down morrel and wait morrel obeyed the count arose and unlocking a closet with a key suspended from his gold chain took from it a little silver casket beautifully carved and chased the corners of which represented four bending figures similar to the caryatides the forms of women symbols of the angels aspiring to heaven he placed the casket on the table then opening it took out a little golden box the top of which flew open when touched by a secret spring this box contained an unctuous substance partly solid of which it was impossible to discover the color owing to the reflection of the polished gold sapphires rubies
