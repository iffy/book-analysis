pink satin jacket and cap that i could not help praying for their success with as much earnestness as though the half of my fortune were at stake and when i saw them outstrip all the others and come to the winning-post in such gallant style i actually clapped my hands with joy imagine my surprise when upon returning home the first object i met on the staircase was the identical jockey in the pink jacket i concluded that by some singular chance the owner of the winning horse must live in the same hotel as myself but as i entered my apartments i beheld the very gold cup awarded as a prize to the unknown horse and rider inside the cup was a small piece of paper on which were written these words from lord ruthven to countess g precisely i was sure of it said morcerf sure of what that the owner of the horse was lord ruthven himself what lord ruthven do you mean why our lord ruthven the vampire of the salle argentina is it possible exclaimed the countess is he here in paris to be sure why not and you visit him meet him at your own house and elsewhere i assure you he is my most intimate friend and m de chteau-renaud has also the honor of his acquaintance but why are you so sure of his being the winner of the jockey club prize was not the winning horse entered by the name of vampa what of that why do you not recollect the name of the celebrated bandit by whom i was made prisoner oh yes and from whose hands the count extricated me in so wonderful a manner to be sure i remember it all now he called himself vampa you see its evident where the count got the name but what could have been his motive for sending the cup to me in the first place because i had spoken much of you to him as you may believe and in the second because he delighted to see a countrywoman take so lively an interest in his success i trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish remarks we used to make about him i should not like to affirm upon oath that i have not besides his presenting you the cup under the name of lord ruthven oh but that is dreadful why the man must owe me a fearful grudge does his action appear like that of an enemy no certainly not well then and so he is in paris yes and what effect does he produce why said albert he was talked about for a week then the coronation of the queen of england took place followed by the theft of mademoiselle marss diamonds and so people talked of something else my good fellow said chteau-renaud the count is your friend and you treat him accordingly do not believe what albert is telling you countess so far from the sensation excited in the parisian circles by the appearance of the count of monte cristo having abated i take upon myself to declare that it is as strong as ever his first astounding act upon coming amongst us was to present a pair of horses worth francs to madame danglars his second the almost miraculous preservation of madame de villeforts life now it seems that he has carried off the prize awarded by the jockey club i therefore maintain in spite of morcerf that not only is the count the object of interest at this present moment but also that he will continue to be so for a month longer if he pleases to exhibit an eccentricity of conduct which after all may be his ordinary mode of existence perhaps you are right said morcerf meanwhile who is in the russian ambassadors box which box do you mean asked the countess the one between the pillars on the first tier it seems to have been fitted up entirely afresh did you observe anyone during the first act asked chteau-renaud where in that box no replied the countess it was certainly empty during the first act then resuming the subject of their previous conversation she said and so you really believe it was your mysterious count of monte cristo that gained the prize i am sure of it and who afterwards sent the cup to me undoubtedly but i dont know him said the countess i have a great mind to return it do no such thing i beg of you he would only send you another formed of a magnificent sapphire or hollowed out of a gigantic ruby it is his way and you must take him as you find him at this moment the bell rang to announce the drawing up of the curtain for the second act albert rose to return to his place shall i see you again asked the countess at the end of the next act with your permission i will come and inquire whether there is anything i can do for you in paris pray take notice said the countess that my present residence is rue de rivoli and that i am at home to my friends every saturday evening so now you are both forewarned the young men bowed and quitted the box upon reaching their stalls they found
