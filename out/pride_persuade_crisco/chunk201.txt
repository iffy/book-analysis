of the heart to such a woman he ought not he does not either from the consciousness however that his friend had recovered or from other consciousness he went no farther and anne who in spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered and in spite of all the various noises of the room the almost ceaseless slam of the door and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through had distinguished every word was struck gratified confused and beginning to breathe very quick and feel an hundred things in a moment it was impossible for her to enter on such a subject and yet after a pause feeling the necessity of speaking and having not the smallest wish for a total change she only deviated so far as to say you were a good while at lyme i think about a fortnight i could not leave it till louisas doing well was quite ascertained i had been too deeply concerned in the mischief to be soon at peace it had been my doing solely mine she would not have been obstinate if i had not been weak the country round lyme is very fine i walked and rode a great deal and the more i saw the more i found to admire i should very much like to see lyme again said anne indeed i should not have supposed that you could have found anything in lyme to inspire such a feeling the horror and distress you were involved in the stretch of mind the wear of spirits i should have thought your last impressions of lyme must have been strong disgust the last hours were certainly very painful replied anne but when pain is over the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure one does not love a place the less for having suffered in it unless it has been all suffering nothing but suffering which was by no means the case at lyme we were only in anxiety and distress during the last two hours and previously there had been a great deal of enjoyment so much novelty and beauty i have travelled so little that every fresh place would be interesting to me but there is real beauty at lyme and in short with a faint blush at some recollections altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable as she ceased the entrance door opened again and the very party appeared for whom they were waiting lady dalrymple lady dalrymple was the rejoicing sound and with all the eagerness compatible with anxious elegance sir walter and his two ladies stepped forward to meet her lady dalrymple and miss carteret escorted by mr elliot and colonel wallis who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant advanced into the room the others joined them and it was a group in which anne found herself also necessarily included she was divided from captain wentworth their interesting almost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time but slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on she had learnt in the last ten minutes more of his feelings towards louisa more of all his feelings than she dared to think of and she gave herself up to the demands of the party to the needful civilities of the moment with exquisite though agitated sensations she was in good humour with all she had received ideas which disposed her to be courteous and kind to all and to pity every one as being less happy than herself the delightful emotions were a little subdued when on stepping back from the group to be joined again by captain wentworth she saw that he was gone she was just in time to see him turn into the concert room he was gone he had disappeared she felt a moments regret but they should meet again he would look for her he would find her out before the evening were over and at present perhaps it was as well to be asunder she was in need of a little interval for recollection upon lady russells appearance soon afterwards the whole party was collected and all that remained was to marshal themselves and proceed into the concert room and be of all the consequence in their power draw as many eyes excite as many whispers and disturb as many people as they could very very happy were both elizabeth and anne elliot as they walked in elizabeth arm in arm with miss carteret and looking on the broad back of the dowager viscountess dalrymple before her had nothing to wish for which did not seem within her reach and anne--but it would be an insult to the nature of annes felicity to draw any comparison between it and her sisters the origin of one all selfish vanity of the other all generous attachment anne saw nothing thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room her happiness was from within her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed but she knew nothing about it she was thinking only of the last half hour and as they passed to their seats her mind took a hasty range over it his choice of subjects his expressions and still more his manner and look had been such as she could see in only one light his opinion of louisa musgroves
