a hand as powerful as that of an enchanter oh cried julie i have not lost all hope of some day kissing that hand as i now kiss the purse which he has touched four years ago penelon was at trieste penelon count is the old sailor you saw in the garden and who from quartermaster has become gardener penelon when he was at trieste saw on the quay an englishman who was on the point of embarking on board a yacht and he recognized him as the person who called on my father the fifth of june and who wrote me this letter on the fifth of september he felt convinced of his identity but he did not venture to address him an englishman said monte cristo who grew uneasy at the attention with which julie looked at him an englishman you say yes replied maximilian an englishman who represented himself as the confidential clerk of the house of thomson french at rome it was this that made me start when you said the other day at m de morcerfs that messrs thomson french were your bankers that happened as i told you in for gods sake tell me did you know this englishman but you tell me also that the house of thomson french have constantly denied having rendered you this service yes then is it not probable that this englishman may be someone who grateful for a kindness your father had shown him and which he himself had forgotten has taken this method of requiting the obligation everything is possible in this affair even a miracle what was his name asked monte cristo he gave no other name answered julie looking earnestly at the count than that at the end of his letter sinbad the sailor which is evidently not his real name but a fictitious one then noticing that julie was struck with the sound of his voice tell me continued he was he not about my height perhaps a little taller with his chin imprisoned as it were in a high cravat his coat closely buttoned up and constantly taking out his pencil oh do you then know him cried julie whose eyes sparkled with joy no returned monte cristo i only guessed i knew a lord wilmore who was constantly doing actions of this kind without revealing himself he was an eccentric being and did not believe in the existence of gratitude oh heaven exclaimed julie clasping her hands in what did he believe then m he did not credit it at the period which i knew him said monte cristo touched to the heart by the accents of julies voice but perhaps since then he has had proofs that gratitude does exist and do you know this gentleman monsieur inquired emmanuel oh if you do know him cried julie can you tell us where he is where we can find him maximilian emmanuel if we do but discover him he must believe in the gratitude of the heart monte cristo felt tears start into his eyes and he again walked hastily up and down the room in the name of heaven said maximilian if you know anything of him tell us what it is alas cried monte cristo striving to repress his emotion if lord wilmore was your unknown benefactor i fear you will never see him again i parted from him two years ago at palermo and he was then on the point of setting out for the most remote regions so that i fear he will never return oh monsieur this is cruel of you said julie much affected and the young ladys eyes swam with tears madame replied monte cristo gravely and gazing earnestly on the two liquid pearls that trickled down julies cheeks had lord wilmore seen what i now see he would become attached to life for the tears you shed would reconcile him to mankind and he held out his hand to julie who gave him hers carried away by the look and accent of the count but continued she lord wilmore had a family or friends he must have known someone can we not oh it is useless to inquire returned the count perhaps after all he was not the man you seek for he was my friend he had no secrets from me and if this had been so he would have confided in me and he told you nothing not a word nothing that would lead you to suppose nothing and yet you spoke of him at once ah in such a case one supposes sister sister said maximilian coming to the counts aid monsieur is quite right recollect what our excellent father so often told us it was no englishman that thus saved us monte cristo started what did your father tell you m morrel said he eagerly my father thought that this action had been miraculously performed he believed that a benefactor had arisen from the grave to save us oh it was a touching superstition monsieur and although i did not myself believe it i would not for the world have destroyed my fathers faith how often did he muse over it and pronounce the name of a dear friend a friend lost to him forever and on his death-bed when the near approach of eternity seemed to have illumined his mind with
