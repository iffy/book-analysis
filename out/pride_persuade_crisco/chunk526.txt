appearance hung with red damask which i know not why appeared to me quite dramatic why so said danglars why dramatic can we account for instinct said monte cristo are there not some places where we seem to breathe sadness why we cannot tell it is a chain of recollections an idea which carries you back to other times to other places which very likely have no connection with the present time and place and there is something in this room which reminds me forcibly of the chamber of the marquise de ganges or desdemona stay since we have finished dinner i will show it to you and then we will take coffee in the garden after dinner the play monte cristo looked inquiringly at his guests madame de villefort rose monte cristo did the same and the rest followed their example villefort and madame danglars remained for a moment as if rooted to their seats they questioned each other with vague and stupid glances did you hear said madame danglars we must go replied villefort offering his arm the others attracted by curiosity were already scattered in different parts of the house for they thought the visit would not be limited to the one room and that at the same time they would obtain a view of the rest of the building of which monte cristo had created a palace each one went out by the open doors monte cristo waited for the two who remained then when they had passed he brought up the rear and on his face was a smile which if they could have understood it would have alarmed them much more than a visit to the room they were about to enter they began by walking through the apartments many of which were fitted up in the eastern style with cushions and divans instead of beds and pipes instead of furniture the drawing-rooms were decorated with the rarest pictures by the old masters the boudoirs hung with draperies from china of fanciful colors fantastic design and wonderful texture at length they arrived at the famous room there was nothing particular about it excepting that although daylight had disappeared it was not lighted and everything in it was old-fashioned while the rest of the rooms had been redecorated these two causes were enough to give it a gloomy aspect oh cried madame de villefort it is really frightful madame danglars tried to utter a few words but was not heard many observations were made the import of which was a unanimous opinion that there was something sinister about the room m is it not so asked monte cristo look at that large clumsy bed hung with such gloomy blood-colored drapery and those two crayon portraits that have faded from the dampness do they not seem to say with their pale lips and staring eyes we have seen villefort became livid madame danglars fell into a long seat placed near the chimney oh said madame de villefort smiling are you courageous enough to sit down upon the very seat perhaps upon which the crime was committed madame danglars rose suddenly and then said monte cristo this is not all what is there more said debray who had not failed to notice the agitation of madame danglars ah what else is there said danglars for at present i cannot say that i have seen anything extraordinary what do you say m cavalcanti ah said he we have at pisa ugolinos tower at ferrara tassos prison at rimini the room of francesca and paolo yes but you have not this little staircase said monte cristo opening a door concealed by the drapery look at it and tell me what you think of it what a wicked-looking crooked staircase said chteau-renaud with a smile i do not know whether the wine of chios produces melancholy but certainly everything appears to me black in this house said debray ever since valentines dowry had been mentioned morrel had been silent and sad can you imagine said monte cristo some othello or abb de ganges one stormy dark night descending these stairs step by step carrying a load which he wishes to hide from the sight of man if not from god madame danglars half fainted on the arm of villefort who was obliged to support himself against the wall ah madame cried debray what is the matter with you how pale you look it is very evident what is the matter with her said madame de villefort m de monte cristo is relating horrible stories to us doubtless intending to frighten us to death yes said villefort really count you frighten the ladies what is the matter asked debray in a whisper of madame danglars nothing she replied with a violent effort i want air that is all will you come into the garden said debray advancing towards the back staircase no no she answered i would rather remain here are you really frightened madame said monte cristo oh no sir said madame danglars but you suppose scenes in a manner which gives them the appearance of reality m ah yes said monte cristo smiling it is all a matter of imagination why should we not imagine this the apartment of an honest mother and this bed with red hangings a bed visited by the goddess lucina and that mysterious staircase the passage
