of news follows another and there is often great dissimilarity between them ah said the count i see that m danglars is accustomed to play at gaining or losing francs in a day he must be enormously rich it is not he who plays exclaimed lucien it is madame danglars she is indeed daring but you who are a reasonable being lucien and who knows how little dependence is to be placed on the news since you are at the fountain-head surely you ought to prevent it said morcerf with a smile how can i if her husband fails in controlling her asked lucien you know the character of the baroness no one has any influence with her and she does precisely what she pleases ah if i were in your place said albert well i would reform her it would be rendering a service to her future son-in-law how would you set about it ah that would be easy enough i would give her a lesson a lesson yes your position as secretary to the minister renders your authority great on the subject of political news you never open your mouth but the stockbrokers immediately stenograph your words cause her to lose a hundred thousand francs and that would teach her prudence i do not understand stammered lucien it is very clear notwithstanding replied the young man with an artlessness wholly free from affectation tell her some fine morning an unheard-of piece of intelligence some telegraphic despatch of which you alone are in possession for instance that henri iv was seen yesterday at gabrielles that would boom the market she will buy heavily and she will certainly lose when beauchamp announces the following day in his gazette the report circulated by some usually well-informed persons that the king was seen yesterday at gabrielles house is totally without foundation we can positively assert that his majesty did not quit the pont-neuf lucien half smiled monte cristo although apparently indifferent had not lost one word of this conversation and his penetrating eye had even read a hidden secret in the embarrassed manner of the secretary this embarrassment had completely escaped albert but it caused lucien to shorten his visit he was evidently ill at ease the count in taking leave of him said something in a low voice to which he answered willingly count i accept the count returned to young morcerf do you not think on reflection said he to him that you have done wrong in thus speaking of your mother-in-law in the presence of m debray my dear count said morcerf i beg of you not to apply that title so prematurely now speaking without any exaggeration is your mother really so very much averse to this marriage so much so that the baroness very rarely comes to the house and my mother has not i think visited madame danglars twice in her whole life then said the count i am emboldened to speak openly to you m danglars is my banker m de villefort has overwhelmed me with politeness in return for a service which a casual piece of good fortune enabled me to render him i predict from all this an avalanche of dinners and routs now in order not to presume on this and also to be beforehand with them i have if agreeable to you thought of inviting m and madame danglars and m and madame de villefort to my country-house at auteuil if i were to invite you and the count and countess of morcerf to this dinner i should give it the appearance of being a matrimonial meeting or at least madame de morcerf would look upon the affair in that light especially if baron danglars did me the honor to bring his daughter in that case your mother would hold me in aversion and i do not at all wish that on the contrary i desire to stand high in her esteem indeed count said morcerf i thank you sincerely for having used so much candor towards me and i gratefully accept the exclusion which you propose you say you desire my mothers good opinion i assure you it is already yours to a very unusual extent m do you think so said monte cristo with interest oh i am sure of it we talked of you an hour after you left us the other day but to return to what we were saying if my mother could know of this attention on your part and i will venture to tell her i am sure that she will be most grateful to you it is true that my father will be equally angry the count laughed well said he to morcerf but i think your father will not be the only angry one m and madame danglars will think me a very ill-mannered person they know that i am intimate with you that you are in fact one of the oldest of my parisian acquaintances and they will not find you at my house they will certainly ask me why i did not invite you be sure to provide yourself with some previous engagement which shall have a semblance of probability and communicate the fact to me by a line in writing you know that with bankers nothing but a written document will be valid i will do better than that said albert
