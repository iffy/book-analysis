business the young men wished to decline but they could find no good reason for refusing an offer which was so agreeable to them the count of monte cristo remained a quarter of an hour with them conversing on all subjects with the greatest ease he was as we have already said perfectly well acquainted with the literature of all countries a glance at the walls of his salon proved to franz and albert that he was a connoisseur of pictures a few words he let fall showed them that he was no stranger to the sciences and he seemed much occupied with chemistry the two friends did not venture to return the count the breakfast he had given them it would have been too absurd to offer him in exchange for his excellent table the very inferior one of signor pastrini they told him so frankly and he received their excuses with the air of a man who appreciated their delicacy albert was charmed with the counts manners and he was only prevented from recognizing him for a perfect gentleman by reason of his varied knowledge the permission to do what he liked with the carriage pleased him above all for the fair peasants had appeared in a most elegant carriage the preceding evening and albert was not sorry to be upon an equal footing with them at half-past one they descended the coachman and footman had put on their livery over their disguises which gave them a more ridiculous appearance than ever and which gained them the applause of franz and albert albert had fastened the faded bunch of violets to his button-hole at the first sound of the bell they hastened into the corso by the via vittoria at the second turn a bunch of fresh violets thrown from a carriage filled with harlequins indicated to albert that like himself and his friend the peasants had changed their costume also and whether it was the result of chance or whether a similar feeling had possessed them both while he had donned their costume they had assumed his albert placed the fresh bouquet in his button-hole but he kept the faded one in his hand and when he again met the calash he raised it to his lips an action which seemed greatly to amuse not only the fair lady who had thrown it but her joyous companions also the day was as gay as the preceding one perhaps even more animated and noisy the count appeared for an instant at his window but when they again passed he had disappeared it is almost needless to say that the flirtation between albert and the fair peasant continued all day in the evening on his return franz found a letter from the embassy informing him that he would have the honor of being received by his holiness the next day at each previous visit he had made to rome he had solicited and obtained the same favor and incited as much by a religious feeling as by gratitude he was unwilling to quit the capital of the christian world without laying his respectful homage at the feet of one of st peters successors who has set the rare example of all the virtues he did not then think of the carnival for in spite of his condescension and touching kindness one cannot incline ones self without awe before the venerable and noble old man called gregory xvi on his return from the vatican franz carefully avoided the corso he brought away with him a treasure of pious thoughts to which the mad gayety of the maskers would have been profanation at ten minutes past five albert entered overjoyed the harlequin had reassumed her peasants costume and as she passed she raised her mask she was charming franz congratulated albert who received his congratulations with the air of a man conscious that they are merited he had recognized by certain unmistakable signs that his fair incognita belonged to the aristocracy he had made up his mind to write to her the next day franz remarked while he gave these details that albert seemed to have something to ask of him but that he was unwilling to ask it he insisted upon it declaring beforehand that he was willing to make any sacrifice the other wished albert let himself be pressed just as long as friendship required and then avowed to franz that he would do him a great favor by allowing him to occupy the carriage alone the next day albert attributed to franzs absence the extreme kindness of the fair peasant in raising her mask franz was not sufficiently egotistical to stop albert in the middle of an adventure that promised to prove so agreeable to his curiosity and so flattering to his vanity he felt assured that the perfect indiscretion of his friend would duly inform him of all that happened and as during three years that he had travelled all over italy a similar piece of good fortune had never fallen to his share franz was by no means sorry to learn how to act on such an occasion he therefore promised albert that he would content himself the morrow with witnessing the carnival from the windows of the rospoli palace the next morning he saw albert pass and repass holding an enormous bouquet which he doubtless meant to
