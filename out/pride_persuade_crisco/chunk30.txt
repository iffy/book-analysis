kitty and lydia chapter till elizabeth entered the drawing-room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her she had dressed with more than usual care and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr darcys pleasure in the bingleys invitation to the officers and though this was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend denny to whom lydia eagerly applied and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before and was not yet returned adding with a significant smile i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickhams absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite enquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make attendance forbearance patience with darcy was injury to wickham she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him and turned away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr bingley whose blind partiality provoked her but elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on her spirits and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she had not seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin and to point him out to her particular notice the first two dances however brought a return of distress they were dances of mortification mr collins awkward and solemn apologising instead of attending and often moving wrong without being aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give the moment of her release from him was ecstasy she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of wickham and of hearing that he was universally liked when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with her when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that without knowing what she did she accepted him he walked away again immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind charlotte tried to console her i dare say you will find him very agreeable heaven forbid that would be the greatest misfortune of all to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate do not wish me such an evil when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim her hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy and reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding it they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance he replied and was again silent after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with it is your turn to say something now mr darcy i talked about the dance and you ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said very well that reply will do for the present perhaps by and by i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones but now we may be silent do you talk by rule then while you are dancing sometimes one must speak a little you know it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great
