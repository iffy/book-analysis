you may be fit for the evening i wish sarah was here to doctor you but i am no doctor myself charles ring and order a chair she must not walk but the chair would never do worse than all to lose the possibility of speaking two words to captain wentworth in the course of her quiet solitary progress up the town and she felt almost certain of meeting him could not be borne the chair was earnestly protested against and mrs musgrove who thought only of one sort of illness having assured herself with some anxiety that there had been no fall in the case that anne had not at any time lately slipped down and got a blow on her head that she was perfectly convinced of having had no fall could part with her cheerfully and depend on finding her better at night anxious to omit no possible precaution anne struggled and said i am afraid maam that it is not perfectly understood pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening i am afraid there had been some mistake and i wish you particularly to assure captain harville and captain wentworth that we hope to see them both oh my dear it is quite understood i give you my word captain harville has no thought but of going do you think so but i am afraid and i should be so very sorry will you promise me to mention it when you see them again you will see them both this morning i dare say do promise me to be sure i will if you wish it charles if you see captain harville anywhere remember to give miss annes message but indeed my dear you need not be uneasy captain harville holds himself quite engaged ill answer for it and captain wentworth the same i dare say anne could do no more but her heart prophesied some mischance to damp the perfection of her felicity it could not be very lasting however even if he did not come to camden place himself it would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence by captain harville another momentary vexation occurred charles in his real concern and good nature would go home with her there was no preventing him this was almost cruel but she could not be long ungrateful he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmiths to be of use to her and she set off with him with no feeling but gratitude apparent they were on union street when a quicker step behind a something of familiar sound gave her two moments preparation for the sight of captain wentworth he joined them but as if irresolute whether to join or to pass on said nothing only looked anne could command herself enough to receive that look and not repulsively the cheeks which had been pale now glowed and the movements which had hesitated were decided he walked by her side presently struck by a sudden thought charles said captain wentworth which way are you going only to gay street or farther up the town i hardly know replied captain wentworth surprised are you going as high as belmont are you going near camden place because if you are i shall have no scruple in asking you to take my place and give anne your arm to her fathers door she is rather done for this morning and must not go so far without help and i ought to be at that fellows in the market place he promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment that i might see it and if i do not turn back now i have no chance by his description a good deal like the second size double-barrel of mine which you shot with one day round winthrop there could not be an objection there could be only the most proper alacrity a most obliging compliance for public view and smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture in half a minute charles was at the bottom of union street again and the other two proceeding together and soon words enough had passed between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel walk where the power of conversation would make the present hour a blessing indeed and prepare it for all the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow there they exchanged again those feelings and those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything but which had been followed by so many many years of division and estrangement there they returned again into the past more exquisitely happy perhaps in their re-union than when it had been first projected more tender more tried more fixed in a knowledge of each others character truth and attachment more equal to act more justified in acting and there as they slowly paced the gradual ascent heedless of every group around them seeing neither sauntering politicians bustling housekeepers flirting girls nor nursery-maids and children they could indulge in those retrospections and acknowledgements and especially in those explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment which were so poignant and so ceaseless in
