ask her how she did when we were rather surprised not to find captain benwick of the party for he had been invited as well as the harvilles and what do you think was the reason neither more nor less than his being in love with louisa and not choosing to venture to uppercross till he had had an answer from mr musgrove for it was all settled between him and her before she came away and he had written to her father by captain harville true upon my honour are not you astonished i shall be surprised at least if you ever received a hint of it for i never did mrs musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter we are all very well pleased however for though it is not equal to her marrying captain wentworth it is infinitely better than charles hayter and mr musgrove has written his consent and captain benwick is expected to-day mrs harville says her husband feels a good deal on his poor sisters account but however louisa is a great favourite with both indeed mrs harville and i quite agree that we love her the better for having nursed her charles wonders what captain wentworth will say but if you remember i never thought him attached to louisa i never could see anything of it and this is the end you see of captain benwicks being supposed to be an admirer of yours how charles could take such a thing into his head was always incomprehensible to me i hope he will be more agreeable now certainly not a great match for louisa musgrove but a million times better than marrying among the hayters mary need not have feared her sisters being in any degree prepared for the news she had never in her life been more astonished captain benwick and louisa musgrove it was almost too wonderful for belief and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain in the room preserve an air of calmness and answer the common questions of the moment happily for her they were not many sir walter wanted to know whether the crofts travelled with four horses and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of bath as it might suit miss elliot and himself to visit in but had little curiosity beyond how is mary said elizabeth and without waiting for an answer and pray what brings the crofts to bath they come on the admirals account he is thought to be gouty gout and decrepitude said sir walter poor old gentleman have they any acquaintance here asked elizabeth i do not know but i can hardly suppose that at admiral crofts time of life and in his profession he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this i suspect said sir walter coolly that admiral croft will be best known in bath as the renter of kellynch hall elizabeth may we venture to present him and his wife in laura place oh no i think not situated as we are with lady dalrymple cousins we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance she might not approve if we were not related it would not signify but as cousins she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours we had better leave the crofts to find their own level there are several odd-looking men walking about here who i am told are sailors the crofts will associate with them this was sir walter and elizabeths share of interest in the letter when mrs clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention in an enquiry after mrs charles musgrove and her fine little boys anne was at liberty in her own room she tried to comprehend it well might charles wonder how captain wentworth would feel perhaps he had quitted the field had given louisa up had ceased to love had found he did not love her she could not endure the idea of treachery or levity or anything akin to ill usage between him and his friend she could not endure that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly captain benwick and louisa musgrove the high-spirited joyous-talking louisa musgrove and the dejected thinking feeling reading captain benwick seemed each of them everything that would not suit the other their minds most dissimilar where could have been the attraction the answer soon presented itself it had been in situation they had been thrown together several weeks they had been living in the same small family party since henriettas coming away they must have been depending almost entirely on each other and louisa just recovering from illness had been in an interesting state and captain benwick was not inconsolable that was a point which anne had not been able to avoid suspecting before and instead of drawing the same conclusion as mary from the present course of events they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself she did not mean however to derive much more from it to gratify her vanity than mary might have allowed she was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have received the same compliment he had an affectionate heart he must love somebody
