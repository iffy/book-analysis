this child in order that your name might become extinct that is reasonable since he is an only son well now that all is arranged do not let these newly awakened remembrances be forgotten you have doubtless already guessed that i was preparing a surprise for you an agreeable one asked the italian ah i see the eye of a father is no more to be deceived than his heart hum said the major someone has told you the secret or perhaps you guessed that he was here that who was here your child your son your andrea i did guess it replied the major with the greatest possible coolness then he is here he is said monte cristo when the valet de chambre came in just now he told me of his arrival ah very well very well said the major clutching the buttons of his coat at each exclamation my dear sir said monte cristo i understand your emotion you must have time to recover yourself i will in the meantime go and prepare the young man for this much-desired interview for i presume that he is not less impatient for it than yourself i should quite imagine that to be the case said cavalcanti well in a quarter of an hour he shall be with you you will bring him then you carry your goodness so far as even to present him to me yourself no i do not wish to come between a father and son your interview will be private but do not be uneasy even if the powerful voice of nature should be silent you cannot well mistake him he will enter by this door he is a fine young man of fair complexion a little too fair perhaps pleasing in manners but you will see and judge for yourself by the way said the major you know i have only the francs which the abb busoni sent me this sum i have expended upon travelling expenses and and you want money that is a matter of course my dear m cavalcanti well here are francs on account the majors eyes sparkled brilliantly it is francs which i now owe you said monte cristo does your excellency wish for a receipt said the major at the same time slipping the money into the inner pocket of his coat for what said the count i thought you might want it to show the abb busoni well when you receive the remaining you shall give me a receipt in full between honest men such excessive precaution is i think quite unnecessary yes so it is between perfectly upright people one word more said monte cristo say on you will permit me to make one remark certainly pray do so then i should advise you to leave off wearing that style of dress indeed said the major regarding himself with an air of complete satisfaction yes it may be worn at via reggio but that costume however elegant in itself has long been out of fashion in paris thats unfortunate oh if you really are attached to your old mode of dress you can easily resume it when you leave paris but what shall i wear what you find in your trunks in my trunks i have but one portmanteau i dare say you have nothing else with you what is the use of boring ones self with so many things besides an old soldier always likes to march with as little baggage as possible that is just the case precisely so but you are a man of foresight and prudence therefore you sent your luggage on before you it has arrived at the htel des princes rue de richelieu it is there you are to take up your quarters then in these trunks i presume you have given orders to your valet de chambre to put in all you are likely to need your plain clothes and your uniform on grand occasions you must wear your uniform that will look very well do not forget your crosses they still laugh at them in france and yet always wear them for all that very well very well said the major who was in ecstasy at the attention paid him by the count now said monte cristo that you have fortified yourself against all painful excitement prepare yourself my dear m cavalcanti to meet your lost andrea saying which monte cristo bowed and disappeared behind the tapestry leaving the major fascinated beyond expression with the delightful reception which he had received at the hands of the count chapter andrea cavalcanti the count of monte cristo entered the adjoining room which baptistin had designated as the drawing-room and found there a young man of graceful demeanor and elegant appearance who had arrived in a cab about half an hour previously baptistin had not found any difficulty in recognizing the person who presented himself at the door for admittance he was certainly the tall young man with light hair red beard black eyes and brilliant complexion whom his master had so particularly described to him when the count entered the room the young man was carelessly stretched on a sofa tapping his boot with the gold-headed cane which he held in his hand on perceiving the count he rose quickly the count of monte cristo i believe said he yes sir and
