was dressed to go out her bonnet was placed beside her on a chair and her gloves were on her hands ah here you are monsieur she said in her naturally calm voice but how pale you are have you been working all night why did you not come down to breakfast well will you take me or shall i take edward madame de villefort had multiplied her questions in order to gain one answer but to all her inquiries m de villefort remained mute and cold as a statue edward said villefort fixing an imperious glance on the child go and play in the drawing-room my dear i wish to speak to your mamma madame de villefort shuddered at the sight of that cold countenance that resolute tone and the awfully strange preliminaries edward raised his head looked at his mother and then finding that she did not confirm the order began cutting off the heads of his leaden soldiers edward cried m de villefort so harshly that the child started up from the floor do you hear me go the child unaccustomed to such treatment arose pale and trembling it would be difficult to say whether his emotion were caused by fear or passion his father went up to him took him in his arms and kissed his forehead go he said go my child edward ran out m de villefort went to the door which he closed behind the child and bolted dear me said the young woman endeavoring to read her husbands inmost thoughts while a smile passed over her countenance which froze the impassibility of villefort what is the matter madame where do you keep the poison you generally use said the magistrate without any introduction placing himself between his wife and the door madame de villefort must have experienced something of the sensation of a bird which looking up sees the murderous trap closing over its head a hoarse broken tone which was neither a cry nor a sigh escaped from her while she became deadly pale monsieur she said i i do not understand you and in her first paroxysm of terror she had raised herself from the sofa in the next stronger very likely than the other she fell down again on the cushions i asked you continued villefort in a perfectly calm tone where you conceal the poison by the aid of which you have killed my father-in-law m de saint-mran my mother-in-law madame de saint-mran barrois and my daughter valentine ah sir exclaimed madame de villefort clasping her hands what do you say it is not for you to interrogate but to answer is it to the judge or to the husband stammered madame de villefort to the judge to the judge madame it was terrible to behold the frightful pallor of that woman the anguish of her look the trembling of her whole frame ah sir she muttered ah sir and this was all you do not answer madame exclaimed the terrible interrogator then he added with a smile yet more terrible than his anger it is true then you do not deny it she moved forward and you cannot deny it added villefort extending his hand toward her as though to seize her in the name of justice you have accomplished these different crimes with impudent address but which could only deceive those whose affections for you blinded them since the death of madame de saint-mran i have known that a poisoner lived in my house m davrigny warned me of it after the death of barrois my suspicions were directed towards an angel those suspicions which even when there is no crime are always alive in my heart but after the death of valentine there has been no doubt in my mind madame and not only in mine but in those of others thus your crime known by two persons suspected by many will soon become public and as i told you just now you no longer speak to the husband but to the judge m the young woman hid her face in her hands oh sir she stammered i beseech you do not believe appearances are you then a coward cried villefort in a contemptuous voice but i have always observed that poisoners were cowards can you be a coward you who have had the courage to witness the death of two old men and a young girl murdered by you sir sir can you be a coward continued villefort with increasing excitement you who could count one by one the minutes of four death agonies you who have arranged your infernal plans and removed the beverages with a talent and precision almost miraculous have you then who have calculated everything with such nicety have you forgotten to calculate one thing i mean where the revelation of your crimes will lead you to oh it is impossible you must have saved some surer more subtle and deadly poison than any other that you might escape the punishment that you deserve you have done this i hope so at least madame de villefort stretched out her hands and fell on her knees i understand he said you confess but a confession made to the judges a confession made at the last moment extorted when the crime cannot be denied diminishes not the punishment inflicted on the guilty the punishment
