view of supporting her hopes and raising her spirits in general his voice and manner were studiously calm to spare henrietta from agitation seemed the governing principle once only when she had been grieving over the last ill-judged ill-fated walk to the cobb bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of he burst forth as if wholly overcome dont talk of it dont talk of it he cried oh god that i had not given way to her at the fatal moment had i done as i ought but so eager and so resolute dear sweet louisa anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now to question the justness of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage of firmness of character and whether it might not strike him that like all other qualities of the mind it should have its proportions and limits she thought it could scarcely escape him to feel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness as a very resolute character they got on fast anne was astonished to recognise the same hills and the same objects so soon their actual speed heightened by some dread of the conclusion made the road appear but half as long as on the day before it was growing quite dusk however before they were in the neighbourhood of uppercross and there had been total silence among them for some time henrietta leaning back in the corner with a shawl over her face giving the hope of her having cried herself to sleep when as they were going up their last hill anne found herself all at once addressed by captain wentworth in a low cautious voice he said i have been considering what we had best do she must not appear at first she could not stand it i have been thinking whether you had not better remain in the carriage with her while i go in and break it to mr and mrs musgrove do you think this is a good plan she did he was satisfied and said no more but the remembrance of the appeal remained a pleasure to her as a proof of friendship and of deference for her judgement a great pleasure and when it became a sort of parting proof its value did not lessen when the distressing communication at uppercross was over and he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped and the daughter all the better for being with them he announced his intention of returning in the same carriage to lyme and when the horses were baited he was off end of volume one chapter the remainder of annes time at uppercross comprehending only two days was spent entirely at the mansion house and she had the satisfaction of knowing herself extremely useful there both as an immediate companion and as assisting in all those arrangements for the future which in mr and mrs musgroves distressed state of spirits would have been difficulties they had an early account from lyme the next morning louisa was much the same no symptoms worse than before had appeared charles came a few hours afterwards to bring a later and more particular account he was tolerably cheerful a speedy cure must not be hoped but everything was going on as well as the nature of the case admitted in speaking of the harvilles he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness especially of mrs harvilles exertions as a nurse she really left nothing for mary to do he and mary had been persuaded to go early to their inn last night mary had been hysterical again this morning when he came away she was going to walk out with captain benwick which he hoped would do her good he almost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before but the truth was that mrs harville left nothing for anybody to do charles was to return to lyme the same afternoon and his father had at first half a mind to go with him but the ladies could not consent it would be going only to multiply trouble to the others and increase his own distress and a much better scheme followed and was acted upon a chaise was sent for from crewkherne and charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery-maid of the family one who having brought up all the children and seen the very last the lingering and long-petted master harry sent to school after his brothers was now living in her deserted nursery to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could get near her and who consequently was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurse dear miss louisa vague wishes of getting sarah thither had occurred before to mrs musgrove and henrietta but without anne it would hardly have been resolved on and found practicable so soon they were indebted the next day to charles hayter for all the minute knowledge of louisa which it was so essential to obtain every twenty-four hours he made it his business to go to lyme and his account was still encouraging the intervals of sense and consciousness were believed to be stronger every report agreed in captain wentworths appearing fixed
