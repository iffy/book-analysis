do in order that they may see in the resplendent night of their own imagination more stars than are visible in the firmament then he re-opened them and stood motionless with amazement three compartments divided the coffer in the first blazed piles of golden coin in the second were ranged bars of unpolished gold which possessed nothing attractive save their value in the third edmond grasped handfuls of diamonds pearls and rubies which as they fell on one another sounded like hail against glass after having touched felt examined these treasures edmond rushed through the caverns like a man seized with frenzy he leaped on a rock from whence he could behold the sea he was alone alone with these countless these unheard-of treasures was he awake or was it but a dream was it a transient vision or was he face to face with reality he would fain have gazed upon his gold and yet he had not strength enough for an instant he leaned his head in his hands as if to prevent his senses from leaving him and then rushed madly about the rocks of monte cristo terrifying the wild goats and scaring the sea-fowls with his wild cries and gestures then he returned and still unable to believe the evidence of his senses rushed into the grotto and found himself before this mine of gold and jewels this time he fell on his knees and clasping his hands convulsively uttered a prayer intelligible to god alone he soon became calmer and more happy for only now did he begin to realize his felicity he then set himself to work to count his fortune there were a thousand ingots of gold each weighing from two to three pounds then he piled up twenty-five thousand crowns each worth about eighty francs of our money and bearing the effigies of alexander vi and his predecessors and he saw that the complement was not half empty and he measured ten double handfuls of pearls diamonds and other gems many of which mounted by the most famous workmen were valuable beyond their intrinsic worth dants saw the light gradually disappear and fearing to be surprised in the cavern left it his gun in his hand a piece of biscuit and a small quantity of rum formed his supper and he snatched a few hours sleep lying over the mouth of the cave it was a night of joy and terror such as this man of stupendous emotions had already experienced twice or thrice in his lifetime chapter the unknown day for which dants had so eagerly and impatiently waited with open eyes again dawned with the first light dants resumed his search again he climbed the rocky height he had ascended the previous evening and strained his view to catch every peculiarity of the landscape but it wore the same wild barren aspect when seen by the rays of the morning sun which it had done when surveyed by the fading glimmer of eve descending into the grotto he lifted the stone filled his pockets with gems put the box together as well and securely as he could sprinkled fresh sand over the spot from which it had been taken and then carefully trod down the earth to give it everywhere a uniform appearance then quitting the grotto he replaced the stone heaping on it broken masses of rocks and rough fragments of crumbling granite filling the interstices with earth into which he deftly inserted rapidly growing plants such as the wild myrtle and flowering thorn then carefully watering these new plantations he scrupulously effaced every trace of footsteps leaving the approach to the cavern as savage-looking and untrodden as he had found it this done he impatiently awaited the return of his companions to wait at monte cristo for the purpose of watching like a dragon over the almost incalculable riches that had thus fallen into his possession satisfied not the cravings of his heart which yearned to return to dwell among mankind and to assume the rank power and influence which are always accorded to wealth that first and greatest of all the forces within the grasp of man on the sixth day the smugglers returned from a distance dants recognized the rig and handling of la jeune amlie and dragging himself with affected difficulty towards the landing-place he met his companions with an assurance that although considerably better than when they quitted him he still suffered acutely from his late accident he then inquired how they had fared in their trip to this question the smugglers replied that although successful in landing their cargo in safety they had scarcely done so when they received intelligence that a guard-ship had just quitted the port of toulon and was crowding all sail towards them this obliged them to make all the speed they could to evade the enemy when they could but lament the absence of dants whose superior skill in the management of a vessel would have availed them so materially in fact the pursuing vessel had almost overtaken them when fortunately night came on and enabled them to double the cape of corsica and so elude all further pursuit upon the whole however the trip had been sufficiently successful to satisfy all concerned while the crew and particularly jacopo expressed great regrets that dants had not been an equal sharer
