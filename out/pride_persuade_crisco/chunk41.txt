an attachment and nothing to prevent it am i wrong my dearest jane in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many what do you think of this sentence my dear lizzy said jane as she finished it is it not clear enough does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she is perfectly convinced of her brothers indifference and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly to put me on my guard can there be any other opinion on the subject yes there can for mine is totally different will you hear it most willingly you shall have it in a few words miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy she follows him to town in hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you jane shook her head indeed jane you ought to believe me no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection miss bingley i am sure cannot she is not such a simpleton could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes but the case is this we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane your representation of all this might make me quite easy but i know the foundation is unjust caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceiving herself that is right you could not have started a more happy idea since you will not take comfort in mine believe her to be deceived by all means you have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer but my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere you must decide for yourself said elizabeth and if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by all means to refuse him how can you talk so said jane faintly smiling you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could not hesitate i did not think you would and that being the case i cannot consider your situation with much compassion but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required a thousand things may arise in six months the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt it appeared to her merely the suggestion of carolines interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect janes temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart they agreed that mrs bennet should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentlemans conduct but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together after lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation that mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses chapter the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr collins elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her it keeps him in good humour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time this was very amiable but charlottes kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of its object
