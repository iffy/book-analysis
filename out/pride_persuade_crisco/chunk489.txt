in his turn looking around to see what lucien was doing really said monte cristo lowering his voice you do not appear to me to be very enthusiastic on the subject of this marriage mademoiselle danglars is too rich for me replied morcerf and that frightens me bah exclaimed monte cristo thats a fine reason to give are you not rich yourself my fathers income is about francs per annum and he will give me perhaps ten or twelve thousand when i marry that perhaps might not be considered a large sum in paris especially said the count but everything does not depend on wealth and it is a fine thing to have a good name and to occupy a high station in society your name is celebrated your position magnificent and then the comte de morcerf is a soldier and it is pleasing to see the integrity of a bayard united to the poverty of a duguesclin disinterestedness is the brightest ray in which a noble sword can shine as for me i consider the union with mademoiselle danglars a most suitable one she will enrich you and you will ennoble her albert shook his head and looked thoughtful there is still something else said he i confess observed monte cristo that i have some difficulty in comprehending your objection to a young lady who is both rich and beautiful oh said morcerf this repugnance if repugnance it may be called is not all on my side whence can it arise then for you told me your father desired the marriage it is my mother who dissents she has a clear and penetrating judgment and does not smile on the proposed union i cannot account for it but she seems to entertain some prejudice against the danglars m ah said the count in a somewhat forced tone that may be easily explained the comtesse de morcerf who is aristocracy and refinement itself does not relish the idea of being allied by your marriage with one of ignoble birth that is natural enough i do not know if that is her reason said albert but one thing i do know that if this marriage be consummated it will render her quite miserable there was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in order to talk over and settle the affair but i had such a sudden attack of indisposition real interrupted the count smiling oh real enough from anxiety doubtless at any rate they postponed the matter for two months there is no hurry you know i am not yet twenty-one and eugnie is only seventeen but the two months expire next week it must be done my dear count you cannot imagine how my mind is harassed how happy you are in being exempt from all this well and why should not you be free too what prevents you from being so oh it will be too great a disappointment to my father if i do not marry mademoiselle danglars marry her then said the count with a significant shrug of the shoulders yes replied morcerf but that will plunge my mother into positive grief then do not marry her said the count well i shall see i will try and think over what is the best thing to be done you will give me your advice will you not and if possible extricate me from my unpleasant position i think rather than give pain to my dear mother i would run the risk of offending the count monte cristo turned away he seemed moved by this last remark ah said he to debray who had thrown himself into an easy-chair at the farthest extremity of the salon and who held a pencil in his right hand and an account book in his left what are you doing there are you making a sketch after poussin oh no was the tranquil response i am too fond of art to attempt anything of that sort i am doing a little sum in arithmetic in arithmetic yes i am calculating by the way morcerf that indirectly concerns you i am calculating what the house of danglars must have gained by the last rise in haiti bonds from they have risen to in three days and the prudent banker had purchased at therefore he must have made livres that is not his biggest scoop said morcerf did he not make a million in spaniards this last year my dear fellow said lucien here is the count of monte cristo who will say to you as the italians do denaro e santit met della met when they tell me such things i only shrug my shoulders and say nothing but you were speaking of haitians said monte cristo ah haitians that is quite another thing haitians are the cart of french stock-jobbing we may like bouillotte delight in whist be enraptured with boston and yet grow tired of them all but we always come back to cart it is not only a game it is a hors-duvre m danglars sold yesterday at and pockets francs had he but waited till today the price would have fallen to and instead of gaining francs he would have lost or and what has caused the sudden fall from to asked monte cristo i am profoundly ignorant of all these stock-jobbing intrigues because said albert laughing one piece
