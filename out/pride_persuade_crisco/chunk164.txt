probably never heard and never thought of any claims of charles hayter he was only wrong in accepting the attentions for accepting must be the word of two young women at once after a short struggle however charles hayter seemed to quit the field three days had passed without his coming once to uppercross a most decided change he had even refused one regular invitation to dinner and having been found on the occasion by mr musgrove with some large books before him mr and mrs musgrove were sure all could not be right and talked with grave faces of his studying himself to death it was marys hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal from henrietta and her husband lived under the constant dependence of seeing him to-morrow anne could only feel that charles hayter was wise one morning about this time charles musgrove and captain wentworth being gone a-shooting together as the sisters in the cottage were sitting quietly at work they were visited at the window by the sisters from the mansion-house it was a very fine november day and the miss musgroves came through the little grounds and stopped for no other purpose than to say that they were going to take a long walk and therefore concluded mary could not like to go with them and when mary immediately replied with some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker oh yes i should like to join you very much i am very fond of a long walk anne felt persuaded by the looks of the two girls that it was precisely what they did not wish and admired again the sort of necessity which the family habits seemed to produce of everything being to be communicated and everything being to be done together however undesired and inconvenient she tried to dissuade mary from going but in vain and that being the case thought it best to accept the miss musgroves much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise as she might be useful in turning back with her sister and lessening the interference in any plan of their own i cannot imagine why they should suppose i should not like a long walk said mary as she went up stairs everybody is always supposing that i am not a good walker and yet they would not have been pleased if we had refused to join them when people come in this manner on purpose to ask us how can one say no just as they were setting off the gentlemen returned they had taken out a young dog who had spoilt their sport and sent them back early their time and strength and spirits were therefore exactly ready for this walk and they entered into it with pleasure could anne have foreseen such a junction she would have staid at home but from some feelings of interest and curiosity she fancied now that it was too late to retract and the whole six set forward together in the direction chosen by the miss musgroves who evidently considered the walk as under their guidance annes object was not to be in the way of anybody and where the narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary to keep with her brother and sister her pleasure in the walk must arise from the exercise and the day from the view of the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves and withered hedges and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical descriptions extant of autumn that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness that season which had drawn from every poet worthy of being read some attempt at description or some lines of feeling she occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings and quotations but it was not possible that when within reach of captain wentworths conversation with either of the miss musgroves she should not try to hear it yet she caught little very remarkable it was mere lively chat such as any young persons on an intimate footing might fall into he was more engaged with louisa than with henrietta louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister this distinction appeared to increase and there was one speech of louisas which struck her after one of the many praises of the day which were continually bursting forth captain wentworth added what glorious weather for the admiral and my sister they meant to take a long drive this morning perhaps we may hail them from some of these hills they talked of coming into this side of the country i wonder whereabouts they will upset to-day oh it does happen very often i assure you but my sister makes nothing of it she would as lieve be tossed out as not ah you make the most of it i know cried louisa but if it were really so i should do just the same in her place if i loved a man as she loves the admiral i would always be with him nothing should ever separate us and i would rather be overturned by him than driven safely by anybody else it was spoken with enthusiasm had you cried he catching the same tone i honour you and there was silence between them for
