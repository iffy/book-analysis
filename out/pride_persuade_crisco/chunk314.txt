re-passed his island of monte cristo twenty times but not once had he found an opportunity of landing there he then formed a resolution as soon as his engagement with the patron of la jeune amlie ended he would hire a small vessel on his own account for in his several voyages he had amassed a hundred piastres and under some pretext land at the island of monte cristo then he would be free to make his researches not perhaps entirely at liberty for he would be doubtless watched by those who accompanied him but in this world we must risk something prison had made edmond prudent and he was desirous of running no risk whatever but in vain did he rack his imagination fertile as it was he could not devise any plan for reaching the island without companionship dants was tossed about on these doubts and wishes when the patron who had great confidence in him and was very desirous of retaining him in his service took him by the arm one evening and led him to a tavern on the via del oglio where the leading smugglers of leghorn used to congregate and discuss affairs connected with their trade already dants had visited this maritime bourse two or three times and seeing all these hardy free-traders who supplied the whole coast for nearly two hundred leagues in extent he had asked himself what power might not that man attain who should give the impulse of his will to all these contrary and diverging minds this time it was a great matter that was under discussion connected with a vessel laden with turkey carpets stuffs of the levant and cashmeres it was necessary to find some neutral ground on which an exchange could be made and then to try and land these goods on the coast of france if the venture was successful the profit would be enormous there would be a gain of fifty or sixty piastres each for the crew the patron of la jeune amlie proposed as a place of landing the island of monte cristo which being completely deserted and having neither soldiers nor revenue officers seemed to have been placed in the midst of the ocean since the time of the heathen olympus by mercury the god of merchants and robbers classes of mankind which we in modern times have separated if not made distinct but which antiquity appears to have included in the same category at the mention of monte cristo dants started with joy he rose to conceal his emotion and took a turn around the smoky tavern where all the languages of the known world were jumbled in a lingua franca when he again joined the two persons who had been discussing the matter it had been decided that they should touch at monte cristo and set out on the following night edmond being consulted was of opinion that the island afforded every possible security and that great enterprises to be well done should be done quickly nothing then was altered in the plan and orders were given to get under weigh next night and wind and weather permitting to make the neutral island by the following day m chapter the island of monte cristo thus at length by one of the unexpected strokes of fortune which sometimes befall those who have for a long time been the victims of an evil destiny dants was about to secure the opportunity he wished for by simple and natural means and land on the island without incurring any suspicion one night more and he would be on his way the night was one of feverish distraction and in its progress visions good and evil passed through dants mind if he closed his eyes he saw cardinal spadas letter written on the wall in characters of flame if he slept for a moment the wildest dreams haunted his brain he ascended into grottos paved with emeralds with panels of rubies and the roof glowing with diamond stalactites pearls fell drop by drop as subterranean waters filter in their caves edmond amazed wonderstruck filled his pockets with the radiant gems and then returned to daylight when he discovered that his prizes had all changed into common pebbles he then endeavored to re-enter the marvellous grottos but they had suddenly receded and now the path became a labyrinth and then the entrance vanished and in vain did he tax his memory for the magic and mysterious word which opened the splendid caverns of ali baba to the arabian fisherman all was useless the treasure disappeared and had again reverted to the genii from whom for a moment he had hoped to carry it off the day came at length and was almost as feverish as the night had been but it brought reason to the aid of imagination and dants was then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and unsettled in his brain night came and with it the preparation for departure and these preparations served to conceal dants agitation he had by degrees assumed such authority over his companions that he was almost like a commander on board and as his orders were always clear distinct and easy of execution his comrades obeyed him with celerity and pleasure the old patron did not interfere for he too had recognized the superiority of
