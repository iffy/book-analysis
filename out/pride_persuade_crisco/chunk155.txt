and tell charles and get ready directly you can send for us you know at a moments notice if anything is the matter but i dare say there will be nothing to alarm you i should not go you may be sure if i did not feel quite at ease about my dear child the next moment she was tapping at her husbands dressing-room door and as anne followed her up stairs she was in time for the whole conversation which began with marys saying in a tone of great exultation i mean to go with you charles for i am of no more use at home than you are if i were to shut myself up for ever with the child i should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like anne will stay anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him it is annes own proposal and so i shall go with you which will be a great deal better for i have not dined at the other house since tuesday this is very kind of anne was her husbands answer and i should be very glad to have you go but it seems rather hard that she should be left at home by herself to nurse our sick child anne was now at hand to take up her own cause and the sincerity of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him where conviction was at least very agreeable he had no farther scruples as to her being left to dine alone though he still wanted her to join them in the evening when the child might be at rest for the night and kindly urged her to let him come and fetch her but she was quite unpersuadable and this being the case she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set off together in high spirits they were gone she hoped to be happy however oddly constructed such happiness might seem as for herself she was left with as many sensations of comfort as were perhaps ever likely to be hers she knew herself to be of the first utility to the child and what was it to her if frederick wentworth were only half a mile distant making himself agreeable to others she would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting perhaps indifferent if indifference could exist under such circumstances he must be either indifferent or unwilling had he wished ever to see her again he need not have waited till this time he would have done what she could not but believe that in his place she should have done long ago when events had been early giving him the independence which alone had been wanting her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance and their visit in general there had been music singing talking laughing all that was most agreeable charming manners in captain wentworth no shyness or reserve they seemed all to know each other perfectly and he was coming the very next morning to shoot with charles he was to come to breakfast but not at the cottage though that had been proposed at first but then he had been pressed to come to the great house instead and he seemed afraid of being in mrs charles musgroves way on account of the child and therefore somehow they hardly knew how it ended in charless being to meet him to breakfast at his fathers anne understood it he wished to avoid seeing her he had inquired after her she found slightly as might suit a former slight acquaintance seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged actuated perhaps by the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet the morning hours of the cottage were always later than those of the other house and on the morrow the difference was so great that mary and anne were not more than beginning breakfast when charles came in to say that they were just setting off that he was come for his dogs that his sisters were following with captain wentworth his sisters meaning to visit mary and the child and captain wentworth proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient and though charles had answered for the childs being in no such state as could make it inconvenient captain wentworth would not be satisfied without his running on to give notice mary very much gratified by this attention was delighted to receive him while a thousand feelings rushed on anne of which this was the most consoling that it would soon be over and it was soon over in two minutes after charless preparation the others appeared they were in the drawing-room her eye half met captain wentworths a bow a curtsey passed she heard his voice he talked to mary said all that was right said something to the miss musgroves enough to mark an easy footing the room seemed full full of persons and voices but a few minutes ended it charles shewed himself at the window all was ready their visitor had bowed and was gone the miss musgroves were gone too suddenly resolving to walk to the end of the village with the sportsmen the room was cleared and anne might finish her breakfast as she
