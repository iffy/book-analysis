of the two friends but the admiral interrupted her with and the thing is certainly true it is not a mere bit of gossip we have it from frederick himself his sister had a letter from him yesterday in which he tells us of it and he had just had it in a letter from harville written upon the spot from uppercross i fancy they are all at uppercross this was an opportunity which anne could not resist she said therefore i hope admiral i hope there is nothing in the style of captain wentworths letter to make you and mrs croft particularly uneasy it did seem last autumn as if there were an attachment between him and louisa musgrove but i hope it may be understood to have worn out on each side equally and without violence i hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill-used man not at all not at all there is not an oath or a murmur from beginning to end anne looked down to hide her smile no no frederick is not a man to whine and complain he has too much spirit for that if the girl likes another man better it is very fit she should have him certainly but what i mean is that i hope there is nothing in captain wentworths manner of writing to make you suppose he thinks himself ill-used by his friend which might appear you know without its being absolutely said i should be very sorry that such a friendship as has subsisted between him and captain benwick should be destroyed or even wounded by a circumstance of this sort yes yes i understand you but there is nothing at all of that nature in the letter he does not give the least fling at benwick does not so much as say i wonder at it i have a reason of my own for wondering at it no you would not guess from his way of writing that he had ever thought of this miss whats her name for himself he very handsomely hopes they will be happy together and there is nothing very unforgiving in that i think anne did not receive the perfect conviction which the admiral meant to convey but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther she therefore satisfied herself with common-place remarks or quiet attention and the admiral had it all his own way poor frederick said he at last now he must begin all over again with somebody else i think we must get him to bath sophy must write and beg him to come to bath here are pretty girls enough i am sure it would be of no use to go to uppercross again for that other miss musgrove i find is bespoke by her cousin the young parson do not you think miss elliot we had better try to get him to bath chapter while admiral croft was taking this walk with anne and expressing his wish of getting captain wentworth to bath captain wentworth was already on his way thither before mrs croft had written he was arrived and the very next time anne walked out she saw him mr elliot was attending his two cousins and mrs clay they were in milsom street it began to rain not much but enough to make shelter desirable for women and quite enough to make it very desirable for miss elliot to have the advantage of being conveyed home in lady dalrymples carriage which was seen waiting at a little distance she anne and mrs clay therefore turned into mollands while mr elliot stepped to lady dalrymple to request her assistance he soon joined them again successful of course lady dalrymple would be most happy to take them home and would call for them in a few minutes her ladyships carriage was a barouche and did not hold more than four with any comfort miss carteret was with her mother consequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation for all the three camden place ladies there could be no doubt as to miss elliot whoever suffered inconvenience she must suffer none but it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility between the other two the rain was a mere trifle and anne was most sincere in preferring a walk with mr elliot but the rain was also a mere trifle to mrs clay she would hardly allow it even to drop at all and her boots were so thick much thicker than miss annes and in short her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left to walk with mr elliot as anne could be and it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and so determined that the others were obliged to settle it for them miss elliot maintaining that mrs clay had a little cold already and mr elliot deciding on appeal that his cousin annes boots were rather the thickest it was fixed accordingly that mrs clay should be of the party in the carriage and they had just reached this point when anne as she sat near the window descried most decidedly and distinctly captain wentworth walking down the street her start was perceptible only to herself but she instantly felt that she was the greatest simpleton in the world the most unaccountable and
