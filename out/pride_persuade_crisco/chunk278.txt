mark the lapse of time dants said i wish to die and had chosen the manner of his death and fearful of changing his mind he had taken an oath to die when my morning and evening meals are brought thought he i will cast them out of the window and they will think that i have eaten them he kept his word twice a day he cast out through the barred aperture the provisions his jailer brought him at first gayly then with deliberation and at last with regret nothing but the recollection of his oath gave him strength to proceed hunger made viands once repugnant now acceptable he held the plate in his hand for an hour at a time and gazed thoughtfully at the morsel of bad meat of tainted fish of black and mouldy bread it was the last yearning for life contending with the resolution of despair then his dungeon seemed less sombre his prospects less desperate he was still young he was only four or five-and-twenty he had nearly fifty years to live what unforseen events might not open his prison door and restore him to liberty then he raised to his lips the repast that like a voluntary tantalus he refused himself but he thought of his oath and he would not break it he persisted until at last he had not sufficient strength to rise and cast his supper out of the loophole the next morning he could not see or hear the jailer feared he was dangerously ill edmond hoped he was dying thus the day passed away edmond felt a sort of stupor creeping over him which brought with it a feeling almost of content the gnawing pain at his stomach had ceased his thirst had abated when he closed his eyes he saw myriads of lights dancing before them like the will-o-the-wisps that play about the marshes it was the twilight of that mysterious country called death suddenly about nine oclock in the evening edmond heard a hollow sound in the wall against which he was lying so many loathsome animals inhabited the prison that their noise did not in general awake him but whether abstinence had quickened his faculties or whether the noise was really louder than usual edmond raised his head and listened it was a continual scratching as if made by a huge claw a powerful tooth or some iron instrument attacking the stones although weakened the young mans brain instantly responded to the idea that haunts all prisoners liberty it seemed to him that heaven had at length taken pity on him and had sent this noise to warn him on the very brink of the abyss perhaps one of those beloved ones he had so often thought of was thinking of him and striving to diminish the distance that separated them no no doubtless he was deceived and it was but one of those dreams that forerun death edmond still heard the sound it lasted nearly three hours he then heard a noise of something falling and all was silent some hours afterwards it began again nearer and more distinct edmond was intensely interested suddenly the jailer entered for a week since he had resolved to die and during the four days that he had been carrying out his purpose edmond had not spoken to the attendant had not answered him when he inquired what was the matter with him and turned his face to the wall when he looked too curiously at him but now the jailer might hear the noise and put an end to it and so destroy a ray of something like hope that soothed his last moments the jailer brought him his breakfast dants raised himself up and began to talk about everything about the bad quality of the food about the coldness of his dungeon grumbling and complaining in order to have an excuse for speaking louder and wearying the patience of his jailer who out of kindness of heart had brought broth and white bread for his prisoner fortunately he fancied that dants was delirious and placing the food on the rickety table he withdrew edmond listened and the sound became more and more distinct there can be no doubt about it thought he it is some prisoner who is striving to obtain his freedom oh if i were only there to help him suddenly another idea took possession of his mind so used to misfortune that it was scarcely capable of hope the idea that the noise was made by workmen the governor had ordered to repair the neighboring dungeon it was easy to ascertain this but how could he risk the question it was easy to call his jailers attention to the noise and watch his countenance as he listened but might he not by this means destroy hopes far more important than the short-lived satisfaction of his own curiosity unfortunately edmonds brain was still so feeble that he could not bend his thoughts to anything in particular he saw but one means of restoring lucidity and clearness to his judgment he turned his eyes towards the soup which the jailer had brought rose staggered towards it raised the vessel to his lips and drank off the contents with a feeling of indescribable pleasure he had the resolution to stop with this he had often heard that
