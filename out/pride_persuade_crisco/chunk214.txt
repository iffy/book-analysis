added only five-and-twenty miles from uppercross and in a very fine country fine part of dorsetshire in the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom surrounded by three great proprietors each more careful and jealous than the other and to two of the three at least charles hayter might get a special recommendation not that he will value it as he ought he observed charles is too cool about sporting thats the worst of him i am extremely glad indeed cried anne particularly glad that this should happen and that of two sisters who both deserve equally well and who have always been such good friends the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other--that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort i hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both oh yes my father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer but he has no other fault to find money you know coming down with money--two daughters at once--it cannot be a very agreeable operation and it streightens him as to many things however i do not mean to say they have not a right to it it is very fit they should have daughters shares and i am sure he has always been a very kind liberal father to me mary does not above half like henriettas match she never did you know but she does not do him justice nor think enough about winthrop i cannot make her attend to the value of the property it is a very fair match as times go and i have liked charles hayter all my life and i shall not leave off now such excellent parents as mr and mrs musgrove exclaimed anne should be happy in their childrens marriages they do everything to confer happiness i am sure what a blessing to young people to be in such hands your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery both in young and old i hope you think louisa perfectly recovered now he answered rather hesitatingly yes i believe i do very much recovered but she is altered there is no running or jumping about no laughing or dancing it is quite different if one happens only to shut the door a little hard she starts and wriggles like a young dab-chick in the water and benwick sits at her elbow reading verses or whispering to her all day long anne could not help laughing that cannot be much to your taste i know said she but i do believe him to be an excellent young man to be sure he is nobody doubts it and i hope you do not think i am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and pleasures as myself i have a great value for benwick and when one can but get him to talk he has plenty to say his reading has done him no harm for he has fought as well as read he is a brave fellow i got more acquainted with him last monday than ever i did before we had a famous set-to at rat-hunting all the morning in my fathers great barns and he played his part so well that i have liked him the better ever since here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of charless following the others to admire mirrors and china but anne had heard enough to understand the present state of uppercross and rejoice in its happiness and though she sighed as she rejoiced her sigh had none of the ill-will of envy in it she would certainly have risen to their blessings if she could but she did not want to lessen theirs the visit passed off altogether in high good humour mary was in excellent spirits enjoying the gaiety and the change and so well satisfied with the journey in her mother-in-laws carriage with four horses and with her own complete independence of camden place that she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought and enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house as they were detailed to her she had no demands on her father or sister and her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome drawing-rooms elizabeth was for a short time suffering a good deal she felt that mrs musgrove and all her party ought to be asked to dine with them but she could not bear to have the difference of style the reduction of servants which a dinner must betray witnessed by those who had been always so inferior to the elliots of kellynch it was a struggle between propriety and vanity but vanity got the better and then elizabeth was happy again these were her internal persuasions old fashioned notions country hospitality we do not profess to give dinners few people in bath do lady alicia never does did not even ask her own sisters family though they were here a month and i dare say it would be very inconvenient to mrs musgrove put her quite out of her way i am sure she would rather not come she cannot feel easy with us i will ask them all for an evening that will
