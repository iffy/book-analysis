he passed but seemed filled with dear and cherished memories and thus he proceeded onwards till he arrived at the end of the rue de noailles from whence a full view of the alles de meilhan was obtained at this spot so pregnant with fond and filial remembrances his heart beat almost to bursting his knees tottered under him a mist floated over his sight and had he not clung for support to one of the trees he would inevitably have fallen to the ground and been crushed beneath the many vehicles continually passing there recovering himself however he wiped the perspiration from his brows and stopped not again till he found himself at the door of the house in which his father had lived the nasturtiums and other plants which his father had delighted to train before his window had all disappeared from the upper part of the house leaning against the tree he gazed thoughtfully for a time at the upper stories of the shabby little house then he advanced to the door and asked whether there were any rooms to be let though answered in the negative he begged so earnestly to be permitted to visit those on the fifth floor that in despite of the oft-repeated assurance of the concierge that they were occupied dants succeeded in inducing the man to go up to the tenants and ask permission for a gentleman to be allowed to look at them the tenants of the humble lodging were a young couple who had been scarcely married a week and seeing them dants sighed heavily nothing in the two small chambers forming the apartments remained as it had been in the time of the elder dants the very paper was different while the articles of antiquated furniture with which the rooms had been filled in edmonds time had all disappeared the four walls alone remained as he had left them the bed belonging to the present occupants was placed as the former owner of the chamber had been accustomed to have his and in spite of his efforts to prevent it the eyes of edmond were suffused in tears as he reflected that on that spot the old man had breathed his last vainly calling for his son the young couple gazed with astonishment at the sight of their visitors emotion and wondered to see the large tears silently chasing each other down his otherwise stern and immovable features but they felt the sacredness of his grief and kindly refrained from questioning him as to its cause while with instinctive delicacy they left him to indulge his sorrow alone m when he withdrew from the scene of his painful recollections they both accompanied him downstairs reiterating their hope that he would come again whenever he pleased and assuring him that their poor dwelling would ever be open to him as edmond passed the door on the fourth floor he paused to inquire whether caderousse the tailor still dwelt there but he received for reply that the person in question had got into difficulties and at the present time kept a small inn on the route from bellegarde to beaucaire having obtained the address of the person to whom the house in the alles de meilhan belonged dants next proceeded thither and under the name of lord wilmore the name and title inscribed on his passport purchased the small dwelling for the sum of twenty-five thousand francs at least ten thousand more than it was worth but had its owner asked half a million it would unhesitatingly have been given the very same day the occupants of the apartments on the fifth floor of the house now become the property of dants were duly informed by the notary who had arranged the necessary transfer of deeds etc that the new landlord gave them their choice of any of the rooms in the house without the least augmentation of rent upon condition of their giving instant possession of the two small chambers they at present inhabited this strange event aroused great wonder and curiosity in the neighborhood of the alles de meilhan and a multitude of theories were afloat none of which was anywhere near the truth but what raised public astonishment to a climax and set all conjecture at defiance was the knowledge that the same stranger who had in the morning visited the alles de meilhan had been seen in the evening walking in the little village of the catalans and afterwards observed to enter a poor fishermans hut and to pass more than an hour in inquiring after persons who had either been dead or gone away for more than fifteen or sixteen years but on the following day the family from whom all these particulars had been asked received a handsome present consisting of an entirely new fishing-boat with two seines and a tender the delighted recipients of these munificent gifts would gladly have poured out their thanks to their generous benefactor but they had seen him upon quitting the hut merely give some orders to a sailor and then springing lightly on horseback leave marseilles by the porte daix chapter the pont du gard inn such of my readers as have made a pedestrian excursion to the south of
