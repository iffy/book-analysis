just entering into life valentine the daughter by my first wife mademoiselle rene de saint-mran and edward the boy whose life you have this day saved and what is your deduction from this compensation sir inquired monte cristo my deduction is replied villefort that my father led away by his passions has committed some fault unknown to human justice but marked by the justice of god that god desirous in his mercy to punish but one person has visited this justice on him alone monte cristo with a smile on his lips uttered in the depths of his soul a groan which would have made villefort fly had he but heard it adieu sir said the magistrate who had risen from his seat i leave you bearing a remembrance of you a remembrance of esteem which i hope will not be disagreeable to you when you know me better for i am not a man to bore my friends as you will learn besides you have made an eternal friend of madame de villefort the count bowed and contented himself with seeing villefort to the door of his cabinet the procureur being escorted to his carriage by two footmen who on a signal from their master followed him with every mark of attention when he had gone monte cristo breathed a profound sigh and said enough of this poison let me now seek the antidote then sounding his bell he said to ali who entered i am going to madames chamber have the carriage ready at one oclock chapter hayde it will be recollected that the new or rather old acquaintances of the count of monte cristo residing in the rue meslay were no other than maximilian julie and emmanuel the very anticipations of delight to be enjoyed in his forthcoming visits the bright pure gleam of heavenly happiness it diffused over the almost deadly warfare in which he had voluntarily engaged illumined his whole countenance with a look of ineffable joy and calmness as immediately after villeforts departure his thoughts flew back to the cheering prospect before him of tasting at least a brief respite from the fierce and stormy passions of his mind even ali who had hastened to obey the counts summons went forth from his masters presence in charmed amazement at the unusual animation and pleasure depicted on features ordinarily so stern and cold while as though dreading to put to flight the agreeable ideas hovering over his patrons meditations whatever they were the faithful nubian walked on tiptoe towards the door holding his breath lest its faintest sound should dissipate his masters happy reverie it was noon and monte cristo had set apart one hour to be passed in the apartments of hayde as though his oppressed spirit could not all at once admit the feeling of pure and unmixed joy but required a gradual succession of calm and gentle emotions to prepare his mind to receive full and perfect happiness in the same manner as ordinary natures demand to be inured by degrees to the reception of strong or violent sensations the young greek as we have already said occupied apartments wholly unconnected with those of the count the rooms had been fitted up in strict accordance with oriental ideas the floors were covered with the richest carpets turkey could produce the walls hung with brocaded silk of the most magnificent designs and texture while around each chamber luxurious divans were placed with piles of soft and yielding cushions that needed only to be arranged at the pleasure or convenience of such as sought repose hayde had three french maids and one who was a greek the first three remained constantly in a small waiting-room ready to obey the summons of a small golden bell or to receive the orders of the romaic slave who knew just enough french to be able to transmit her mistresss wishes to the three other waiting-women the latter had received most peremptory instructions from monte cristo to treat hayde with all the deference they would observe to a queen the young girl herself generally passed her time in the chamber at the farther end of her apartments this was a sort of boudoir circular and lighted only from the roof which consisted of rose-colored glass hayde was reclining upon soft downy cushions covered with blue satin spotted with silver her head supported by one of her exquisitely moulded arms rested on the divan immediately behind her while the other was employed in adjusting to her lips the coral tube of a rich narghile through whose flexible pipe she drew the smoke fragrant by its passage through perfumed water her attitude though perfectly natural for an eastern woman would in a european have been deemed too full of coquettish straining after effect her dress which was that of the women of epirus consisted of a pair of white satin trousers embroidered with pink roses displaying feet so exquisitely formed and so delicately fair that they might well have been taken for parian marble had not the eye been undeceived by their movements as they constantly shifted in and out of a pair of little slippers with upturned toes beautifully ornamented
