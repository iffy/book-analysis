in lyme anne was to leave them on the morrow an event which they all dreaded what should they do without her they were wretched comforters for one another and so much was said in this way that anne thought she could not do better than impart among them the general inclination to which she was privy and persuaded them all to go to lyme at once she had little difficulty it was soon determined that they would go go to-morrow fix themselves at the inn or get into lodgings as it suited and there remain till dear louisa could be moved they must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with they might at least relieve mrs harville from the care of her own children and in short they were so happy in the decision that anne was delighted with what she had done and felt that she could not spend her last morning at uppercross better than in assisting their preparations and sending them off at an early hour though her being left to the solitary range of the house was the consequence she was the last excepting the little boys at the cottage she was the very last the only remaining one of all that had filled and animated both houses of all that had given uppercross its cheerful character a few days had made a change indeed if louisa recovered it would all be well again more than former happiness would be restored there could not be a doubt to her mind there was none of what would follow her recovery a few months hence and the room now so deserted occupied but by her silent pensive self might be filled again with all that was happy and gay all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love all that was most unlike anne elliot an hour's complete leisure for such reflections as these on a dark november day a small thick rain almost blotting out the very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows was enough to make the sound of lady russell's carriage exceedingly welcome and yet though desirous to be gone she could not quit the mansion house or look an adieu to the cottage with its black dripping and comfortless veranda or even notice through the misty glasses the last humble tenements of the village without a saddened heart scenes had passed in uppercross which made it precious it stood the record of many sensations of pain once severe but now softened and of some instances of relenting feeling some breathings of friendship and reconciliation which could never be looked for again and which could never cease to be dear she left it all behind her all but the recollection that such things had been anne had never entered kellynch since her quitting lady russell's house in september it had not been necessary and the few occasions of its being possible for her to go to the hall she had contrived to evade and escape from her first return was to resume her place in the modern and elegant apartments of the lodge and to gladden the eyes of its mistress there was some anxiety mixed with lady russell's joy in meeting her she knew who had been frequenting uppercross but happily either anne was improved in plumpness and looks or lady russell fancied her so and anne in receiving her compliments on the occasion had the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration of her cousin and of hoping that she was to be blessed with a second spring of youth and beauty when they came to converse she was soon sensible of some mental change the subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving kellynch and which she had felt slighted and been compelled to smother among the musgroves were now become but of secondary interest she had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and bath their concerns had been sunk under those of uppercross and when lady russell reverted to their former hopes and fears and spoke her satisfaction in the house in camden place which had been taken and her regret that mrs clay should still be with them anne would have been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of lyme and louisa musgrove and all her acquaintance there how much more interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the harvilles and captain benwick than her own father's house in camden place or her own sister's intimacy with mrs clay she was actually forced to exert herself to meet lady russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude on topics which had by nature the first claim on her there was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse on another subject they must speak of the accident at lyme lady russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before when a full account of the whole had burst on her but still it must be talked of she must make enquiries she must regret the imprudence lament the result and captain wentworth's name must be mentioned by both anne was conscious of not doing it so well as lady russell she could not speak the name and look straight forward to lady russell's eye till she had
