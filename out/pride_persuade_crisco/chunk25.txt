at rosings a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification but when mrs phillips understood from him what rosings was and who was its proprietor when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherines drawing-rooms and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all the force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeepers room in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode and the improvements it was receiving he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them and he found in mrs phillips a very attentive listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could to the girls who could not listen to their cousin and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece the interval of waiting appeared very long it was over at last however the gentlemen did approach and when mr wickham walked into the room elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinking of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration the officers of the shire were in general a very creditable gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party but mr wickham was as far beyond them all in person countenance air and walk as they were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle phillips breathing port wine who followed them into the room mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night made her feel that the commonest dullest most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr wickham and the officers mr collins seemed to sink into insignificance to the young ladies he certainly was nothing but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs phillips and was by her watchfulness most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin when the card-tables were placed he had the opportunity of obliging her in turn by sitting down to whist i know little of the game at present said he but i shall be glad to improve myself for in my situation in life mrs phillips was very glad for his compliance but could not wait for his reason mr wickham did not play at whist and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia at first there seemed danger of lydias engrossing him entirely for she was a most determined talker but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular allowing for the common demands of the game mr wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to hear him though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told the history of his acquaintance with mr darcy she dared not even mention that gentleman her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved mr wickham began the subject himself he enquired how far netherfield was from meryton and after receiving her answer asked in a hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been staying there about a month said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subject drop added he is a man of very large property in derbyshire i understand yes replied mr wickham his estate there is a noble one a clear ten thousand per annum you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy elizabeth could not but look surprised you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday are you much acquainted with mr darcy as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth very warmly i have spent four days in the same house with him and i think him very disagreeable i have no right to give my opinion said wickham as to his being agreeable or otherwise i am not qualified to form one i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge it is impossible for me to be impartial but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else here you are in your own family upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood except netherfield he is not at all liked in hertfordshire everybody is disgusted with his pride you will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone i cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham after a short
