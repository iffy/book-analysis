of mind but descended into the passage dragging his unfortunate companion with him then half-carrying half-supporting him he managed to reach the abbs chamber when he immediately laid the sufferer on his bed thanks said the poor abb shivering as though his veins were filled with ice i am about to be seized with a fit of catalepsy when it comes to its height i shall probably lie still and motionless as though dead uttering neither sigh nor groan on the other hand the symptoms may be much more violent and cause me to fall into fearful convulsions foam at the mouth and cry out loudly take care my cries are not heard for if they are it is more than probable i should be removed to another part of the prison and we be separated forever when i become quite motionless cold and rigid as a corpse then and not before be careful about this force open my teeth with the knife pour from eight to ten drops of the liquor contained in the phial down my throat and i may perhaps revive perhaps exclaimed dants in grief-stricken tones help help cried the abb i i die i m so sudden and violent was the fit that the unfortunate prisoner was unable to complete the sentence a violent convulsion shook his whole frame his eyes started from their sockets his mouth was drawn on one side his cheeks became purple he struggled foamed dashed himself about and uttered the most dreadful cries which however dants prevented from being heard by covering his head with the blanket the fit lasted two hours then more helpless than an infant and colder and paler than marble more crushed and broken than a reed trampled under foot he fell back doubled up in one last convulsion and became as rigid as a corpse edmond waited till life seemed extinct in the body of his friend then taking up the knife he with difficulty forced open the closely fixed jaws carefully administered the appointed number of drops and anxiously awaited the result an hour passed away and the old man gave no sign of returning animation dants began to fear he had delayed too long ere he administered the remedy and thrusting his hands into his hair continued gazing on the lifeless features of his friend at length a slight color tinged the livid cheeks consciousness returned to the dull open eyeballs a faint sigh issued from the lips and the sufferer made a feeble effort to move he is saved he is saved cried dants in a paroxysm of delight the sick man was not yet able to speak but he pointed with evident anxiety towards the door dants listened and plainly distinguished the approaching steps of the jailer it was therefore near seven oclock but edmonds anxiety had put all thoughts of time out of his head the young man sprang to the entrance darted through it carefully drawing the stone over the opening and hurried to his cell he had scarcely done so before the door opened and the jailer saw the prisoner seated as usual on the side of his bed almost before the key had turned in the lock and before the departing steps of the jailer had died away in the long corridor he had to traverse dants whose restless anxiety concerning his friend left him no desire to touch the food brought him hurried back to the abbs chamber and raising the stone by pressing his head against it was soon beside the sick mans couch faria had now fully regained his consciousness but he still lay helpless and exhausted on his miserable bed i did not expect to see you again said he feebly to dants and why not asked the young man did you fancy yourself dying no i had no such idea but knowing that all was ready for flight i thought you might have made your escape the deep glow of indignation suffused the cheeks of dants without you did you really think me capable of that at least said the abb i now see how wrong such an opinion would have been alas alas i am fearfully exhausted and debilitated by this attack be of good cheer replied dants your strength will return and as he spoke he seated himself near the bed beside faria and took his hands the abb shook his head the last attack i had said he lasted but half an hour and after it i was hungry and got up without help now i can move neither my right arm nor leg and my head seems uncomfortable which shows that there has been a suffusion of blood on the brain the third attack will either carry me off or leave me paralyzed for life no no cried dants you are mistaken you will not die and your third attack if indeed you should have another will find you at liberty we shall save you another time as we have done this only with a better chance of success because we shall be able to command every requisite assistance my good edmond answered the abb be not deceived the attack which has just passed away condemns me forever to the walls of a prison none can fly from a dungeon who cannot walk well we will wait a week a
