of this marriage are you not yes really this is too absurd said villefort excuse me sir replied the notary on the contrary the meaning of m noirtier is quite evident to me and i can quite easily connect the train of ideas passing in his mind you do not wish me to marry m franz dpinay observed valentine i do not wish it said the eye of her grandfather and you disinherit your granddaughter continued the notary because she has contracted an engagement contrary to your wishes yes so that but for this marriage she would have been your heir yes there was a profound silence the two notaries were holding a consultation as to the best means of proceeding with the affair valentine was looking at her grandfather with a smile of intense gratitude and villefort was biting his lips with vexation while madame de villefort could not succeed in repressing an inward feeling of joy which in spite of herself appeared in her whole countenance but said villefort who was the first to break the silence i consider that i am the best judge of the propriety of the marriage in question i am the only person possessing the right to dispose of my daughters hand it is my wish that she should marry m franz dpinay and she shall marry him valentine sank weeping into a chair sir said the notary how do you intend disposing of your fortune in case mademoiselle de villefort still determines on marrying m franz the old man gave no answer you will of course dispose of it in some way or other yes in favor of some member of your family no do you intend devoting it to charitable purposes then pursued the notary yes but said the notary you are aware that the law does not allow a son to be entirely deprived of his patrimony yes you only intend then to dispose of that part of your fortune which the law allows you to subtract from the inheritance of your son noirtier made no answer do you still wish to dispose of all yes but they will contest the will after your death no my father knows me replied villefort he is quite sure that his wishes will be held sacred by me besides he understands that in my position i cannot plead against the poor the eye of noirtier beamed with triumph what do you decide on sir asked the notary of villefort nothing sir it is a resolution which my father has taken and i know he never alters his mind i am quite resigned these francs will go out of the family in order to enrich some hospital but it is ridiculous thus to yield to the caprices of an old man and i shall therefore act according to my conscience having said this villefort quitted the room with his wife leaving his father at liberty to do as he pleased the same day the will was made the witnesses were brought it was approved by the old man sealed in the presence of all and given in charge to m deschamps the family notary chapter the telegraph m and madame de villefort found on their return that the count of monte cristo who had come to visit them in their absence had been ushered into the drawing-room and was still awaiting them there madame de villefort who had not yet sufficiently recovered from her late emotion to allow of her entertaining visitors so immediately retired to her bedroom while the procureur who could better depend upon himself proceeded at once to the salon although m de villefort flattered himself that to all outward view he had completely masked the feelings which were passing in his mind he did not know that the cloud was still lowering on his brow so much so that the count whose smile was radiant immediately noticed his sombre and thoughtful air ma foi said monte cristo after the first compliments were over what is the matter with you m de villefort have i arrived at the moment when you were drawing up an indictment for a capital crime villefort tried to smile no count he replied i am the only victim in this case it is i who lose my cause and it is ill-luck obstinacy and folly which have caused it to be decided against me to what do you refer said monte cristo with well-feigned interest have you really met with some great misfortune oh no monsieur said villefort with a bitter smile it is only a loss of money which i have sustained nothing worth mentioning i assure you true said monte cristo the loss of a sum of money becomes almost immaterial with a fortune such as you possess and to one of your philosophic spirit it is not so much the loss of the money that vexes me said villefort though after all francs are worth regretting but i am the more annoyed with this fate chance or whatever you please to call the power which has destroyed my hopes and my fortune and may blast the prospects of my child also as it is all occasioned by an old man relapsed into second childhood m what do you say said the count francs it is indeed a sum which might be regretted even by a
