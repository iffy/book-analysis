on the sea what country does he come from i do not know have you ever seen him sometimes what sort of a man is he your excellency will judge for yourself where will he receive me no doubt in the subterranean palace gaetano told you of have you never had the curiosity when you have landed and found this island deserted to seek for this enchanted palace oh yes more than once but always in vain we examined the grotto all over but we never could find the slightest trace of any opening they say that the door is not opened by a key but a magic word decidedly muttered franz this is an arabian nights adventure his excellency waits for you said a voice which he recognized as that of the sentinel he was accompanied by two of the yachts crew franz drew his handkerchief from his pocket and presented it to the man who had spoken to him without uttering a word they bandaged his eyes with a care that showed their apprehensions of his committing some indiscretion afterwards he was made to promise that he would not make the least attempt to raise the bandage he promised then his two guides took his arms and he went on guided by them and preceded by the sentinel after going about thirty paces he smelt the appetizing odor of the kid that was roasting and knew thus that he was passing the bivouac they then led him on about fifty paces farther evidently advancing towards that part of the shore where they would not allow gaetano to go a refusal he could now comprehend presently by a change in the atmosphere he knew that they were entering a cave after going on for a few seconds more he heard a crackling and it seemed to him as though the atmosphere again changed and became balmy and perfumed at length his feet touched on a thick and soft carpet and his guides let go their hold of him there was a moments silence and then a voice in excellent french although with a foreign accent said welcome sir i beg you will remove your bandage it may be supposed then franz did not wait for a repetition of this permission but took off the handkerchief and found himself in the presence of a man from thirty-eight to forty years of age dressed in a tunisian costume that is to say a red cap with a long blue silk tassel a vest of black cloth embroidered with gold pantaloons of deep red large and full gaiters of the same color embroidered with gold like the vest and yellow slippers he had a splendid cashmere round his waist and a small sharp and crooked cangiar was passed through his girdle although of a paleness that was almost livid this man had a remarkably handsome face his eyes were penetrating and sparkling his nose quite straight and projecting direct from the brow was of the pure greek type while his teeth as white as pearls were set off to admiration by the black moustache that encircled them his pallor was so peculiar that it seemed to pertain to one who had been long entombed and who was incapable of resuming the healthy glow and hue of life he was not particularly tall but extremely well made and like the men of the south had small hands and feet but what astonished franz who had treated gaetanos description as a fable was the splendor of the apartment in which he found himself the entire chamber was lined with crimson brocade worked with flowers of gold in a recess was a kind of divan surmounted with a stand of arabian swords in silver scabbards and the handles resplendent with gems from the ceiling hung a lamp of venetian glass of beautiful shape and color while the feet rested on a turkey carpet in which they sunk to the instep tapestry hung before the door by which franz had entered and also in front of another door leading into a second apartment which seemed to be brilliantly illuminated the host gave franz time to recover from his surprise and moreover returned look for look not even taking his eyes off him sir he said after a pause a thousand excuses for the precaution taken in your introduction hither but as during the greater portion of the year this island is deserted if the secret of this abode were discovered i should doubtless find on my return my temporary retirement in a state of great disorder which would be exceedingly annoying not for the loss it occasioned me but because i should not have the certainty i now possess of separating myself from all the rest of mankind at pleasure let me now endeavor to make you forget this temporary unpleasantness and offer you what no doubt you did not expect to find here that is to say a tolerable supper and pretty comfortable beds ma foi my dear sir replied franz make no apologies i have always observed that they bandage peoples eyes who penetrate enchanted palaces for instance those of raoul in the huguenots and really i have nothing to complain of for what i see makes me think of the wonders of the arabian nights m alas i may say with lucullus if i could
