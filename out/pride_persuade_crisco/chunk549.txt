to bring to perfection how much does he spend yearly asked the prefect not more than five or six hundred thousand francs said lord wilmore he is a miser hatred evidently inspired the englishman who knowing no other reproach to bring on the count accused him of avarice do you know his house at auteuil certainly what do you know respecting it do you wish to know why he bought it yes the count is a speculator who will certainly ruin himself in experiments he supposes there is in the neighborhood of the house he has bought a mineral spring equal to those at bagnres luchon and cauterets he is going to turn his house into a badhaus as the germans term it he has already dug up all the garden two or three times to find the famous spring and being unsuccessful he will soon purchase all the contiguous houses now as i dislike him and hope his railway his electric telegraph or his search for baths will ruin him i am watching for his discomfiture which must soon take place what was the cause of your quarrel when he was in england he seduced the wife of one of my friends why do you not seek revenge i have already fought three duels with him said the englishman the first with the pistol the second with the sword and the third with the sabre and what was the result of those duels the first time he broke my arm the second he wounded me in the breast and the third time made this large wound the englishman turned down his shirt-collar and showed a scar whose redness proved it to be a recent one so that you see there is a deadly feud between us but said the envoy you do not go about it in the right way to kill him if i understand you correctly aw said the englishman i practice shooting every day and every other day grisier comes to my house this was all the visitor wished to ascertain or rather all the englishman appeared to know the agent arose and having bowed to lord wilmore who returned his salutation with the stiff politeness of the english he retired lord wilmore having heard the door close after him returned to his bedroom where with one hand he pulled off his light hair his red whiskers his false jaw and his wound to resume the black hair dark complexion and pearly teeth of the count of monte cristo it was m de villefort and not the prefect who returned to the house of m de villefort the procureur felt more at ease although he had learned nothing really satisfactory and for the first time since the dinner-party at auteuil he slept soundly chapter the ball it was in the warmest days of july when in due course of time the saturday arrived upon which the ball was to take place at m de morcerfs it was ten oclock at night the branches of the great trees in the garden of the counts house stood out boldly against the azure canopy of heaven which was studded with golden stars but where the last fleeting clouds of a vanishing storm yet lingered from the apartments on the ground floor might be heard the sound of music with the whirl of the waltz and galop while brilliant streams of light shone through the openings of the venetian blinds at this moment the garden was only occupied by about ten servants who had just received orders from their mistress to prepare the supper the serenity of the weather continuing to increase until now it had been undecided whether the supper should take place in the dining-room or under a long tent erected on the lawn but the beautiful blue sky studded with stars had settled the question in favor of the lawn the gardens were illuminated with colored lanterns according to the italian custom and as is usual in countries where the luxuries of the table the rarest of all luxuries in their complete form are well understood the supper-table was loaded with wax-lights and flowers m at the time the countess of morcerf returned to the rooms after giving her orders many guests were arriving more attracted by the charming hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the count for owing to the good taste of mercds one was sure of finding some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing or even copying in case of need madame danglars in whom the events we have related had caused deep anxiety had hesitated about going to madame de morcerfs when during the morning her carriage happened to meet that of villefort the latter made a sign and when the carriages had drawn close together said you are going to madame de morcerfs are you not no replied madame danglars i am too ill you are wrong replied villefort significantly it is important that you should be seen there do you think so asked the baroness i do in that case i will go and the two carriages passed on towards their different destinations madame danglars therefore came not only beautiful in person but radiant with splendor she entered by one door at the time when mercds appeared at the door the countess took albert to meet madame danglars
