metcalfs calling yesterday to thank me she finds miss pope a treasure lady catherine said she you have given me a treasure are any of your younger sisters out miss bennet yes maam all all what all five out at once very odd and you only the second the younger ones out before the elder ones are married your younger sisters must be very young yes my youngest is not sixteen perhaps she is full young to be much in company but really maam i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early the last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first and to be kept back on such a motive i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind upon my word said her ladyship you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person pray what is your age with three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence you cannot be more than twenty i am sure therefore you need not conceal your age i am not one-and-twenty when the gentlemen had joined them and tea was over the card-tables were placed lady catherine sir william and mr and mrs collins sat down to quadrille and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs jenkinson to make up her party their table was superlatively stupid scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game except when mrs jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourghs being too hot or too cold or having too much or too little light a great deal more passed at the other table lady catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others or relating some anecdote of herself mr collins was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said thanking her for every fish he won and apologising if he thought he won too many sir william did not say much he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose the tables were broken up the carriage was offered to mrs collins gratefully accepted and immediately ordered the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr collinss side and as many bows on sir williams they departed as soon as they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which for charlottes sake she made more favourable than it really was but her commendation though costing her some trouble could by no means satisfy mr collins and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyships praise into his own hands chapter sir william stayed only a week at hunsford but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughters being most comfortably settled and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with while sir william was with them mr collins devoted his morning to driving him out in his gig and showing him the country but when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing and looking out of the window in his own book-room which fronted the road the room in which the ladies sat was backwards elizabeth had at first rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use it was a better sized room and had a more pleasant aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did for mr collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement from the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to mr collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened almost every day she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and had a few minutes conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get out very few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to rosings and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of she could not understand
