as to promise me a galop i am rather late in claiming this gracious promise but here is my friend whose character for veracity you well know and he will assure you the delay arose from no fault of mine and as at this moment the orchestra gave the signal for the waltz albert put his arm round the waist of the countess and disappeared with her in the whirl of dancers in the meanwhile franz was considering the singular shudder that had passed over the count of monte cristo at the moment when he had been in some sort forced to give his hand to albert chapter the rendezvous the first words that albert uttered to his friend on the following morning contained a request that franz would accompany him on a visit to the count true the young man had warmly and energetically thanked the count on the previous evening but services such as he had rendered could never be too often acknowledged franz who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him and therefore made no objection to alberts request but at once accompanied him to the desired spot and after a short delay the count joined them in the salon my dear count said albert advancing to meet him permit me to repeat the poor thanks i offered last night and to assure you that the remembrance of all i owe to you will never be effaced from my memory believe me as long as i live i shall never cease to dwell with grateful recollection on the prompt and important service you rendered me and also to remember that to you i am indebted even for my life my very good friend and excellent neighbor replied the count with a smile you really exaggerate my trifling exertions you owe me nothing but some trifle of francs which you have been saved out of your travelling expenses so that there is not much of a score between us but you must really permit me to congratulate you on the ease and unconcern with which you resigned yourself to your fate and the perfect indifference you manifested as to the turn events might take upon my word said albert i deserve no credit for what i could not help namely a determination to take everything as i found it and to let those bandits see that although men get into troublesome scrapes all over the world there is no nation but the french that can smile even in the face of grim death himself all that however has nothing to do with my obligations to you and i now come to ask you whether in my own person my family or connections i can in any way serve you my father the comte de morcerf although of spanish origin possesses considerable influence both at the court of france and madrid and i unhesitatingly place the best services of myself and all to whom my life is dear at your disposal monsieur de morcerf replied the count your offer far from surprising me is precisely what i expected from you and i accept it in the same spirit of hearty sincerity with which it is made nay i will go still further and say that i had previously made up my mind to ask a great favor at your hands oh pray name it i am wholly a stranger to paris it is a city i have never yet seen is it possible exclaimed albert that you have reached your present age without visiting the finest capital in the world i can scarcely credit it nevertheless it is quite true still i agree with you in thinking that my present ignorance of the first city in europe is a reproach to me in every way and calls for immediate correction but in all probability i should have performed so important so necessary a duty as that of making myself acquainted with the wonders and beauties of your justly celebrated capital had i known any person who would have introduced me into the fashionable world but unfortunately i possessed no acquaintance there and of necessity was compelled to abandon the idea so distinguished an individual as yourself cried albert could scarcely have required an introduction you are most kind but as regards myself i can find no merit i possess save that as a millionaire i might have become a partner in the speculations of m aguado and m rothschild but as my motive in travelling to your capital would not have been for the pleasure of dabbling in stocks i stayed away till some favorable chance should present itself of carrying my wish into execution your offer however smooths all difficulties and i have only to ask you my dear m de morcerf these words were accompanied by a most peculiar smile whether you undertake upon my arrival in france to open to me the doors of that fashionable world of which i know no more than a huron or a native of cochin-china oh that i do and with infinite pleasure answered albert and so much the more readily as a letter received this morning from my
