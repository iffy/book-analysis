strong than he had attempted what he had not had sufficient resolution to undertake and had failed only because of an error in calculation this same person with almost incredible patience and perseverance had contrived to provide himself with tools requisite for so unparalleled an attempt another had done all this why then was it impossible to dants faria had dug his way through fifty feet dants would dig a hundred faria at the age of fifty had devoted three years to the task he who was but half as old would sacrifice six faria a priest and savant had not shrunk from the idea of risking his life by trying to swim a distance of three miles to one of the islands daume rattonneau or lemaire should a hardy sailor an experienced diver like himself shrink from a similar task should he who had so often for mere amusements sake plunged to the bottom of the sea to fetch up the bright coral branch hesitate to entertain the same project he could do it in an hour and how many times had he for pure pastime continued in the water for more than twice as long at once dants resolved to follow the brave example of his energetic companion and to remember that what has once been done may be done again after continuing some time in profound meditation the young man suddenly exclaimed i have found what you were in search of faria started have you indeed cried he raising his head with quick anxiety pray let me know what it is you have discovered the corridor through which you have bored your way from the cell you occupy here extends in the same direction as the outer gallery does it not m it does and is not above fifteen feet from it about that well then i will tell you what we must do we must pierce through the corridor by forming a side opening about the middle as it were the top part of a cross this time you will lay your plans more accurately we shall get out into the gallery you have described kill the sentinel who guards it and make our escape all we require to insure success is courage and that you possess and strength which i am not deficient in as for patience you have abundantly proved yours you shall now see me prove mine one instant my dear friend replied the abb it is clear you do not understand the nature of the courage with which i am endowed and what use i intend making of my strength as for patience i consider that i have abundantly exercised that in beginning every morning the task of the night before and every night renewing the task of the day but then young man and i pray of you to give me your full attention then i thought i could not be doing anything displeasing to the almighty in trying to set an innocent being at liberty one who had committed no offence and merited not condemnation and have your notions changed asked dants with much surprise do you think yourself more guilty in making the attempt since you have encountered me no neither do i wish to incur guilt hitherto i have fancied myself merely waging war against circumstances not men i have thought it no sin to bore through a wall or destroy a staircase but i cannot so easily persuade myself to pierce a heart or take away a life a slight movement of surprise escaped dants is it possible said he that where your liberty is at stake you can allow any such scruple to deter you from obtaining it tell me replied faria what has hindered you from knocking down your jailer with a piece of wood torn from your bedstead dressing yourself in his clothes and endeavoring to escape simply the fact that the idea never occurred to me answered dants because said the old man the natural repugnance to the commission of such a crime prevented you from thinking of it and so it ever is because in simple and allowable things our natural instincts keep us from deviating from the strict line of duty the tiger whose nature teaches him to delight in shedding blood needs but the sense of smell to show him when his prey is within his reach and by following this instinct he is enabled to measure the leap necessary to permit him to spring on his victim but man on the contrary loathes the idea of blood it is not alone that the laws of social life inspire him with a shrinking dread of taking life his natural construction and physiological formation dants was confused and silent at this explanation of the thoughts which had unconsciously been working in his mind or rather soul for there are two distinct sorts of ideas those that proceed from the head and those that emanate from the heart m since my imprisonment said faria i have thought over all the most celebrated cases of escape on record they have rarely been successful those that have been crowned with full success have been long meditated upon and carefully arranged such for instance as the escape of the duc de beaufort from the chteau de vincennes that of the abb dubuquoi from for levque of latude
