take another turn and cast you aloft while hurling me down adieu my dear grard and at your next journey alight at my door noirtier left the room when he had finished with the same calmness that had characterized him during the whole of this remarkable and trying conversation villefort pale and agitated ran to the window put aside the curtain and saw him pass cool and collected by two or three ill-looking men at the corner of the street who were there perhaps to arrest a man with black whiskers and a blue frock-coat and hat with broad brim villefort stood watching breathless until his father had disappeared at the rue bussy then he turned to the various articles he had left behind him put the black cravat and blue frock-coat at the bottom of the portmanteau threw the hat into a dark closet broke the cane into small bits and flung it in the fire put on his travelling-cap and calling his valet checked with a look the thousand questions he was ready to ask paid his bill sprang into his carriage which was ready learned at lyons that bonaparte had entered grenoble and in the midst of the tumult which prevailed along the road at length reached marseilles a prey to all the hopes and fears which enter into the heart of man with ambition and its first successes chapter the hundred days m noirtier was a true prophet and things progressed rapidly as he had predicted everyone knows the history of the famous return from elba a return which was unprecedented in the past and will probably remain without a counterpart in the future louis xviii made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow the monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious foundation and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of ancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground villefort therefore gained nothing save the kings gratitude which was rather likely to injure him at the present time and the cross of the legion of honor which he had the prudence not to wear although m de blacas had duly forwarded the brevet napoleon would doubtless have deprived villefort of his office had it not been for noirtier who was all powerful at court and thus the girondin of and the senator of protected him who so lately had been his protector all villeforts influence barely enabled him to stifle the secret dants had so nearly divulged the kings procureur alone was deprived of his office being suspected of royalism however scarcely was the imperial power established that is scarcely had the emperor re-entered the tuileries and begun to issue orders from the closet into which we have introduced our readers he found on the table there louis xviiis half-filled snuff-box scarcely had this occurred when marseilles began in spite of the authorities to rekindle the flames of civil war always smouldering in the south and it required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater violence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the royalists whenever they ventured abroad m owing to this change the worthy shipowner became at that moment we will not say all powerful because morrel was a prudent and rather a timid man so much so that many of the most zealous partisans of bonaparte accused him of moderation but sufficiently influential to make a demand in favor of dants villefort retained his place but his marriage was put off until a more favorable opportunity if the emperor remained on the throne grard required a different alliance to aid his career if louis xviii returned the influence of m de saint-mran like his own could be vastly increased and the marriage be still more suitable the deputy procureur was therefore the first magistrate of marseilles when one morning his door opened and m morrel was announced anyone else would have hastened to receive him but villefort was a man of ability and he knew this would be a sign of weakness he made morrel wait in the antechamber although he had no one with him for the simple reason that the kings procureur always makes everyone wait and after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers he ordered m morrel to be admitted morrel expected villefort would be dejected he found him as he had found him six weeks before calm firm and full of that glacial politeness that most insurmountable barrier which separates the well-bred from the vulgar man he had entered villeforts office expecting that the magistrate would tremble at the sight of him on the contrary he felt a cold shudder all over him when he saw villefort sitting there with his elbow on his desk and his head leaning on his hand he stopped at the door villefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him then after a brief interval during which the honest shipowner turned his hat in his hands m morrel i believe said villefort yes sir come nearer said the magistrate with a patronizing wave of the hand and tell me to what circumstance i owe the honor of this visit do you not guess monsieur asked morrel not in the least but if i can serve you in any way i shall be delighted
