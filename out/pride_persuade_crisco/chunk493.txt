to the command which had been given him had two hours before left for auteuil when a cab stopped at the door and after depositing its occupant at the gate immediately hurried away as if ashamed of its employment the visitor was about fifty-two years of age dressed in one of the green surtouts ornamented with black frogs which have so long maintained their popularity all over europe he wore trousers of blue cloth boots tolerably clean but not of the brightest polish and a little too thick in the soles buckskin gloves a hat somewhat resembling in shape those usually worn by the gendarmes and a black cravat striped with white which if the proprietor had not worn it of his own free will might have passed for a halter so much did it resemble one such was the picturesque costume of the person who rang at the gate and demanded if it was not at no in the avenue des champs-lyses that the count of monte cristo lived and who being answered by the porter in the affirmative entered closed the gate after him and began to ascend the steps the small and angular head of this man his white hair and thick gray moustaches caused him to be easily recognized by baptistin who had received an exact description of the expected visitor and who was awaiting him in the hall therefore scarcely had the stranger time to pronounce his name before the count was apprised of his arrival he was ushered into a simple and elegant drawing-room and the count rose to meet him with a smiling air ah my dear sir you are most welcome i was expecting you indeed said the italian was your excellency then aware of my visit yes i had been told that i should see you today at seven oclock then you have received full information concerning my arrival of course ah so much the better i feared this little precaution might have been forgotten m what precaution that of informing you beforehand of my coming oh no it has not but you are sure you are not mistaken very sure it really was i whom your excellency expected at seven oclock this evening i will prove it to you beyond a doubt oh no never mind that said the italian it is not worth the trouble yes yes said monte cristo his visitor appeared slightly uneasy let me see said the count are you not the marquis bartolomeo cavalcanti bartolomeo cavalcanti joyfully replied the italian yes i am really he ex-major in the austrian service was i a major timidly asked the old soldier yes said monte cristo you were a major that is the title the french give to the post which you filled in italy very good said the major i do not demand more you understand your visit here today is not of your own suggestion is it said monte cristo no certainly not you were sent by some other person yes by the excellent abb busoni exactly so said the delighted major and you have a letter yes there it is give it to me then and monte cristo took the letter which he opened and read the major looked at the count with his large staring eyes and then took a survey of the apartment but his gaze almost immediately reverted to the proprietor of the room yes yes i see major cavalcanti a worthy patrician of lucca a descendant of the cavalcanti of florence continued monte cristo reading aloud possessing an income of half a million monte cristo raised his eyes from the paper and bowed half a million said he magnificent half a million is it said the major yes in so many words and it must be so for the abb knows correctly the amount of all the largest fortunes in europe be it half a million then but on my word of honor i had no idea that it was so much because you are robbed by your steward you must make some reformation in that quarter you have opened my eyes said the italian gravely i will show the gentlemen the door monte cristo resumed the perusal of the letter and who only needs one thing more to make him happy yes indeed but one said the major with a sigh which is to recover a lost and adored son a lost and adored son stolen away in his infancy either by an enemy of his noble family or by the gypsies at the age of five years said the major with a deep sigh and raising his eye to heaven unhappy father said monte cristo the count continued i have given him renewed life and hope in the assurance that you have the power of restoring the son whom he has vainly sought for fifteen years the major looked at the count with an indescribable expression of anxiety i have the power of so doing said monte cristo the major recovered his self-possession so then said he the letter was true to the end did you doubt it my dear monsieur bartolomeo no indeed certainly not a good man a man holding religious office as does the abb busoni could not condescend to deceive or play off a joke but your excellency has not read all ah true said monte cristo
