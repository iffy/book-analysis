already too rich and perhaps when they have taken it they will leave me in peace and quietness you would love me as much if i were poor would you not maximilian oh i shall always love you what should i care for either riches or poverty if my valentine was near me and i felt certain that no one could deprive me of her but do you not fear that this communication may relate to your marriage i do not think that is the case however it may be valentine you must not be alarmed i assure you that as long as i live i shall never love anyone else do you think to reassure me when you say that maximilian pardon me you are right i am a brute but i was going to tell you that i met m de morcerf the other day well monsieur franz is his friend you know what then monsieur de morcerf has received a letter from franz announcing his immediate return valentine turned pale and leaned her hand against the gate ah heavens if it were that but no the communication would not come through madame de villefort why not because i scarcely know why but it has appeared as if madame de villefort secretly objected to the marriage although she did not choose openly to oppose it is it so then i feel as if i could adore madame de villefort do not be in such a hurry to do that said valentine with a sad smile if she objects to your marrying m dpinay she would be all the more likely to listen to any other proposition no maximilian it is not suitors to which madame de villefort objects it is marriage itself marriage if she dislikes that so much why did she ever marry herself you do not understand me maximilian about a year ago i talked of retiring to a convent madame de villefort in spite of all the remarks which she considered it her duty to make secretly approved of the proposition my father consented to it at her instigation and it was only on account of my poor grandfather that i finally abandoned the project you can form no idea of the expression of that old mans eye when he looks at me the only person in the world whom he loves and i had almost said by whom he is beloved in return when he learned my resolution i shall never forget the reproachful look which he cast on me and the tears of utter despair which chased each other down his lifeless cheeks ah maximilian i experienced at that moment such remorse for my intention that throwing myself at his feet i exclaimed forgive me pray forgive me my dear grandfather they may do what they will with me i will never leave you when i had ceased speaking he thankfully raised his eyes to heaven but without uttering a word ah maximilian i may have much to suffer but i feel as if my grandfathers look at that moment would more than compensate for all dear valentine you are a perfect angel and i am sure i do not know what i sabring right and left among the bedouins can have done to merit your being revealed to me unless indeed heaven took into consideration the fact that the victims of my sword were infidels but tell me what interest madame de villefort can have in your remaining unmarried did i not tell you just now that i was rich maximilian too rich i possess nearly livres in right of my mother my grandfather and my grandmother the marquis and marquise de saint-mran will leave me as much and m noirtier evidently intends making me his heir my brother edward who inherits nothing from his mother will therefore be poor in comparison with me now if i had taken the veil all this fortune would have descended to my father and in reversion to his son ah how strange it seems that such a young and beautiful woman should be so avaricious it is not for herself that she is so but for her son and what you regard as a vice becomes almost a virtue when looked at in the light of maternal love but could you not compromise matters and give up a portion of your fortune to her son how could i make such a proposition especially to a woman who always professes to be so entirely disinterested valentine i have always regarded our love in the light of something sacred consequently i have covered it with the veil of respect and hid it in the innermost recesses of my soul no human being not even my sister is aware of its existence valentine will you permit me to make a confidant of a friend and reveal to him the love i bear you valentine started a friend maximilian and who is this friend i tremble to give my permission listen valentine have you never experienced for anyone that sudden and irresistible sympathy which made you feel as if the object of it had been your old and familiar friend though in reality it was the first time you had ever met nay further have you never endeavored to recall the time place and circumstances of your former intercourse and failing
