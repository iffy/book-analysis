pleasant for the young people but that you should live with them so that you and valentine who are so attached to each other would not be separated and you would be able to pursue exactly the same course of life which you have hitherto done and thus instead of losing you will be a gainer by the change as it will secure to you two children instead of one to watch over and comfort you m noirtiers look was furious it was very evident that something desperate was passing in the old mans mind for a cry of anger and grief rose in his throat and not being able to find vent in utterance appeared almost to choke him for his face and lips turned quite purple with the struggle villefort quietly opened a window saying it is very warm and the heat affects m noirtier he then returned to his place but did not sit down this marriage added madame de villefort is quite agreeable to the wishes of m dpinay and his family besides he had no relations nearer than an uncle and aunt his mother having died at his birth and his father having been assassinated in that is to say when he was but two years old it naturally followed that the child was permitted to choose his own pursuits and he has therefore seldom acknowledged any other authority but that of his own will that assassination was a mysterious affair said villefort and the perpetrators have hitherto escaped detection although suspicion has fallen on the head of more than one person noirtier made such an effort that his lips expanded into a smile now continued villefort those to whom the guilt really belongs by whom the crime was committed on whose heads the justice of man may probably descend here and the certain judgment of god hereafter would rejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of bestowing such a peace-offering as valentine on the son of him whose life they so ruthlessly destroyed noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion more than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and shattered frame yes i understand was the reply contained in his look and this look expressed a feeling of strong indignation mixed with profound contempt villefort fully understood his fathers meaning and answered by a slight shrug of his shoulders he then motioned to his wife to take leave now sir said madame de villefort i must bid you farewell would you like me to send edward to you for a short time it had been agreed that the old man should express his approbation by closing his eyes his refusal by winking them several times and if he had some desire or feeling to express he raised them to heaven if he wanted valentine he closed his right eye only and if barrois the left at madame de villeforts proposition he instantly winked his eyes provoked by a complete refusal she bit her lip and said then shall i send valentine to you the old man closed his eyes eagerly thereby intimating that such was his wish m and madame de villefort bowed and left the room giving orders that valentine should be summoned to her grandfathers presence and feeling sure that she would have much to do to restore calmness to the perturbed spirit of the invalid valentine with a color still heightened by emotion entered the room just after her parents had quitted it one look was sufficient to tell her that her grandfather was suffering and that there was much on his mind which he was wishing to communicate to her dear grandpapa cried she what has happened they have vexed you and you are angry the paralytic closed his eyes in token of assent who has displeased you is it my father no madame de villefort no me the former sign was repeated are you displeased with me cried valentine in astonishment m noirtier again closed his eyes and what have i done dear grandpapa that you should be angry with me cried valentine there was no answer and she continued i have not seen you all day has anyone been speaking to you against me yes said the old mans look with eagerness let me think a moment i do assure you grandpapa ah m and madame de villefort have just left this room have they not yes and it was they who told you something which made you angry what was it then may i go and ask them that i may have the opportunity of making my peace with you no no said noirtiers look ah you frighten me what can they have said and she again tried to think what it could be ah i know said she lowering her voice and going close to the old man they have been speaking of my marriage have they not yes replied the angry look i understand you are displeased at the silence i have preserved on the subject the reason of it was that they had insisted on my keeping the matter a secret and begged me not to tell you anything of it they did not even acquaint me with their intentions and i only discovered them by chance that is why i have been so reserved with you dear grandpapa pray forgive me but there
