but there was no reason why anyone should notice his doing so villefort being called on to prove the crime was preparing his brief with the same ardor that he was accustomed to exercise when required to speak in criminal cases but three weeks had already passed and the most diligent search had been unsuccessful the attempted robbery and the murder of the robber by his comrade were almost forgotten in anticipation of the approaching marriage of mademoiselle danglars to the count andrea cavalcanti it was expected that this wedding would shortly take place as the young man was received at the bankers as the betrothed letters had been despatched to m cavalcanti as the counts father who highly approved of the union regretted his inability to leave parma at that time and promised a wedding gift of a hundred and fifty thousand livres it was agreed that the three millions should be intrusted to danglars to invest some persons had warned the young man of the circumstances of his future father-in-law who had of late sustained repeated losses but with sublime disinterestedness and confidence the young man refused to listen or to express a single doubt to the baron the baron adored count andrea cavalcanti not so mademoiselle eugnie danglars with an instinctive hatred of matrimony she suffered andreas attentions in order to get rid of morcerf but when andrea urged his suit she betrayed an entire dislike to him the baron might possibly have perceived it but attributing it to a caprice feigned ignorance the delay demanded by beauchamp had nearly expired morcerf appreciated the advice of monte cristo to let things die away of their own accord no one had taken up the remark about the general and no one had recognized in the officer who betrayed the castle of yanina the noble count in the house of peers albert however felt no less insulted the few lines which had irritated him were certainly intended as an insult besides the manner in which beauchamp had closed the conference left a bitter recollection in his heart he cherished the thought of the duel hoping to conceal its true cause even from his seconds beauchamp had not been seen since the day he visited albert and those of whom the latter inquired always told him he was out on a journey which would detain him some days where he was no one knew one morning albert was awakened by his valet de chambre who announced beauchamp albert rubbed his eyes ordered his servant to introduce him into the small smoking-room on the ground floor dressed himself quickly and went down he found beauchamp pacing the room on perceiving him beauchamp stopped your arrival here without waiting my visit at your house today looks well sir said albert tell me may i shake hands with you saying beauchamp acknowledge you have injured me and retain my friendship or must i simply propose to you a choice of arms albert said beauchamp with a look of sorrow which stupefied the young man let us first sit down and talk rather sir before we sit down i must demand your answer albert said the journalist these are questions which it is difficult to answer i will facilitate it by repeating the question will you or will you not retract morcerf it is not enough to answer yes or no to questions which concern the honor the social interest and the life of such a man as lieutenant-gnral the count of morcerf peer of france what must then be done m what i have done albert i reasoned thus money time and fatigue are nothing compared with the reputation and interests of a whole family probabilities will not suffice only facts will justify a deadly combat with a friend if i strike with the sword or discharge the contents of a pistol at man with whom for three years i have been on terms of intimacy i must at least know why i do so i must meet him with a heart at ease and that quiet conscience which a man needs when his own arm must save his life well said morcerf impatiently what does all this mean it means that i have just returned from yanina from yanina yes impossible here is my passport examine the visa geneva milan venice trieste delvino yanina will you believe the government of a republic a kingdom and an empire albert cast his eyes on the passport then raised them in astonishment to beauchamp you have been to yanina said he albert had you been a stranger a foreigner a simple lord like that englishman who came to demand satisfaction three or four months since and whom i killed to get rid of i should not have taken this trouble but i thought this mark of consideration due to you i took a week to go another to return four days of quarantine and forty-eight hours to stay there that makes three weeks i returned last night and here i am what circumlocution how long you are before you tell me what i most wish to know because in truth albert you hesitate yes i fear you fear to acknowledge that your correspondent has deceived you oh no self-love beauchamp acknowledge it beauchamp your courage cannot be doubted not so murmured the journalist on the contrary albert
