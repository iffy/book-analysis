feel for a misfortune that they have escaped yesterday and which may overtake them tomorrow a few drops of the rum restored suspended animation while the friction of his limbs restored their elasticity who are you said the pilot in bad french i am replied dants in bad italian a maltese sailor we were coming from syracuse laden with grain the storm of last night overtook us at cape morgiou and we were wrecked on these rocks where do you come from from these rocks that i had the good luck to cling to while our captain and the rest of the crew were all lost i saw your vessel and fearful of being left to perish on the desolate island i swam off on a piece of wreckage to try and intercept your course you have saved my life and i thank you continued dants i was lost when one of your sailors caught hold of my hair it was i said a sailor of a frank and manly appearance and it was time for you were sinking yes returned dants holding out his hand i thank you again i almost hesitated though replied the sailor you looked more like a brigand than an honest man with your beard six inches and your hair a foot long dants recollected that his hair and beard had not been cut all the time he was at the chteau dif yes said he i made a vow to our lady of the grotto not to cut my hair or beard for ten years if i were saved in a moment of danger but today the vow expires now what are we to do with you said the captain alas anything you please my captain is dead i have barely escaped but i am a good sailor leave me at the first port you make i shall be sure to find employment do you know the mediterranean i have sailed over it since my childhood you know the best harbors there are few ports that i could not enter or leave with a bandage over my eyes i say captain said the sailor who had cried courage to dants if what he says is true what hinders his staying with us if he says true said the captain doubtingly but in his present condition he will promise anything and take his chance of keeping it afterwards i will do more than i promise said dants we shall see returned the other smiling where are you going asked dants to leghorn then why instead of tacking so frequently do you not sail nearer the wind because we should run straight on to the island of rion you shall pass it by twenty fathoms take the helm and let us see what you know the young man took the helm felt to see if the vessel answered the rudder promptly and seeing that without being a first-rate sailor she yet was tolerably obedient to the sheets said he the four seamen who composed the crew obeyed while the pilot looked on haul taut they obeyed belay this order was also executed and the vessel passed as dants had predicted twenty fathoms to windward bravo said the captain bravo repeated the sailors and they all looked with astonishment at this man whose eye now disclosed an intelligence and his body a vigor they had not thought him capable of showing you see said dants quitting the helm i shall be of some use to you at least during the voyage if you do not want me at leghorn you can leave me there and i will pay you out of the first wages i get for my food and the clothes you lend me ah said the captain we can agree very well if you are reasonable give me what you give the others and it will be all right returned dants thats not fair said the seaman who had saved dants for you know more than we do what is that to you jacopo returned the captain everyone is free to ask what he pleases thats true replied jacopo i only make a remark well you would do much better to find him a jacket and a pair of trousers if you have them no said jacopo but i have a shirt and a pair of trousers that is all i want interrupted dants jacopo dived into the hold and soon returned with what edmond wanted now then do you wish for anything else said the patron a piece of bread and another glass of the capital rum i tasted for i have not eaten or drunk for a long time he had not tasted food for forty hours a piece of bread was brought and jacopo offered him the gourd larboard your helm cried the captain to the steersman dants glanced that way as he lifted the gourd to his mouth then paused with hand in mid-air hollo whats the matter at the chteau dif said the captain a small white cloud which had attracted dants attention crowned the summit of the bastion of the chteau dif at the same moment the faint report of a gun was heard the sailors looked at one another what is this asked the captain a prisoner has escaped from the chteau dif and they are firing the alarm gun
