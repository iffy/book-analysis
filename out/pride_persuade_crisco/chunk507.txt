it it was the medium through which his thanks were conveyed in short his whole appearance produced on the mind the impression of a corpse with living eyes and nothing could be more startling than to observe the expression of anger or joy suddenly lighting up these organs while the rest of the rigid and marble-like features were utterly deprived of the power of participation three persons only could understand this language of the poor paralytic these were villefort valentine and the old servant of whom we have already spoken but as villefort saw his father but seldom and then only when absolutely obliged and as he never took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there all the old mans happiness was centred in his granddaughter valentine by means of her love her patience and her devotion had learned to read in noirtiers look all the varied feelings which were passing in his mind to this dumb language which was so unintelligible to others she answered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her countenance and in this manner were the conversations sustained between the blooming girl and the helpless invalid whose body could scarcely be called a living one but who nevertheless possessed a fund of knowledge and penetration united with a will as powerful as ever although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying its impulses valentine had solved the problem and was able easily to understand his thoughts and to convey her own in return and through her untiring and devoted assiduity it was seldom that in the ordinary transactions of every-day life she failed to anticipate the wishes of the living thinking mind or the wants of the almost inanimate body as to the servant he had as we have said been with his master for five-and-twenty years therefore he knew all his habits and it was seldom that noirtier found it necessary to ask for anything so prompt was he in administering to all the necessities of the invalid villefort did not need the help of either valentine or the domestic in order to carry on with his father the strange conversation which he was about to begin as we have said he perfectly understood the old mans vocabulary and if he did not use it more often it was only indifference and ennui which prevented him from so doing he therefore allowed valentine to go into the garden sent away barrois and after having seated himself at his fathers right hand while madame de villefort placed herself on the left he addressed him thus i trust you will not be displeased sir that valentine has not come with us or that i dismissed barrois for our conference will be one which could not with propriety be carried on in the presence of either madame de villefort and i have a communication to make to you noirtiers face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble while on the contrary villeforts eye was endeavoring to penetrate into the inmost recesses of the old mans heart this communication continued the procureur in that cold and decisive tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion will we are sure meet with your approbation the eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which prevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which were passing in his mind he listened nothing more sir resumed villefort we are thinking of marrying valentine had the old mans face been moulded in wax it could not have shown less emotion at this news than was now to be traced there the marriage will take place in less than three months said villefort noirtiers eye still retained its inanimate expression madame de villefort now took her part in the conversation and added we thought this news would possess an interest for you sir who have always entertained a great affection for valentine it therefore only now remains for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she is destined it is one of the most desirable connections which could possibly be formed he possesses fortune a high rank in society and every personal qualification likely to render valentine supremely happy his name moreover cannot be wholly unknown to you it is m franz de quesnel baron dpinay while his wife was speaking villefort had narrowly watched the old mans countenance when madame de villefort pronounced the name of franz the pupil of m noirtiers eye began to dilate and his eyelids trembled with the same movement that may be perceived on the lips of an individual about to speak and he darted a lightning glance at madame de villefort and his son the procureur who knew the political hatred which had formerly existed between m noirtier and the elder dpinay well understood the agitation and anger which the announcement had produced but feigning not to perceive either he immediately resumed the narrative begun by his wife sir said he you are aware that valentine is about to enter her nineteenth year which renders it important that she should lose no time in forming a suitable alliance nevertheless you have not been forgotten in our plans and we have fully ascertained beforehand that valentines future husband will consent not to live in this house for that might not be
