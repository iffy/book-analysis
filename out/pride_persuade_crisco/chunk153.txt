that he was expected and speedily but the musgroves in their warm gratitude for the kindness he had shewn poor dick and very high respect for his character stamped as it was by poor dicks having been six months under his care and mentioning him in strong though not perfectly well-spelt praise as a fine dashing felow only two perticular about the schoolmaster were bent on introducing themselves and seeking his acquaintance as soon as they could hear of his arrival the resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening chapter a very few days more and captain wentworth was known to be at kellynch and mr musgrove had called on him and come back warm in his praise and he was engaged with the crofts to dine at uppercross by the end of another week it had been a great disappointment to mr musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed so impatient was he to shew his gratitude by seeing captain wentworth under his own roof and welcoming him to all that was strongest and best in his cellars but a week must pass only a week in annes reckoning and then she supposed they must meet and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week captain wentworth made a very early return to mr musgroves civility and she was all but calling there in the same half hour she and mary were actually setting forward for the great house where as she afterwards learnt they must inevitably have found him when they were stopped by the eldest boys being at that moment brought home in consequence of a bad fall the childs situation put the visit entirely aside but she could not hear of her escape with indifference even in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on his account his collar-bone was found to be dislocated and such injury received in the back as roused the most alarming ideas it was an afternoon of distress and anne had every thing to do at once the apothecary to send for the father to have pursued and informed the mother to support and keep from hysterics the servants to control the youngest child to banish and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe besides sending as soon as she recollected it proper notice to the other house which brought her an accession rather of frightened enquiring companions than of very useful assistants her brothers return was the first comfort he could take best care of his wife and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary till he came and had examined the child their apprehensions were the worse for being vague they suspected great injury but knew not where but now the collar-bone was soon replaced and though mr robinson felt and felt and rubbed and looked grave and spoke low words both to the father and the aunt still they were all to hope the best and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind and then it was just before they parted that the two young aunts were able so far to digress from their nephews state as to give the information of captain wentworths visit staying five minutes behind their father and mother to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with him how much handsomer how infinitely more agreeable they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance who had been at all a favourite before how glad they had been to hear papa invite him to stay dinner how sorry when he said it was quite out of his power and how glad again when he had promised in reply to papa and mammas farther pressing invitations to come and dine with them on the morrow--actually on the morrow and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner as if he felt all the motive of their attention just as he ought and in short he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace that they could assure them all their heads were both turned by him and off they ran quite as full of glee as of love and apparently more full of captain wentworth than of little charles the same story and the same raptures were repeated when the two girls came with their father through the gloom of the evening to make enquiries and mr musgrove no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir could add his confirmation and praise and hope there would be now no occasion for putting captain wentworth off and only be sorry to think that the cottage party probably would not like to leave the little boy to give him the meeting oh no as to leaving the little boy both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm to bear the thought and anne in the joy of the escape could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs charles musgrove indeed afterwards shewed more of inclination the child was going on so well and he wished so much to be introduced to captain wentworth that perhaps he might join them in the evening he would not dine from home but he might walk in for half an hour but in this he was
