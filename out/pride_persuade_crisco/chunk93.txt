but himself yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs gardiner thought of him and mrs gardiner would have been highly gratified by her nieces beginning the subject chapter elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane on their first arrival at lambton and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there but on the third her repining was over and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere elizabeth was not surprised at it as jane had written the direction remarkably ill they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in and her uncle and aunt leaving her to enjoy them in quiet set off by themselves the one missent must first be attended to it had been written five days ago the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements with such news as the country afforded but the latter half which was dated a day later and written in evident agitation gave more important intelligence it was to this effect since writing the above dearest lizzy something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature but i am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well what i have to say relates to poor lydia an express came at twelve last night just as we were all gone to bed from colonel forster to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers to own the truth with wickham imagine our surprise to kitty however it does not seem so wholly unexpected i am very very sorry so imprudent a match on both sides but i am willing to hope the best and that his character has been misunderstood thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart his choice is disinterested at least for he must know my father can give her nothing our poor mother is sadly grieved my father bears it better how thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against him we must forget it ourselves they were off saturday night about twelve as is conjectured but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight the express was sent off directly my dear lizzy they must have passed within ten miles of us colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon lydia left a few lines for his wife informing her of their intention i must conclude for i cannot be long from my poor mother i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardly know what i have written without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing what she felt elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first by this time my dearest sister you have received my hurried letter i wish this may be more intelligible but though not confined for time my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent dearest lizzy i hardly know what i would write but i have bad news for you and it cannot be delayed imprudent as the marriage between mr wickham and our poor lydia would be we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland colonel forster came yesterday having left brighton the day before not many hours after the express though lydias short letter to mrs f gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w never intended to go there or to marry lydia at all which was repeated to colonel f who instantly taking the alarm set off from b intending to trace their route he did trace them easily to clapham but no further for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom all that is known after this is that they were seen to continue the london road i know not what to think after making every possible enquiry on that side london colonel f came on into hertfordshire anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes and at the inns in barnet and hatfield but without any success no such people had been seen to pass through with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs f but no one can throw any blame on them our distress my dear lizzy is very great my father and mother believe the worst but i cannot think so ill of him many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of lydias connections which is not likely can i suppose her so lost to
