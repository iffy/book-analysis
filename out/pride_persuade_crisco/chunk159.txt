admiral after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room with his hands behind him being called to order by his wife now came up to captain wentworth and without any observation of what he might be interrupting thinking only of his own thoughts began with if you had been a week later at lisbon last spring frederick you would have been asked to give a passage to lady mary grierson and her daughters should i i am glad i was not a week later then the admiral abused him for his want of gallantry he defended himself though professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies on board a ship of his excepting for a ball or a visit which a few hours might comprehend but if i know myself said he this is from no want of gallantry towards them it is rather from feeling how impossible it is with all ones efforts and all ones sacrifices to make the accommodations on board such as women ought to have there can be no want of gallantry admiral in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high and this is what i do i hate to hear of women on board or to see them on board and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere if i can help it this brought his sister upon him oh frederick but i cannot believe it of you--all idle refinement--women may be as comfortable on board as in the best house in england i believe i have lived as much on board as most women and i know nothing superior to the accommodations of a man-of-war i declare i have not a comfort or an indulgence about me even at kellynch hall with a kind bow to anne beyond what i always had in most of the ships i have lived in and they have been five altogether nothing to the purpose replied her brother you were living with your husband and were the only woman on board but you yourself brought mrs harville her sister her cousin and three children round from portsmouth to plymouth where was this superfine extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then all merged in my friendship sophia i would assist any brother officers wife that i could and i would bring anything of harvilles from the worlds end if he wanted it but do not imagine that i did not feel it an evil in itself depend upon it they were all perfectly comfortable i might not like them the better for that perhaps such a number of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board my dear frederick you are talking quite idly pray what would become of us poor sailors wives who often want to be conveyed to one port or another after our husbands if everybody had your feelings my feelings you see did not prevent my taking mrs harville and all her family to plymouth but i hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman and as if women were all fine ladies instead of rational creatures we none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days ah my dear said the admiral when he had got a wife he will sing a different tune when he is married if we have the good luck to live to another war we shall see him do as you and i and a great many others have done we shall have him very thankful to anybody that will bring him his wife ay that we shall now i have done cried captain wentworth when once married people begin to attack me with--oh you will think very differently when you are married i can only say no i shall not and then they say again yes you will and there is an end of it he got up and moved away what a great traveller you must have been maam said mrs musgrove to mrs croft pretty well maam in the fifteen years of my marriage though many women have done more i have crossed the atlantic four times and have been once to the east indies and back again and only once besides being in different places about home cork and lisbon and gibraltar but i never went beyond the streights and never was in the west indies we do not call bermuda or bahama you know the west indies mrs musgrove had not a word to say in dissent she could not accuse herself of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life and i do assure you maam pursued mrs croft that nothing can exceed the accommodations of a man-of-war i speak you know of the higher rates when you come to a frigate of course you are more confined though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them and i can safely say that the happiest part of my life has been spent on board a ship while we were together you know there was nothing to be feared thank god i have always been blessed with excellent health and no climate disagrees with me a little disordered always the first twenty-four hours of going to sea but never knew what sickness was afterwards the only time i
