bay which in the season is animated with bathing machines and company the cobb itself its old wonders and new improvements with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town are what the stranger's eye will seek and a very strange stranger it must be who does not see charms in the immediate environs of lyme to make him wish to know it better the scenes in its neighbourhood charmouth with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country and still more its sweet retired bay backed by dark cliffs where fragments of low rock among the sands make it the happiest spot for watching the flow of the tide for sitting in unwearied contemplation the woody varieties of the cheerful village of up lyme and above all pinny with its green chasms between romantic rocks where the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth declare that many a generation must have passed away since the first partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited as may more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far-famed isle of wight these places must be visited and visited again to make the worth of lyme understood the party from uppercross passing down by the now deserted and melancholy looking rooms and still descending soon found themselves on the sea-shore and lingering only as all must linger and gaze on a first return to the sea who ever deserved to look on it at all proceeded towards the cobb equally their object in itself and on captain wentworth's account for in a small house near the foot of an old pier of unknown date were the harvilles settled captain wentworth turned in to call on his friend the others walked on and he was to join them on the cobb they were by no means tired of wondering and admiring and not even louisa seemed to feel that they had parted with captain wentworth long when they saw him coming after them with three companions all well known already by description to be captain and mrs harville and a captain benwick who was staying with them captain benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the laconia and the account which captain wentworth had given of him on his return from lyme before his warm praise of him as an excellent young man and an officer whom he had always valued highly which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener had been followed by a little history of his private life which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies he had been engaged to captain harville's sister and was now mourning her loss they had been a year or two waiting for fortune and promotion fortune came his prize-money as lieutenant being great promotion too came at last but fanny harville did not live to know it she had died the preceding summer while he was at sea captain wentworth believed it impossible for man to be more attached to woman than poor benwick had been to fanny harville or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadful change he considered his disposition as of the sort which must suffer heavily uniting very strong feelings with quiet serious and retiring manners and a decided taste for reading and sedentary pursuits to finish the interest of the story the friendship between him and the harvilles seemed if possible augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance and captain benwick was now living with them entirely captain harville had taken his present house for half a year his taste and his health and his fortune all directing him to a residence inexpensive and by the sea and the grandeur of the country and the retirement of lyme in the winter appeared exactly adapted to captain benwick's state of mind the sympathy and good-will excited towards captain benwick was very great and yet said anne to herself as they now moved forward to meet the party he has not perhaps a more sorrowing heart than i have i cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever he is younger than i am younger in feeling if not in fact younger as a man he will rally again and be happy with another they all met and were introduced captain harville was a tall dark man with a sensible benevolent countenance a little lame and from strong features and want of health looking much older than captain wentworth captain benwick looked and was the youngest of the three and compared with either of them a little man he had a pleasing face and a melancholy air just as he ought to have and drew back from conversation captain harville though not equalling captain wentworth in manners was a perfect gentleman unaffected warm and obliging mrs harville a degree less polished than her husband seemed however to have the same good feelings and nothing could be more pleasant than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own because the friends of captain wentworth or more kindly hospitable than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them the dinner already ordered at the inn was at last though unwillingly accepted
