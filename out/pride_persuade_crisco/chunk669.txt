money to pay my bill but i am not a dishonest man i leave behind me as a pledge this pin worth ten times the amount i shall be excused for leaving at daybreak for i was ashamed he then drew the pin from his cravat and placed it on the paper this done instead of leaving the door fastened he drew back the bolts and even placed the door ajar as though he had left the room forgetting to close it and slipping into the chimney like a man accustomed to that kind of gymnastic exercise after replacing the chimney-board which represented achilles with deidamia and effacing the very marks of his feet upon the ashes he commenced climbing the hollow tunnel which afforded him the only means of escape left at this precise time the first gendarme andrea had noticed walked upstairs preceded by the commissary of police and supported by the second gendarme who guarded the staircase and was himself reinforced by the one stationed at the door andrea was indebted for this visit to the following circumstances at daybreak the telegraphs were set at work in all directions and almost immediately the authorities in every district had exerted their utmost endeavors to arrest the murderer of caderousse compigne that royal residence and fortified town is well furnished with authorities gendarmes and commissaries of police they therefore began operations as soon as the telegraphic despatch arrived and the bell and bottle being the best-known hotel in the town they had naturally directed their first inquiries there now besides the reports of the sentinels guarding the htel de ville which is next door to the bell and bottle it had been stated by others that a number of travellers had arrived during the night the sentinel who was relieved at six oclock in the morning remembered perfectly that just as he was taking his post a few minutes past four a young man arrived on horseback with a little boy before him the young man having dismissed the boy and horse knocked at the door of the hotel which was opened and again closed after his entrance this late arrival had attracted much suspicion and the young man being no other than andrea the commissary and gendarme who was a brigadier directed their steps towards his room they found the door ajar oh oh said the brigadier who thoroughly understood the trick a bad sign to find the door open i would rather find it triply bolted and indeed the little note and pin upon the table confirmed or rather corroborated the sad truth andrea had fled we say corroborated because the brigadier was too experienced to be convinced by a single proof he glanced around looked in the bed shook the curtains opened the closets and finally stopped at the chimney andrea had taken the precaution to leave no traces of his feet in the ashes but still it was an outlet and in this light was not to be passed over without serious investigation the brigadier sent for some sticks and straw and having filled the chimney with them set a light to it the fire crackled and the smoke ascended like the dull vapor from a volcano but still no prisoner fell down as they expected the fact was that andrea at war with society ever since his youth was quite as deep as a gendarme even though he were advanced to the rank of brigadier and quite prepared for the fire he had climbed out on the roof and was crouching down against the chimney-pots m at one time he thought he was saved for he heard the brigadier exclaim in a loud voice to the two gendarmes he is not here but venturing to peep he perceived that the latter instead of retiring as might have been reasonably expected upon this announcement were watching with increased attention it was now his turn to look about him the htel de ville a massive sixteenth century building was on his right anyone could descend from the openings in the tower and examine every corner of the roof below and andrea expected momentarily to see the head of a gendarme appear at one of these openings if once discovered he knew he would be lost for the roof afforded no chance of escape he therefore resolved to descend not through the same chimney by which he had come up but by a similar one conducting to another room he looked around for a chimney from which no smoke issued and having reached it he disappeared through the orifice without being seen by anyone at the same minute one of the little windows of the htel de ville was thrown open and the head of a gendarme appeared for an instant it remained motionless as one of the stone decorations of the building then after a long sigh of disappointment the head disappeared the brigadier calm and dignified as the law he represented passed through the crowd without answering the thousand questions addressed to him and re-entered the hotel well asked the two gendarmes well my boys said the brigadier the brigand must really have escaped early this morning but we will send to the villers-coterets and noyon roads and search the forest when we shall catch him no doubt the honorable functionary had scarcely expressed himself thus in
