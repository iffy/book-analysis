the words to be made public after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health good humour and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn everything wore a happier aspect the families who had been in town for the winter came back again and summer finery and summer engagements arose mrs bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office another regiment should be quartered in meryton the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter arrived from mrs gardiner which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent mr gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london again within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up the lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to the present plan were to go no farther northwards than derbyshire in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks and to mrs gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life and where they were now to spend a few days was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock chatsworth dovedale or the peak elizabeth was excessively disappointed she had set her heart on seeing the lakes and still thought there might have been time enough but it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy and all was soon right again with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner but surely said she i may enter his county with impunity and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me the period of expectation was now doubled four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunts arrival but they did pass away and mr and mrs gardiner with their four children did at length appear at longbourn the children two girls of six and eight years old and two younger boys were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane who was the general favourite and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them playing with them and loving them the gardiners stayed only one night at longbourn and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement one enjoyment was certain that of suitableness of companions a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure and affection and intelligence which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay oxford blenheim warwick kenilworth birmingham etc are sufficiently known a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern to the little town of lambton the scene of mrs gardiners former residence and where she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained they bent their steps after having seen all the principal wonders of the country and within five miles of lambton elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated it was not in their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it in talking over their route the evening before mrs gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again mr gardiner declared his willingness and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation my love should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much said her aunt a place too with which so many of your acquaintances are connected wickham passed all his youth there you know elizabeth was distressed she felt that she had no business at pemberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it she must own that she was tired of seeing great houses after going over so many she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains mrs gardiner abused her stupidity if it were merely a fine house richly furnished said she i should not care about it myself but the grounds are delightful they have some of the finest woods in the country elizabeth said no more but her mind could not acquiesce the possibility of meeting mr darcy while viewing the place instantly occurred it would be dreadful she blushed at the very idea and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk but against
