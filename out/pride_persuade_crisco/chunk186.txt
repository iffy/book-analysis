route understand something of hers and regret that he should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her she gave him a short account of her party and business at lyme his regret increased as he listened he had spent his whole solitary evening in the room adjoining theirs had heard voices mirth continually thought they must be a most delightful set of people longed to be with them but certainly without the smallest suspicion of his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself if he had but asked who the party were the name of musgrove would have told him enough well it would serve to cure him of an absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn which he had adopted when quite a young man on the principal of its being very ungenteel to be curious the notions of a young man of one or two and twenty said he as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing are more absurd i believe than those of any other set of beings in the world the folly of the means they often employ is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view but he must not be addressing his reflections to anne alone he knew it he was soon diffused again among the others and it was only at intervals that he could return to lyme his enquiries however produced at length an account of the scene she had been engaged in there soon after his leaving the place having alluded to an accident he must hear the whole when he questioned sir walter and elizabeth began to question also but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt she could only compare mr elliot to lady russell in the wish of really comprehending what had passed and in the degree of concern for what she must have suffered in witnessing it he staid an hour with them the elegant little clock on the mantel-piece had struck eleven with its silver sounds and the watchman was beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale before mr elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long anne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in camden place could have passed so well chapter there was one point which anne on returning to her family would have been more thankful to ascertain even than mr elliot's being in love with elizabeth which was her father's not being in love with mrs clay and she was very far from easy about it when she had been at home a few hours on going down to breakfast the next morning she found there had just been a decent pretence on the lady's side of meaning to leave them she could imagine mrs clay to have said that now miss anne was come she could not suppose herself at all wanted for elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper that must not be any reason indeed i assure you i feel it none she is nothing to me compared with you and she was in full time to hear her father say my dear madam this must not be as yet you have seen nothing of bath you have been here only to be useful you must not run away from us now you must stay to be acquainted with mrs wallis the beautiful mrs wallis to your fine mind i well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification he spoke and looked so much in earnest that anne was not surprised to see mrs clay stealing a glance at elizabeth and herself her countenance perhaps might express some watchfulness but the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought in her sister the lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties and promise to stay in the course of the same morning anne and her father chancing to be alone together he began to compliment her on her improved looks he thought her less thin in her person in her cheeks her skin her complexion greatly improved clearer fresher had she been using any thing in particular no nothing merely gowland he supposed no nothing at all ha he was surprised at that and added certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are you cannot be better than well or i should recommend gowland the constant use of gowland during the spring months mrs clay has been using it at my recommendation and you see what it has done for her you see how it has carried away her freckles if elizabeth could but have heard this such personal praise might have struck her especially as it did not appear to anne that the freckles were at all lessened but everything must take its chance the evil of a marriage would be much diminished if elizabeth were also to marry as for herself she might always command a home with lady russell lady russell's composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial on this point in her intercourse in camden place the sight of mrs clay in such favour and of anne so overlooked was a perpetual provocation to
