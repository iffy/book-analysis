former were many good paintings but elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such as had been already visible below she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcys in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting and also more intelligible in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger elizabeth walked in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her at last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance to mr darcy with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery mrs reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his fathers lifetime there was certainly at this moment in elizabeths mind a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of their acquaintance the commendation bestowed on him by mrs reynolds was of no trifling nature what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant as a brother a landlord a master she considered how many peoples happiness were in his guardianship how much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow how much of good or evil must be done by him every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his eyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its warmth and softened its impropriety of expression when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen they returned downstairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were consigned over to the gardener who met them at the hall-door as they walked across the hall towards the river elizabeth turned back to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables they were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was his appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight their eyes instantly met and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest blush he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr darcy the gardeners expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in her life nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn and of her stay in derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts at length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took leave the others then joined her and expressed admiration of his figure but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings followed them in silence she was overpowered by shame and vexation her coming there was the most unfortunate the most ill-judged thing in the world how strange it must appear to him in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again oh why did she come or why did he thus come a day before he was expected had they been only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination for it was plain that he was that moment arrived that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting and his behaviour so strikingly altered what could it mean that he should even speak to her was amazing but to speak with such civility to enquire after her family never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park
