arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning they were therefore to go elizabeth was pleased though when she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley before noon chapter convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingleys dislike of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with how much civility on that ladys side the acquaintance would now be renewed on reaching the house they were shown through the hall into the saloon whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer its windows opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn in this house they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there with mrs hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in london georgianas reception of them was very civil but attended with all the embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved mrs gardiner and her niece however did her justice and pitied her by mrs hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey and on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be succeeded for a few moments it was first broken by mrs annesley a genteel agreeable-looking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the others and between her and mrs gardiner with occasional help from elizabeth the conversation was carried on miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley and that she could not speak a word especially to miss darcy without calling her attention this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much her own thoughts were employing her she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room she wished she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them and whether she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss bingleys voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family she answered with equal indifference and brevity and the other said no more the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs annesley to miss darcy had been given to remind her of her post there was now employment for the whole party for though they could not all talk they could all eat and the beautiful pyramids of grapes nectarines and peaches soon collected them round the table while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr darcy by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room and then though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to regret that he came he had been some time with mr gardiner who with two or three other gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed a resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingleys in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects for jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her attentions to mr darcy were by no means over miss darcy on her brothers entrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side miss bingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger
