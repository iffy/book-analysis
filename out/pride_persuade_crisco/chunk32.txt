accosted her so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man quite forgot to tell you among his other communication that he was the son of old wickham the late mr darcys steward let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to mr darcys using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has always been remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated mr darcy in a most infamous manner i do not know the particulars but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourites guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr darcys steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himself i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer excuse my interference it was kindly meant insolent girl said elizabeth to herself you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr darcy she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make enquiries on the same subject of bingley jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and everything else gave way before the hope of janes being in the fairest way for happiness i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her sisters what you have learnt about mr wickham but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my pardon no replied jane i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you mr bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say by his account as well as his sisters mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr darcys regard mr bingley does not know mr wickham himself no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton this account then is what he has received from mr darcy i am satisfied but what does he say of the living he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from mr darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only i have not a doubt of mr bingleys sincerity said elizabeth warmly but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only mr bingleys defense of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as i did before she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sentiment elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of mr bingleys regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it on their being joined by mr bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose enquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before mr collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady catherine how wonderfully these sort of things occur who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time
