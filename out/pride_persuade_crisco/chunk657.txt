the purple lips of the young girl to practice obedience well asked danglars well sir replied eugnie i have tried to the very last and now that the moment has come i feel in spite of all my efforts that it is impossible but said danglars whose weak mind was at first quite overwhelmed with the weight of this pitiless logic marking evident premeditation and force of will what is your reason for this refusal eugnie what reason do you assign my reason replied the young girl well it is not that the man is more ugly more foolish or more disagreeable than any other no m andrea cavalcanti may appear to those who look at mens faces and figures as a very good specimen of his kind it is not either that my heart is less touched by him than any other that would be a schoolgirls reason which i consider quite beneath me i actually love no one sir you know it do you not i do not then see why without real necessity i should encumber my life with a perpetual companion has not some sage said nothing too much and another i carry all my effects with me i have been taught these two aphorisms in latin and in greek one is i believe from phdrus and the other from bias well my dear father in the shipwreck of life for life is an eternal shipwreck of our hopes i cast into the sea my useless encumbrance that is all and i remain with my own will disposed to live perfectly alone and consequently perfectly free unhappy girl unhappy girl murmured danglars turning pale for he knew from long experience the solidity of the obstacle he had so suddenly encountered unhappy girl replied eugnie unhappy girl do you say sir no indeed the exclamation appears quite theatrical and affected happy on the contrary for what am i in want of the world calls me beautiful it is something to be well received i like a favorable reception it expands the countenance and those around me do not then appear so ugly i possess a share of wit and a certain relative sensibility which enables me to draw from life in general for the support of mine all i meet with that is good like the monkey who cracks the nut to get at its contents i am rich for you have one of the first fortunes in france i am your only daughter and you are not so exacting as the fathers of the porte saint-martin and gat who disinherit their daughters for not giving them grandchildren besides the provident law has deprived you of the power to disinherit me at least entirely as it has also of the power to compel me to marry monsieur this or monsieur that and so being beautiful witty somewhat talented as the comic operas say and rich and that is happiness sir why do you call me unhappy danglars seeing his daughter smiling and proud even to insolence could not entirely repress his brutal feelings but they betrayed themselves only by an exclamation under the fixed and inquiring gaze levelled at him from under those beautiful black eyebrows he prudently turned away and calmed himself immediately daunted by the power of a resolute mind truly my daughter replied he with a smile you are all you boast of being excepting one thing i will not too hastily tell you which but would rather leave you to guess it eugnie looked at danglars much surprised that one flower of her crown of pride with which she had so superbly decked herself should be disputed my daughter continued the banker you have perfectly explained to me the sentiments which influence a girl like you who is determined she will not marry now it remains for me to tell you the motives of a father like me who has decided that his daughter shall marry eugnie bowed not as a submissive daughter but as an adversary prepared for a discussion my daughter continued danglars when a father asks his daughter to choose a husband he has always some reason for wishing her to marry some are affected with the mania of which you spoke just now that of living again in their grandchildren this is not my weakness i tell you at once family joys have no charm for me i may acknowledge this to a daughter whom i know to be philosophical enough to understand my indifference and not to impute it to me as a crime this is not to the purpose said eugnie let us speak candidly sir i admire candor oh said danglars i can when circumstances render it desirable adopt your system although it may not be my general practice i will therefore proceed i have proposed to you to marry not for your sake for indeed i did not think of you in the least at the moment you admire candor and will now be satisfied i hope but because it suited me to marry you as soon as possible on account of certain commercial speculations i am desirous of entering into eugnie became uneasy m it is just as i tell you i assure you and you must not be angry with me for you have sought this disclosure i do not willingly enter into arithmetical explanations
