with his mysterious tormentor and in waking speculations as to what the morrow would produce the next day must clear up every doubt and unless his near neighbor and would-be friend the count of monte cristo possessed the ring of gyges and by its power was able to render himself invisible it was very certain he could not escape this time eight oclock found franz up and dressed while albert who had not the same motives for early rising was still soundly asleep the first act of franz was to summon his landlord who presented himself with his accustomed obsequiousness pray signor pastrini asked franz is not some execution appointed to take place today yes your excellency but if your reason for inquiry is that you may procure a window to view it from you are much too late oh no answered franz i had no such intention and even if i had felt a wish to witness the spectacle i might have done so from monte pincio could i not ah exclaimed mine host i did not think it likely your excellency would have chosen to mingle with such a rabble as are always collected on that hill which indeed they consider as exclusively belonging to themselves very possibly i may not go answered franz but in case i feel disposed give me some particulars of todays executions what particulars would your excellency like to hear why the number of persons condemned to suffer their names and description of the death they are to die that happens just lucky your excellency only a few minutes ago they brought me the tavolettas what are they sort of wooden tablets hung up at the corners of streets the evening before an execution on which is pasted up a paper containing the names of the condemned persons their crimes and mode of punishment the reason for so publicly announcing all this is that all good and faithful catholics may offer up their prayers for the unfortunate culprits and above all beseech of heaven to grant them a sincere repentance and these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers to those of the faithful are they asked franz somewhat incredulously oh dear no your excellency i have not time for anybodys affairs but my own and those of my honorable guests but i make an agreement with the man who pastes up the papers and he brings them to me as he would the playbills that in case any person staying at my hotel should like to witness an execution he may obtain every requisite information concerning the time and place etc upon my word that is a most delicate attention on your part signor pastrini cried franz why your excellency returned the landlord chuckling and rubbing his hands with infinite complacency i think i may take upon myself to say i neglect nothing to deserve the support and patronage of the noble visitors to this poor hotel i see that plainly enough my most excellent host and you may rely upon me to proclaim so striking a proof of your attention to your guests wherever i go meanwhile oblige me by a sight of one of these tavolettas nothing can be easier than to comply with your excellencys wish said the landlord opening the door of the chamber i have caused one to be placed on the landing close by your apartment then taking the tablet from the wall he handed it to franz who read as follows the public is informed that on wednesday february rd being the first day of the carnival executions will take place in the piazza del popolo by order of the tribunal of the rota of two persons named andrea rondolo and peppino otherwise called rocca priori the former found guilty of the murder of a venerable and exemplary priest named don csar torlini canon of the church of st john lateran and the latter convicted of being an accomplice of the atrocious and sanguinary bandit luigi vampa and his band the first-named malefactor will be mazzolato the second culprit decapitato the prayers of all good christians are entreated for these unfortunate men that it may please god to awaken them to a sense of their guilt and to grant them a hearty and sincere repentance for their crimes this was precisely what franz had heard the evening before in the ruins of the colosseum no part of the programme differed the names of the condemned persons their crimes and mode of punishment all agreed with his previous information in all probability therefore the transteverin was no other than the bandit luigi vampa himself and the man shrouded in the mantle the same he had known as sinbad the sailor but who no doubt was still pursuing his philanthropic expedition in rome as he had already done at porto-vecchio and tunis time was getting on however and franz deemed it advisable to awaken albert but at the moment he prepared to proceed to his chamber his friend entered the room in perfect costume for the day the anticipated delights of the carnival had so run in his head as to make him leave his pillow long before his usual hour now my excellent signor pastrini said franz addressing his landlord since we are both ready do you think we may proceed at once to
