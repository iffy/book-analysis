purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of inferior birth sir walter had resented it as the head of the house he felt that he ought to have been consulted especially after taking the young man so publicly by the hand for they must have been seen together he observed once at tattersall's and twice in the lobby of the house of commons his disapprobation was expressed but apparently very little regarded mr elliot had attempted no apology and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family as sir walter considered him unworthy of it all acquaintance between them had ceased this very awkward history of mr elliot was still after an interval of several years felt with anger by elizabeth who had liked the man for himself and still more for being her father's heir and whose strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for sir walter elliot's eldest daughter there was not a baronet from a to z whom her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal yet so miserably had he conducted himself that though she was at this present time the summer of wearing black ribbons for his wife she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again the disgrace of his first marriage might perhaps as there was no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring have been got over had he not done worse but he had as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends they had been informed spoken most disrespectfully of them all most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to and the honours which were hereafter to be his own this could not be pardoned such were elizabeth elliot's sentiments and sensations such the cares to alloy the agitations to vary the sameness and the elegance the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life such the feelings to give interest to a long uneventful residence in one country circle to fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad no talents or accomplishments for home to occupy but now another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be added to these her father was growing distressed for money she knew that when he now took up the baronetage it was to drive the heavy bills of his tradespeople and the unwelcome hints of mr shepherd his agent from his thoughts the kellynch property was good but not equal to sir walter's apprehension of the state required in its possessor while lady elliot lived there had been method moderation and economy which had just kept him within his income but with her had died all such right-mindedness and from that period he had been constantly exceeding it it had not been possible for him to spend less he had done nothing but what sir walter elliot was imperiously called on to do but blameless as he was he was not only growing dreadfully in debt but was hearing of it so often that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer even partially from his daughter he had given her some hints of it the last spring in town he had gone so far even as to say can we retrench does it occur to you that there is any one article in which we can retrench and elizabeth to do her justice had in the first ardour of female alarm set seriously to think what could be done and had finally proposed these two branches of economy to cut off some unnecessary charities and to refrain from new furnishing the drawing-room to which expedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no present down to anne as had been the usual yearly custom but these measures however good in themselves were insufficient for the real extent of the evil the whole of which sir walter found himself obliged to confess to her soon afterwards elizabeth had nothing to propose of deeper efficacy she felt herself ill-used and unfortunate as did her father and they were neither of them able to devise any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne there was only a small part of his estate that sir walter could dispose of but had every acre been alienable it would have made no difference he had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power but he would never condescend to sell no he would never disgrace his name so far the kellynch estate should be transmitted whole and entire as he had received it their two confidential friends mr shepherd who lived in the neighbouring market town and lady russell were called to advise them and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and reduce their expenditure without involving the loss of any indulgence of taste or pride chapter mr shepherd a civil cautious lawyer who whatever might be his hold or his views on sir walter would rather have the disagreeable prompted by anybody else excused himself from offering the slightest hint and only
