you are very humble today remarked the governor you are not so always the other day for instance when you tried to kill the turnkey it is true sir and i beg his pardon for he has always been very good to me but i was mad and you are not so any longer no captivity has subdued me i have been here so long so long when were you arrested then asked the inspector the th of february at half-past two in the afternoon today is the th of july why it is but seventeen months only seventeen months replied dants oh you do not know what is seventeen months in prison seventeen ages rather especially to a man who like me had arrived at the summit of his ambition to a man who like me was on the point of marrying a woman he adored who saw an honorable career opened before him and who loses all in an instant who sees his prospects destroyed and is ignorant of the fate of his affianced wife and whether his aged father be still living seventeen months captivity to a sailor accustomed to the boundless ocean is a worse punishment than human crime ever merited have pity on me then and ask for me not intelligence but a trial not pardon but a verdict a trial sir i ask only for a trial that surely cannot be denied to one who is accused we shall see said the inspector then turning to the governor on my word the poor devil touches me you must show me the proofs against him certainly but you will find terrible charges monsieur continued dants i know it is not in your power to release me but you can plead for me you can have me tried and that is all i ask let me know my crime and the reason why i was condemned uncertainty is worse than all go on with the lights said the inspector monsieur cried dants i can tell by your voice you are touched with pity tell me at least to hope i cannot tell you that replied the inspector i can only promise to examine into your case oh i am free then i am saved who arrested you m villefort see him and hear what he says m villefort is no longer at marseilles he is now at toulouse i am no longer surprised at my detention murmured dants since my only protector is removed had m de villefort any cause of personal dislike to you none on the contrary he was very kind to me i can then rely on the notes he has left concerning you entirely that is well wait patiently then dants fell on his knees and prayed earnestly the door closed but this time a fresh inmate was left with dants hope m will you see the register at once asked the governor or proceed to the other cell let us visit them all said the inspector if i once went up those stairs i should never have the courage to come down again ah this one is not like the other and his madness is less affecting than this ones display of reason what is his folly he fancies he possesses an immense treasure the first year he offered government a million of francs for his release the second two the third three and so on progressively he is now in his fifth year of captivity he will ask to speak to you in private and offer you five millions how curious what is his name the abb faria no said the inspector it is here unlock the door antoine the turnkey obeyed and the inspector gazed curiously into the chamber of the mad abb as the prisoner was usually called in the centre of the cell in a circle traced with a fragment of plaster detached from the wall sat a man whose tattered garments scarcely covered him he was drawing in this circle geometrical lines and seemed as much absorbed in his problem as archimedes was when the soldier of marcellus slew him he did not move at the sound of the door and continued his calculations until the flash of the torches lighted up with an unwonted glare the sombre walls of his cell then raising his head he perceived with astonishment the number of persons present he hastily seized the coverlet of his bed and wrapped it round him what is it you want said the inspector i monsieur replied the abb with an air of surprise i want nothing you do not understand continued the inspector i am sent here by government to visit the prison and hear the requests of the prisoners oh that is different cried the abb and we shall understand each other i hope there now whispered the governor it is just as i told you monsieur continued the prisoner i am the abb faria born at rome i was for twenty years cardinal spadas secretary i was arrested why i know not toward the beginning of the year since then i have demanded my liberty from the italian and french government why from the french government because i was arrested at piombino and i presume that like milan and florence piombino has become the capital of some french department ah said the inspector
