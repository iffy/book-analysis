thought i did not mistake with your lasso you could stop an ox again ali repeated his affirmative gesture or a tiger ali bowed his head in token of assent a lion even ali sprung forwards imitating the action of one throwing the lasso then of a strangled lion i understand said monte cristo you wish to tell me you have hunted the lion ali smiled with triumphant pride as he signified that he had indeed both chased and captured many lions but do you believe you could arrest the progress of two horses rushing forwards with ungovernable fury the nubian smiled it is well said monte cristo then listen to me ere long a carriage will dash past here drawn by the pair of dappled gray horses you saw me with yesterday now at the risk of your own life you must manage to stop those horses before my door ali descended to the street and marked a straight line on the pavement immediately at the entrance of the house and then pointed out the line he had traced to the count who was watching him the count patted him gently on the shoulder his usual mode of praising ali who pleased and gratified with the commission assigned him walked calmly towards a projecting stone forming the angle of the street and house and seating himself thereon began to smoke his chibouque while monte cristo re-entered his dwelling perfectly assured of the success of his plan still as five oclock approached and the carriage was momentarily expected by the count the indication of more than common impatience and uneasiness might be observed in his manner he stationed himself in a room commanding a view of the street pacing the chamber with restless steps stopping merely to listen from time to time for the sound of approaching wheels then to cast an anxious glance on ali but the regularity with which the nubian puffed forth the smoke of his chibouque proved that he at least was wholly absorbed in the enjoyment of his favorite occupation suddenly a distant sound of rapidly advancing wheels was heard and almost immediately a carriage appeared drawn by a pair of wild ungovernable horses while the terrified coachman strove in vain to restrain their furious speed in the vehicle was a young woman and a child of about seven or eight clasped in each others arms terror seemed to have deprived them even of the power of uttering a cry the carriage creaked and rattled as it flew over the rough stones and the slightest obstacle under the wheels would have caused disaster but it kept on in the middle of the road and those who saw it pass uttered cries of terror ali suddenly cast aside his chibouque drew the lasso from his pocket threw it so skilfully as to catch the forelegs of the near horse in its triple fold and suffered himself to be dragged on for a few steps by the violence of the shock then the animal fell over on the pole which snapped and therefore prevented the other horse from pursuing its way gladly availing himself of this opportunity the coachman leaped from his box but ali had promptly seized the nostrils of the second horse and held them in his iron grasp till the beast snorting with pain sunk beside his companion all this was achieved in much less time than is occupied in the recital the brief space had however been sufficient for a man followed by a number of servants to rush from the house before which the accident had occurred and as the coachman opened the door of the carriage to take from it a lady who was convulsively grasping the cushions with one hand while with the other she pressed to her bosom the young boy who had lost consciousness monte cristo carried them both to the salon and deposited them on a sofa compose yourself madame said he all danger is over the woman looked up at these words and with a glance far more expressive than any entreaties could have been pointed to her child who still continued insensible i understand the nature of your alarms madame said the count carefully examining the child but i assure you there is not the slightest occasion for uneasiness your little charge has not received the least injury his insensibility is merely the effects of terror and will soon pass are you quite sure you do not say so to tranquillize my fears see how deadly pale he is my child my darling edward speak to your mother open your dear eyes and look on me once again oh sir in pity send for a physician my whole fortune shall not be thought too much for the recovery of my boy with a calm smile and a gentle wave of the hand monte cristo signed to the distracted mother to lay aside her apprehensions then opening a casket that stood near he drew forth a phial of bohemian glass incrusted with gold containing a liquid of the color of blood of which he let fall a single drop on the childs lips scarcely had it reached them ere the boy though still pale as marble opened his eyes and eagerly gazed around him at this the delight of the mother was almost frantic where am i exclaimed
