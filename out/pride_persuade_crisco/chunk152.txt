same brother must still be in question she could not however reach such a degree of certainty as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject at the other house where the crofts had previously been calling the folks of the great house were to spend the evening of this day at the cottage and it being now too late in the year for such visits to be made on foot the coach was beginning to be listened for when the youngest miss musgrove walked in that she was coming to apologize and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves was the first black idea and mary was quite ready to be affronted when louisa made all right by saying that she only came on foot to leave more room for the harp which was bringing in the carriage and i will tell you our reason she added and all about it i am come on to give you notice that papa and mamma are out of spirits this evening especially mamma she is thinking so much of poor richard and we agreed it would be best to have the harp for it seems to amuse her more than the piano-forte i will tell you why she is out of spirits when the crofts called this morning they called here afterwards did not they they happened to say that her brother captain wentworth is just returned to england or paid off or something and is coming to see them almost directly and most unluckily it came into mammas head when they were gone that wentworth or something very like it was the name of poor richards captain at one time i do not know when or where but a great while before he died poor fellow and upon looking over his letters and things she found it was so and is perfectly sure that this must be the very man and her head is quite full of it and of poor richard so we must be as merry as we can that she may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things the real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were that the musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome hopeless son and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his twentieth year that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid and unmanageable on shore that he had been very little cared for at any time by his family though quite as much as he deserved seldom heard of and scarcely at all regretted when the intelligence of his death abroad had worked its way to uppercross two years before he had in fact though his sisters were now doing all they could for him by calling him poor richard been nothing better than a thick-headed unfeeling unprofitable dick musgrove who had never done anything to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name living or dead he had been several years at sea and had in the course of those removals to which all midshipmen are liable and especially such midshipmen as every captain wishes to get rid of been six months on board captain frederick wentworths frigate the laconia and from the laconia he had under the influence of his captain written the only two letters which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole of his absence that is to say the only two disinterested letters all the rest had been mere applications for money in each letter he had spoken well of his captain but yet so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships that it had made scarcely any impression at the time and that mrs musgrove should have been suddenly struck this very day with a recollection of the name of wentworth as connected with her son seemed one of those extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur she had gone to her letters and found it all as she supposed and the re-perusal of these letters after so long an interval her poor son gone for ever and all the strength of his faults forgotten had affected her spirits exceedingly and thrown her into greater grief for him than she had known on first hearing of his death mr musgrove was in a lesser degree affected likewise and when they reached the cottage they were evidently in want first of being listened to anew on this subject and afterwards of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them to hear them talking so much of captain wentworth repeating his name so often puzzling over past years and at last ascertaining that it might that it probably would turn out to be the very same captain wentworth whom they recollected meeting once or twice after their coming back from clifton--a very fine young man--but they could not say whether it was seven or eight years ago was a new sort of trial to annes nerves she found however that it was one to which she must inure herself since he actually was expected in the country she must teach herself to be insensible on such points and not only did it appear
