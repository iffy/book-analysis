absurd for a few minutes she saw nothing before her it was all confusion she was lost and when she had scolded back her senses she found the others still waiting for the carriage and mr elliot always obliging just setting off for union street on a commission of mrs clay's she now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door she wanted to see if it rained why was she to suspect herself of another motive captain wentworth must be out of sight she left her seat she would go one half of her should not be always so much wiser than the other half or always suspecting the other of being worse than it was she would see if it rained she was sent back however in a moment by the entrance of captain wentworth himself among a party of gentlemen and ladies evidently his acquaintance and whom he must have joined a little below milsom street he was more obviously struck and confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before he looked quite red for the first time since their renewed acquaintance she felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two she had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments all the overpowering blinding bewildering first effects of strong surprise were over with her still however she had enough to feel it was agitation pain pleasure a something between delight and misery he spoke to her and then turned away the character of his manner was embarrassment she could not have called it either cold or friendly or anything so certainly as embarrassed after a short interval however he came towards her and spoke again mutual enquiries on common subjects passed neither of them probably much the wiser for what they heard and anne continuing fully sensible of his being less at ease than formerly they had by dint of being so very much together got to speak to each other with a considerable portion of apparent indifference and calmness but he could not do it now time had changed him or louisa had changed him there was consciousness of some sort or other he looked very well not as if he had been suffering in health or spirits and he talked of uppercross of the musgroves nay even of louisa and had even a momentary look of his own arch significance as he named her but yet it was captain wentworth not comfortable not easy not able to feign that he was it did not surprise but it grieved anne to observe that elizabeth would not know him she saw that he saw elizabeth that elizabeth saw him that there was complete internal recognition on each side she was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance expecting it and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away with unalterable coldness lady dalrymple's carriage for which miss elliot was growing very impatient now drew up the servant came in to announce it it was beginning to rain again and altogether there was a delay and a bustle and a talking which must make all the little crowd in the shop understand that lady dalrymple was calling to convey miss elliot at last miss elliot and her friend unattended but by the servant for there was no cousin returned were walking off and captain wentworth watching them turned again to anne and by manner rather than words was offering his services to her i am much obliged to you was her answer but i am not going with them the carriage would not accommodate so many i walk i prefer walking but it rains oh very little nothing that i regard after a moment's pause he said though i came only yesterday i have equipped myself properly for bath already you see pointing to a new umbrella i wish you would make use of it if you are determined to walk though i think it would be more prudent to let me get you a chair she was very much obliged to him but declined it all repeating her conviction that the rain would come to nothing at present and adding i am only waiting for mr elliot he will be here in a moment i am sure she had hardly spoken the words when mr elliot walked in captain wentworth recollected him perfectly there was no difference between him and the man who had stood on the steps at lyme admiring anne as she passed except in the air and look and manner of the privileged relation and friend he came in with eagerness appeared to see and think only of her apologised for his stay was grieved to have kept her waiting and anxious to get her away without further loss of time and before the rain increased and in another moment they walked off together her arm under his a gentle and embarrassed glance and a good morning to you being all that she had time for as she passed away as soon as they were out of sight the ladies of captain wentworth's party began talking of them mr elliot does not dislike his cousin i fancy oh no that is clear enough one can guess what will happen there he is always with them half
