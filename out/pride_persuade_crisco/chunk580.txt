short let us either understand each other or quarrel you understand no more delay yes sir i will give my attention to the subject i do not say that i await with pleasure his decision but i do await it a banker must you know be a slave to his promise and danglars sighed as m cavalcanti had done half an hour before bravi bravo brava cried morcerf parodying the banker as the selection came to an end danglars began to look suspiciously at morcerf when someone came and whispered a few words to him i shall soon return said the banker to monte cristo wait for me i shall perhaps have something to say to you and he went out the baroness took advantage of her husbands absence to push open the door of her daughters study and m andrea who was sitting before the piano with mademoiselle eugnie started up like a jack-in-the-box albert bowed with a smile to mademoiselle danglars who did not appear in the least disturbed and returned his bow with her usual coolness cavalcanti was evidently embarrassed he bowed to morcerf who replied with the most impertinent look possible then albert launched out in praise of mademoiselle danglars voice and on his regret after what he had just heard that he had been unable to be present the previous evening cavalcanti being left alone turned to monte cristo come said madame danglars leave music and compliments and let us go and take tea come louise said mademoiselle danglars to her friend they passed into the next drawing-room where tea was prepared just as they were beginning in the english fashion to leave the spoons in their cups the door again opened and danglars entered visibly agitated monte cristo observed it particularly and by a look asked the banker for an explanation i have just received my courier from greece said danglars ah yes said the count that was the reason of your running away from us yes how is king otho getting on asked albert in the most sprightly tone danglars cast another suspicious look towards him without answering and monte cristo turned away to conceal the expression of pity which passed over his features but which was gone in a moment we shall go together shall we not said albert to the count if you like replied the latter albert could not understand the bankers look and turning to monte cristo who understood it perfectly did you see said he how he looked at me yes said the count but did you think there was anything particular in his look indeed i did and what does he mean by his news from greece how can i tell you because i imagine you have correspondents in that country monte cristo smiled significantly stop said albert here he comes i shall compliment mademoiselle danglars on her cameo while the father talks to you if you compliment her at all let it be on her voice at least said monte cristo no everyone would do that my dear viscount you are dreadfully impertinent albert advanced towards eugnie smiling meanwhile danglars stooping to monte cristos ear your advice was excellent said he there is a whole history connected with the names fernand and yanina indeed said monte cristo yes i will tell you all but take away the young man i cannot endure his presence he is going with me shall i send the father to you immediately very well the count made a sign to albert and they bowed to the ladies and took their leave albert perfectly indifferent to mademoiselle danglars contempt monte cristo reiterating his advice to madame danglars on the prudence a bankers wife should exercise in providing for the future m cavalcanti remained master of the field chapter hayde scarcely had the counts horses cleared the angle of the boulevard when albert turning towards the count burst into a loud fit of laughter much too loud in fact not to give the idea of its being rather forced and unnatural well said he i will ask you the same question which charles ix put to catherine de medici after the massacre of saint bartholomew how have i played my little part to what do you allude asked monte cristo to the installation of my rival at m danglars what rival ma foi what rival why your protg m andrea cavalcanti ah no joking viscount if you please i do not patronize m andrea at least not as concerns m danglars and you would be to blame for not assisting him if the young man really needed your help in that quarter but happily for me he can dispense with it what do you think he is paying his addresses i am certain of it his languishing looks and modulated tones when addressing mademoiselle danglars fully proclaim his intentions he aspires to the hand of the proud eugnie what does that signify so long as they favor your suit but it is not the case my dear count on the contrary i am repulsed on all sides what it is so indeed mademoiselle eugnie scarcely answers me and mademoiselle darmilly her confidant does not speak to me at all but the father has the greatest regard possible for you said monte cristo he oh no he has plunged a thousand daggers into my heart tragedy-weapons
