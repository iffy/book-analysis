the passage to listen at a door and maximilian and emmanuel who had considerately passed forward a few steps thought they heard him answer by a sigh to a sob from within as the clock struck eight they drove up to the place of meeting we are first said morrel looking out of the window excuse me sir said baptistin who had followed his master with indescribable terror but i think i see a carriage down there under the trees monte cristo sprang lightly from the carriage and offered his hand to assist emmanuel and maximilian the latter retained the counts hand between his i like said he to feel a hand like this when its owner relies on the goodness of his cause it seems to me said emmanuel that i see two young men down there who are evidently waiting monte cristo drew morrel a step or two behind his brother-in-law maximilian said he are your affections disengaged morrel looked at monte cristo with astonishment i do not seek your confidence my dear friend i only ask you a simple question answer it that is all i require i love a young girl count do you love her much more than my life another hope defeated said the count then with a sigh poor hayde murmured he to tell the truth count if i knew less of you i should think that you were less brave than you are because i sigh when thinking of someone i am leaving come morrel it is not like a soldier to be so bad a judge of courage do i regret life what is it to me who have passed twenty years between life and death moreover do not alarm yourself morrel this weakness if it is such is betrayed to you alone i know the world is a drawing-room from which we must retire politely and honestly that is with a bow and our debts of honor paid that is to the purpose have you brought your arms i what for i hope these gentlemen have theirs i will inquire said morrel do but make no treaty you understand me you need not fear morrel advanced towards beauchamp and chteau-renaud who seeing his intention came to meet him the three young men bowed to each other courteously if not affably excuse me gentlemen said morrel but i do not see m de morcerf he sent us word this morning replied chteau-renaud that he would meet us on the ground ah said morrel beauchamp pulled out his watch it is only five minutes past eight said he to morrel there is not much time lost yet oh i made no allusion of that kind replied morrel there is a carriage coming said chteau-renaud it advanced rapidly along one of the avenues leading towards the open space where they were assembled you are doubtless provided with pistols gentlemen m de monte cristo yields his right of using his we had anticipated this kindness on the part of the count said beauchamp and i have brought some weapons which i bought eight or ten days since thinking to want them on a similar occasion they are quite new and have not yet been used will you examine them oh m beauchamp if you assure me that m de morcerf does not know these pistols you may readily believe that your word will be quite sufficient gentlemen said chteau-renaud it is not morcerf coming in that carriage faith it is franz and debray the two young men he announced were indeed approaching what chance brings you here gentlemen said chteau-renaud shaking hands with each of them because said debray albert sent this morning to request us to come beauchamp and chteau-renaud exchanged looks of astonishment i think i understand his reason said morrel what is it yesterday afternoon i received a letter from m de morcerf begging me to attend the opera and i said debray and i also said franz and we too added beauchamp and chteau-renaud having wished you all to witness the challenge he now wishes you to be present at the combat exactly so said the young men you have probably guessed right but after all these arrangements he does not come himself said chteau-renaud albert is ten minutes after time there he comes said beauchamp on horseback at full gallop followed by a servant how imprudent said chteau-renaud to come on horseback to fight a duel with pistols after all the instructions i had given him and besides said beauchamp with a collar above his cravat an open coat and white waistcoat why has he not painted a spot upon his heart it would have been more simple meanwhile albert had arrived within ten paces of the group formed by the five young men he jumped from his horse threw the bridle on his servants arms and joined them he was pale and his eyes were red and swollen it was evident that he had not slept a shade of melancholy gravity overspread his countenance which was not natural to him i thank you gentlemen said he for having complied with my request i feel extremely grateful for this mark of friendship morrel had stepped back as morcerf approached and remained at a short distance and to you also m morrel my thanks are due come there cannot be too many
