adopted the expedient of telling her briefly what she thought of the attachment between him and louisa when this was told his name distressed her no longer lady russell had only to listen composedly and wish them happy but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure in pleased contempt that the man who at twenty-three had seemed to understand somewhat of the value of an anne elliot should eight years afterwards be charmed by a louisa musgrove the first three or four days passed most quietly with no circumstance to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from lyme which found their way to anne she could not tell how and brought a rather improving account of louisa at the end of that period lady russells politeness could repose no longer and the fainter self-threatenings of the past became in a decided tone i must call on mrs croft i really must call upon her soon anne have you courage to go with me and pay a visit in that house it will be some trial to us both anne did not shrink from it on the contrary she truly felt as she said in observing i think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine by remaining in the neighbourhood i am become inured to it she could have said more on the subject for she had in fact so high an opinion of the crofts and considered her father so very fortunate in his tenants felt the parish to be so sure of a good example and the poor of the best attention and relief that however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal she could not but in conscience feel that they were gone who deserved not to stay and that kellynch hall had passed into better hands than its owners these convictions must unquestionably have their own pain and severe was its kind but they precluded that pain which lady russell would suffer in entering the house again and returning through the well-known apartments in such moments anne had no power of saying to herself these rooms ought to belong only to us oh how fallen in their destination how unworthily occupied an ancient family to be so driven away strangers filling their place no except when she thought of her mother and remembered where she had been used to sit and preside she had no sigh of that description to heave mrs croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure of fancying herself a favourite and on the present occasion receiving her in that house there was particular attention the sad accident at lyme was soon the prevailing topic and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid it appeared that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn that captain wentworth had been in kellynch yesterday the first time since the accident had brought anne the last note which she had not been able to trace the exact steps of had staid a few hours and then returned again to lyme and without any present intention of quitting it any more he had enquired after her she found particularly had expressed his hope of miss elliots not being the worse for her exertions and had spoken of those exertions as great this was handsome and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could have done as to the sad catastrophe itself it could be canvassed only in one style by a couple of steady sensible women whose judgements had to work on ascertained events and it was perfectly decided that it had been the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence that its effects were most alarming and that it was frightful to think how long miss musgroves recovery might yet be doubtful and how liable she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter the admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming ay a very bad business indeed a new sort of way this for a young fellow to be making love by breaking his mistresss head is not it miss elliot this is breaking a head and giving a plaster truly admiral crofts manners were not quite of the tone to suit lady russell but they delighted anne his goodness of heart and simplicity of character were irresistible now this must be very bad for you said he suddenly rousing from a little reverie to be coming and finding us here i had not recollected it before i declare but it must be very bad but now do not stand upon ceremony get up and go over all the rooms in the house if you like it another time sir i thank you not now well whenever it suits you you can slip in from the shrubbery at any time and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up by that door a good place is not it but checking himself you will not think it a good place for yours were always kept in the butlers room ay so it always is i believe one mans ways may be as good as anothers but we all like our own best and so you must judge for yourself whether it would be better for you
