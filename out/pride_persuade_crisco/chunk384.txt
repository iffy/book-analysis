hit upon a most capital idea and quite a national one too replied albert with gratified pride a mere masque borrowed from our own festivities ha ha ye romans you thought to make us unhappy strangers trot at the heels of your processions like so many lazzaroni because no carriages or horses are to be had in your beggarly city but you dont know us when we cant have one thing we invent another and have you communicated your triumphant idea to anybody only to our host upon my return home i sent for him and i then explained to him what i wished to procure he assured me that nothing would be easier than to furnish all i desired one thing i was sorry for when i bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded he told me there would not be time as it would require three days to do that so you see we must do without this little superfluity and where is he now who our host gone out in search of our equipage by tomorrow it might be too late then he will be able to give us an answer tonight oh i expect him every minute at this instant the door opened and the head of signor pastrini appeared permesso inquired he certainly certainly cried franz come in my host now then asked albert eagerly have you found the desired cart and oxen better than that replied signor pastrini with the air of a man perfectly well satisfied with himself take care my worthy host said albert better is a sure enemy to well let your excellencies only leave the matter to me returned signor pastrini in a tone indicative of unbounded self-confidence but what have you done asked franz speak out theres a worthy fellow your excellencies are aware responded the landlord swelling with importance that the count of monte cristo is living on the same floor with yourselves i should think we did know it exclaimed albert since it is owing to that circumstance that we are packed into these small rooms like two poor students in the back streets of paris when then the count of monte cristo hearing of the dilemma in which you are placed has sent to offer you seats in his carriage and two places at his windows in the palazzo rospoli the friends looked at each other with unutterable surprise but do you think asked albert that we ought to accept such offers from a perfect stranger what sort of person is this count of monte cristo asked franz of his host a very great nobleman but whether maltese or sicilian i cannot exactly say but this i know that he is noble as a borghese and rich as a gold mine it seems to me said franz speaking in an undertone to albert that if this person merited the high panegyrics of our landlord he would have conveyed his invitation through another channel and not permitted it to be brought to us in this unceremonious way he would have written or at this instant someone knocked at the door come in said franz a servant wearing a livery of considerable style and richness appeared at the threshold and placing two cards in the landlords hands who forthwith presented them to the two young men he said please to deliver these from the count of monte cristo to vicomte albert de morcerf and m franz dpinay the count of monte cristo continued the servant begs these gentlemens permission to wait upon them as their neighbor and he will be honored by an intimation of what time they will please to receive him faith franz whispered albert there is not much to find fault with here tell the count replied franz that we will do ourselves the pleasure of calling on him the servant bowed and retired that is what i call an elegant mode of attack said albert you were quite correct in what you said signor pastrini the count of monte cristo is unquestionably a man of first-rate breeding and knowledge of the world then you accept his offer said the host of course we do replied albert still i must own i am sorry to be obliged to give up the cart and the group of reapers it would have produced such an effect and were it not for the windows at the palazzo rospoli by way of recompense for the loss of our beautiful scheme i dont know but what i should have held on by my original plan what say you franz oh i agree with you the windows in the palazzo rospoli alone decided me the truth was that the mention of two places in the palazzo rospoli had recalled to franz the conversation he had overheard the preceding evening in the ruins of the colosseum between the mysterious unknown and the transteverin in which the stranger in the cloak had undertaken to obtain the freedom of a condemned criminal and if this muffled-up individual proved as franz felt sure he would the same as the person he had just seen in the teatro argentina then he should be able to establish his identity and also to prosecute his researches respecting him with perfect facility and freedom franz passed the night in confused dreams respecting the two meetings he had already had
