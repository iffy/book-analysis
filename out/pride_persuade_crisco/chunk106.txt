concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law and he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could when first mr bennet had married economy was held to be perfectly useless for of course they were to have a son the son was to join in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for five daughters successively entered the world but yet the son was to come and mrs bennet for many years after lydias birth had been certain that he would this event had at last been despaired of but it was then too late to be saving mrs bennet had no turn for economy and her husbands love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs bennet and the children but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents this was one point with regard to lydia at least which was now to be settled and mr bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him he had never before supposed that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them for what with her board and pocket allowance and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mothers hands lydias expenses had been very little within that sum that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was another very welcome surprise for his wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over he naturally returned to all his former indolence his letter was soon dispatched for though dilatory in undertaking business he was quick in its execution he begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her the good news spread quickly through the house and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as the happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant farmhouse but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her misery was considered certain it was a fortnight since mrs bennet had been downstairs but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in spirits oppressively high no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point of accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials fine muslins new carriages and servants she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and importance haye park might do said she if the gouldings could quit it or the great house at stoke if the drawing-room were larger but ashworth is too far off i could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as for pulvis lodge the attics are dreadful her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained but when they had withdrawn he said to her mrs bennet before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter let us come to a right understanding into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance i will not encourage the impudence of either by receiving them at longbourn a long dispute followed this declaration but mr bennet was firm it soon led to another and mrs bennet found with amazement and horror that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion mrs bennet could hardly comprehend it that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid exceeded all she could believe possible she was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must reflect
