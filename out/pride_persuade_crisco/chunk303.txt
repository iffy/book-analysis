adieu adieu murmured the old man clasping edmonds hand convulsively adieu oh no no not yet he cried do not forsake me oh succor him help help help hush hush murmured the dying man that they may not separate us if you save me you are right oh yes yes be assured i shall save you besides although you suffer much you do not seem to be in such agony as you were before do not mistake i suffer less because there is in me less strength to endure at your age we have faith in life it is the privilege of youth to believe and hope but old men see death more clearly oh tis here tis here tis over my sight is gone my senses fail your hand dants adieu adieu and raising himself by a final effort in which he summoned all his faculties he said monte cristo forget not monte cristo and he fell back on the bed the crisis was terrible and a rigid form with twisted limbs swollen eyelids and lips flecked with bloody foam lay on the bed of torture in place of the intellectual being who so lately rested there dants took the lamp placed it on a projecting stone above the bed whence its tremulous light fell with strange and fantastic ray on the distorted countenance and motionless stiffened body with steady gaze he awaited confidently the moment for administering the restorative when he believed that the right moment had arrived he took the knife pried open the teeth which offered less resistance than before counted one after the other twelve drops and watched the phial contained perhaps twice as much more he waited ten minutes a quarter of an hour half an hour no change took place trembling his hair erect his brow bathed with perspiration he counted the seconds by the beating of his heart then he thought it was time to make the last trial and he put the phial to the purple lips of faria and without having occasion to force open his jaws which had remained extended he poured the whole of the liquid down his throat m the draught produced a galvanic effect a violent trembling pervaded the old mans limbs his eyes opened until it was fearful to gaze upon them he heaved a sigh which resembled a shriek and then his convulsed body returned gradually to its former immobility the eyes remaining open half an hour an hour an hour and a half elapsed and during this period of anguish edmond leaned over his friend his hand applied to his heart and felt the body gradually grow cold and the hearts pulsation become more and more deep and dull until at length it stopped the last movement of the heart ceased the face became livid the eyes remained open but the eyeballs were glazed it was six oclock in the morning the dawn was just breaking and its feeble ray came into the dungeon and paled the ineffectual light of the lamp strange shadows passed over the countenance of the dead man and at times gave it the appearance of life while the struggle between day and night lasted dants still doubted but as soon as the daylight gained the pre-eminence he saw that he was alone with a corpse then an invincible and extreme terror seized upon him and he dared not again press the hand that hung out of bed he dared no longer to gaze on those fixed and vacant eyes which he tried many times to close but in vain they opened again as soon as shut he extinguished the lamp carefully concealed it and then went away closing as well as he could the entrance to the secret passage by the large stone as he descended it was time for the jailer was coming on this occasion he began his rounds at dants cell and on leaving him he went on to farias dungeon taking thither breakfast and some linen nothing betokened that the man knew anything of what had occurred he went on his way dants was then seized with an indescribable desire to know what was going on in the dungeon of his unfortunate friend he therefore returned by the subterraneous gallery and arrived in time to hear the exclamations of the turnkey who called out for help other turnkeys came and then was heard the regular tramp of soldiers last of all came the governor edmond heard the creaking of the bed as they moved the corpse heard the voice of the governor who asked them to throw water on the dead mans face and seeing that in spite of this application the prisoner did not recover they sent for the doctor the governor then went out and words of pity fell on dants listening ears mingled with brutal laughter well well said one the madman has gone to look after his treasure good journey to him with all his millions he will not have enough to pay for his shroud said another oh added a third voice the shrouds of the chteau dif are not dear m perhaps said one of the previous speakers as he was a churchman they may go to some expense in his behalf they may give him the honors of the sack edmond did not lose a word but comprehended very
