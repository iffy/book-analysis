of strong emotion enables them to see distinctly and which afterwards fails from being too much taxed before we are alarmed we see correctly when we are alarmed we see double and when we have been alarmed we see nothing but trouble danglars observed a man in a cloak galloping at the right hand of the carriage some gendarme he exclaimed can i have been intercepted by french telegrams to the pontifical authorities he resolved to end his anxiety where are you taking me he asked dentro la testa replied the same voice with the same menacing accent danglars turned to the left another man on horseback was galloping on that side decidedly said danglars with the perspiration on his forehead i must be under arrest and he threw himself back in the calash not this time to sleep but to think directly afterwards the moon rose he then saw the great aqueducts those stone phantoms which he had before remarked only then they were on the right hand now they were on the left he understood that they had described a circle and were bringing him back to rome oh unfortunate he cried they must have obtained my arrest the carriage continued to roll on with frightful speed an hour of terror elapsed for every spot they passed showed that they were on the road back at length he saw a dark mass against which it seemed as if the carriage was about to dash but the vehicle turned to one side leaving the barrier behind and danglars saw that it was one of the ramparts encircling rome m mon dieu cried danglars we are not returning to rome then it is not justice which is pursuing me gracious heavens another idea presents itself what if they should be his hair stood on end he remembered those interesting stories so little believed in paris respecting roman bandits he remembered the adventures that albert de morcerf had related when it was intended that he should marry mademoiselle eugnie they are robbers perhaps he muttered just then the carriage rolled on something harder than gravel road danglars hazarded a look on both sides of the road and perceived monuments of a singular form and his mind now recalled all the details morcerf had related and comparing them with his own situation he felt sure that he must be on the appian way on the left in a sort of valley he perceived a circular excavation it was caracallas circus on a word from the man who rode at the side of the carriage it stopped at the same time the door was opened scendi exclaimed a commanding voice danglars instantly descended although he did not yet speak italian he understood it very well more dead than alive he looked around him four men surrounded him besides the postilion di qu said one of the men descending a little path leading out of the appian way danglars followed his guide without opposition and had no occasion to turn around to see whether the three others were following him still it appeared as though they were stationed at equal distances from one another like sentinels after walking for about ten minutes during which danglars did not exchange a single word with his guide he found himself between a hillock and a clump of high weeds three men standing silent formed a triangle of which he was the centre he wished to speak but his tongue refused to move avanti said the same sharp and imperative voice this time danglars had double reason to understand for if the word and gesture had not explained the speakers meaning it was clearly expressed by the man walking behind him who pushed him so rudely that he struck against the guide this guide was our friend peppino who dashed into the thicket of high weeds through a path which none but lizards or polecats could have imagined to be an open road peppino stopped before a rock overhung by thick hedges the rock half open afforded a passage to the young man who disappeared like the evil spirits in the fairy tales the voice and gesture of the man who followed danglars ordered him to do the same there was no longer any doubt the bankrupt was in the hands of roman banditti danglars acquitted himself like a man placed between two dangerous positions and who is rendered brave by fear notwithstanding his large stomach certainly not intended to penetrate the fissures of the campagna he slid down like peppino and closing his eyes fell upon his feet as he touched the ground he opened his eyes m the path was wide but dark peppino who cared little for being recognized now that he was in his own territories struck a light and lit a torch two other men descended after danglars forming the rearguard and pushing danglars whenever he happened to stop they came by a gentle declivity to the intersection of two corridors the walls were hollowed out in sepulchres one above the other and which seemed in contrast with the white stones to open their large dark eyes like those which we see on the faces of the dead a sentinel struck the rings of his carbine against his left hand who comes there he cried a friend a friend said peppino but where is the
