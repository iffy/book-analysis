for his journey as a reward for the majestic and solemn manner in which he had maintained his assumed character of father m andrea at his departure inherited all the papers which proved that he had indeed the honor of being the son of the marquis bartolomeo and the marchioness oliva corsinari he was now fairly launched in that parisian society which gives such ready access to foreigners and treats them not as they really are but as they wish to be considered besides what is required of a young man in paris to speak its language tolerably to make a good appearance to be a good gamester and to pay in cash they are certainly less particular with a foreigner than with a frenchman andrea had then in a fortnight attained a very fair position he was called count he was said to possess livres per annum and his fathers immense riches buried in the quarries of saravezza were a constant theme a learned man before whom the last circumstance was mentioned as a fact declared he had seen the quarries in question which gave great weight to assertions hitherto somewhat doubtful but which now assumed the garb of reality such was the state of society in paris at the period we bring before our readers when monte cristo went one evening to pay m danglars a visit m danglars was out but the count was asked to go and see the baroness and he accepted the invitation it was never without a nervous shudder since the dinner at auteuil and the events which followed it that madame danglars heard monte cristos name announced if he did not come the painful sensation became most intense if on the contrary he appeared his noble countenance his brilliant eyes his amiability his polite attention even towards madame danglars soon dispelled every impression of fear it appeared impossible to the baroness that a man of such delightfully pleasing manners should entertain evil designs against her besides the most corrupt minds only suspect evil when it would answer some interested end useless injury is repugnant to every mind m when monte cristo entered the boudoir to which we have already once introduced our readers and where the baroness was examining some drawings which her daughter passed to her after having looked at them with m cavalcanti his presence soon produced its usual effect and it was with smiles that the baroness received the count although she had been a little disconcerted at the announcement of his name the latter took in the whole scene at a glance the baroness was partially reclining on a sofa eugnie sat near her and cavalcanti was standing cavalcanti dressed in black like one of goethes heroes with varnished shoes and white silk open-worked stockings passed a white and tolerably nice-looking hand through his light hair and so displayed a sparkling diamond that in spite of monte cristos advice the vain young man had been unable to resist putting on his little finger this movement was accompanied by killing glances at mademoiselle danglars and by sighs launched in the same direction mademoiselle danglars was still the same cold beautiful and satirical not one of these glances nor one sigh was lost on her they might have been said to fall on the shield of minerva which some philosophers assert protected sometimes the breast of sappho eugnie bowed coldly to the count and availed herself of the first moment when the conversation became earnest to escape to her study whence very soon two cheerful and noisy voices being heard in connection with occasional notes of the piano assured monte cristo that mademoiselle danglars preferred to his society and to that of m cavalcanti the company of mademoiselle louise darmilly her singing teacher it was then especially while conversing with madame danglars and apparently absorbed by the charm of the conversation that the count noticed m andrea cavalcantis solicitude his manner of listening to the music at the door he dared not pass and of manifesting his admiration the banker soon returned his first look was certainly directed towards monte cristo but the second was for andrea as for his wife he bowed to her as some husbands do to their wives but in a way that bachelors will never comprehend until a very extensive code is published on conjugal life have not the ladies invited you to join them at the piano said danglars to andrea alas no sir replied andrea with a sigh still more remarkable than the former ones danglars immediately advanced towards the door and opened it m the two young ladies were seen seated on the same chair at the piano accompanying themselves each with one hand a fancy to which they had accustomed themselves and performed admirably mademoiselle darmilly whom they then perceived through the open doorway formed with eugnie one of the tableaux vivants of which the germans are so fond she was somewhat beautiful and exquisitely formed a little fairy-like figure with large curls falling on her neck which was rather too long as
