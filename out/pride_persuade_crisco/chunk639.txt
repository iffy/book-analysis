folly folly folly to carry generosity so far as to put myself up as a mark for that young man to aim at he will never believe that my death was suicide and yet it is important for the honor of my memory and this surely is not vanity but a justifiable pride it is important the world should know that i have consented by my free will to stop my arm already raised to strike and that with the arm which has been so powerful against others i have struck myself it must be it shall be seizing a pen he drew a paper from a secret drawer in his desk and wrote at the bottom of the document which was no other than his will made since his arrival in paris a sort of codicil clearly explaining the nature of his death i do this oh my god said he with his eyes raised to heaven as much for thy honor as for mine i have during ten years considered myself the agent of thy vengeance and other wretches like morcerf danglars villefort even morcerf himself must not imagine that chance has freed them from their enemy let them know on the contrary that their punishment which had been decreed by providence is only delayed by my present determination and although they escape it in this world it awaits them in another and that they are only exchanging time for eternity while he was thus agitated by gloomy uncertainties wretched waking dreams of grief the first rays of morning pierced his windows and shone upon the pale blue paper on which he had just inscribed his justification of providence it was just five oclock in the morning when a slight noise like a stifled sigh reached his ear he turned his head looked around him and saw no one but the sound was repeated distinctly enough to convince him of its reality he arose and quietly opening the door of the drawing-room saw hayde who had fallen on a chair with her arms hanging down and her beautiful head thrown back she had been standing at the door to prevent his going out without seeing her until sleep which the young cannot resist had overpowered her frame wearied as she was with watching the noise of the door did not awaken her and monte cristo gazed at her with affectionate regret she remembered that she had a son said he and i forgot i had a daughter then shaking his head sorrowfully poor hayde said he she wished to see me to speak to me she has feared or guessed something oh i cannot go without taking leave of her i cannot die without confiding her to someone he quietly regained his seat and wrote under the other lines i bequeath to maximilian morrel captain of spahis and son of my former patron pierre morrel shipowner at marseilles the sum of twenty millions a part of which may be offered to his sister julie and brother-in-law emmanuel if he does not fear this increase of fortune may mar their happiness these twenty millions are concealed in my grotto at monte cristo of which bertuccio knows the secret if his heart is free and he will marry hayde the daughter of ali pasha of yanina whom i have brought up with the love of a father and who has shown the love and tenderness of a daughter for me he will thus accomplish my last wish this will has already constituted hayde heiress of the rest of my fortune consisting of lands funds in england austria and holland furniture in my different palaces and houses and which without the twenty millions and the legacies to my servants may still amount to sixty millions m he was finishing the last line when a cry behind him made him start and the pen fell from his hand hayde said he did you read it oh my lord said she why are you writing thus at such an hour why are you bequeathing all your fortune to me are you going to leave me i am going on a journey dear child said monte cristo with an expression of infinite tenderness and melancholy and if any misfortune should happen to me the count stopped well asked the young girl with an authoritative tone the count had never observed before and which startled him well if any misfortune happen to me replied monte cristo i wish my daughter to be happy hayde smiled sorrowfully and shook her head do you think of dying my lord said she the wise man my child has said it is good to think of death well if you die said she bequeath your fortune to others for if you die i shall require nothing and taking the paper she tore it in four pieces and threw it into the middle of the room then the effort having exhausted her strength she fell not asleep this time but fainting on the floor the count leaned over her and raised her in his arms and seeing that sweet pale face those lovely eyes closed that beautiful form motionless and to all appearance lifeless the idea occurred to him for the first time that perhaps she loved him otherwise than as a daughter loves a father alas murmured he with intense suffering
