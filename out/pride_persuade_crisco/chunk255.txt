for the third time read the letter oh if he knows the contents of this murmured he and that noirtier is the father of villefort i am lost and he fixed his eyes upon edmond as if he would have penetrated his thoughts oh it is impossible to doubt it cried he suddenly in heavens name cried the unhappy young man if you doubt me question me i will answer you villefort made a violent effort and in a tone he strove to render firm sir said he i am no longer able as i had hoped to restore you immediately to liberty before doing so i must consult the trial justice what my own feeling is you already know oh monsieur cried dants you have been rather a friend than a judge m well i must detain you some time longer but i will strive to make it as short as possible the principal charge against you is this letter and you see villefort approached the fire cast it in and waited until it was entirely consumed you see i destroy it oh exclaimed dants you are goodness itself listen continued villefort you can now have confidence in me after what i have done oh command and i will obey listen this is not a command but advice i give you speak and i will follow your advice i shall detain you until this evening in the palais de justice should anyone else interrogate you say to him what you have said to me but do not breathe a word of this letter i promise it was villefort who seemed to entreat and the prisoner who reassured him you see continued he glancing toward the grate where fragments of burnt paper fluttered in the flames the letter is destroyed you and i alone know of its existence should you therefore be questioned deny all knowledge of it deny it boldly and you are saved be satisfied i will deny it it was the only letter you had it was swear it i swear it villefort rang a police agent entered villefort whispered some words in his ear to which the officer replied by a motion of his head follow him said villefort to dants dants saluted villefort and retired hardly had the door closed when villefort threw himself half-fainting into a chair alas alas murmured he if the procureur himself had been at marseilles i should have been ruined this accursed letter would have destroyed all my hopes oh my father must your past career always interfere with my successes suddenly a light passed over his face a smile played round his set mouth and his haggard eyes were fixed in thought this will do said he and from this letter which might have ruined me i will make my fortune now to the work i have in hand and after having assured himself that the prisoner was gone the deputy procureur hastened to the house of his betrothed m chapter the chteau dif the commissary of police as he traversed the antechamber made a sign to two gendarmes who placed themselves one on dants right and the other on his left a door that communicated with the palais de justice was opened and they went through a long range of gloomy corridors whose appearance might have made even the boldest shudder the palais de justice communicated with the prison a sombre edifice that from its grated windows looks on the clock-tower of the accoules after numberless windings dants saw a door with an iron wicket the commissary took up an iron mallet and knocked thrice every blow seeming to dants as if struck on his heart the door opened the two gendarmes gently pushed him forward and the door closed with a loud sound behind him the air he inhaled was no longer pure but thick and mephitic he was in prison he was conducted to a tolerably neat chamber but grated and barred and its appearance therefore did not greatly alarm him besides the words of villefort who seemed to interest himself so much resounded still in his ears like a promise of freedom it was four oclock when dants was placed in this chamber it was as we have said the st of march and the prisoner was soon buried in darkness the obscurity augmented the acuteness of his hearing at the slightest sound he rose and hastened to the door convinced they were about to liberate him but the sound died away and dants sank again into his seat at last about ten oclock and just as dants began to despair steps were heard in the corridor a key turned in the lock the bolts creaked the massy oaken door flew open and a flood of light from two torches pervaded the apartment by the torchlight dants saw the glittering sabres and carbines of four gendarmes he had advanced at first but stopped at the sight of this display of force are you come to fetch me asked he yes replied a gendarme by the orders of the deputy procureur i believe so the conviction that they came from m de villefort relieved all dants apprehensions he advanced calmly and placed himself in the centre of the escort a carriage waited at the door the coachman was on the box and a police officer sat beside him
