i just know his name a bowing acquaintance wentworth captain wentworth of the navy his sister married my tenant in somersetshire the croft who rents kellynch before sir walter had reached this point annes eyes had caught the right direction and distinguished captain wentworth standing among a cluster of men at a little distance as her eyes fell on him his seemed to be withdrawn from her it had that appearance it seemed as if she had been one moment too late and as long as she dared observe he did not look again but the performance was recommencing and she was forced to seem to restore her attention to the orchestra and look straight forward when she could give another glance he had moved away he could not have come nearer to her if he would she was so surrounded and shut in but she would rather have caught his eye mr elliots speech too distressed her she had no longer any inclination to talk to him she wished him not so near her the first act was over now she hoped for some beneficial change and after a period of nothing-saying amongst the party some of them did decide on going in quest of tea anne was one of the few who did not choose to move she remained in her seat and so did lady russell but she had the pleasure of getting rid of mr elliot and she did not mean whatever she might feel on lady russells account to shrink from conversation with captain wentworth if he gave her the opportunity she was persuaded by lady russells countenance that she had seen him he did not come however anne sometimes fancied she discerned him at a distance but he never came the anxious interval wore away unproductively the others returned the room filled again benches were reclaimed and repossessed and another hour of pleasure or of penance was to be sat out another hour of music was to give delight or the gapes as real or affected taste for it prevailed to anne it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation she could not quit that room in peace without seeing captain wentworth once more without the interchange of one friendly look in re-settling themselves there were now many changes the result of which was favourable for her colonel wallis declined sitting down again and mr elliot was invited by elizabeth and miss carteret in a manner not to be refused to sit between them and by some other removals and a little scheming of her own anne was enabled to place herself much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before much more within reach of a passer-by she could not do so without comparing herself with miss larolles the inimitable miss larolles but still she did it and not with much happier effect though by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication in her next neighbours she found herself at the very end of the bench before the concert closed such was her situation with a vacant space at hand when captain wentworth was again in sight she saw him not far off he saw her too yet he looked grave and seemed irresolute and only by very slow degrees came at last near enough to speak to her she felt that something must be the matter the change was indubitable the difference between his present air and what it had been in the octagon room was strikingly great why was it she thought of her father of lady russell could there have been any unpleasant glances he began by speaking of the concert gravely more like the captain wentworth of uppercross owned himself disappointed had expected singing and in short must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over anne replied and spoke in defence of the performance so well and yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly that his countenance improved and he replied again with almost a smile they talked for a few minutes more the improvement held he even looked down towards the bench as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying when at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged anne to turn round it came from mr elliot he begged her pardon but she must be applied to to explain italian again miss carteret was very anxious to have a general idea of what was next to be sung anne could not refuse but never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit a few minutes though as few as possible were inevitably consumed and when her own mistress again when able to turn and look as she had done before she found herself accosted by captain wentworth in a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell he must wish her good night he was going he should get home as fast as he could is not this song worth staying for said anne suddenly struck by an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging no he replied impressively there is nothing worth my staying for and he was gone directly jealousy of mr elliot it was the only intelligible motive captain wentworth jealous of her affection could she have believed it a week ago three hours ago for
