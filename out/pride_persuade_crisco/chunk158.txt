that i wanted i knew she would i knew that we should either go to the bottom together or that she would be the making of me and i never had two days of foul weather all the time i was at sea in her and after taking privateers enough to be very entertaining i had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn to fall in with the very french frigate i wanted i brought her into plymouth and here another instance of luck we had not been six hours in the sound when a gale came on which lasted four days and nights and which would have done for poor old asp in half the time our touch with the great nation not having much improved our condition four-and-twenty hours later and i should only have been a gallant captain wentworth in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers and being lost in only a sloop nobody would have thought about me annes shudderings were to herself alone but the miss musgroves could be as open as they were sincere in their exclamations of pity and horror and so then i suppose said mrs musgrove in a low voice as if thinking aloud so then he went away to the laconia and there he met with our poor boy charles my dear beckoning him to her do ask captain wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother i always forgot it was at gibraltar mother i know dick had been left ill at gibraltar with a recommendation from his former captain to captain wentworth oh but charles tell captain wentworth he need not be afraid of mentioning poor dick before me for it would be rather a pleasure to hear him talked of by such a good friend charles being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case only nodded in reply and walked away the girls were now hunting for the laconia and captain wentworth could not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume into his own hands to save them the trouble and once more read aloud the little statement of her name and rate and present non-commissioned class observing over it that she too had been one of the best friends man ever had ah those were pleasant days when i had the laconia how fast i made money in her a friend of mine and i had such a lovely cruise together off the western islands poor harville sister you know how much he wanted money worse than myself he had a wife excellent fellow i shall never forget his happiness he felt it all so much for her sake i wished for him again the next summer when i had still the same luck in the mediterranean and i am sure sir said mrs musgrove it was a lucky day for us when you were put captain into that ship we shall never forget what you did her feelings made her speak low and captain wentworth hearing only in part and probably not having dick musgrove at all near his thoughts looked rather in suspense and as if waiting for more my brother whispered one of the girls mamma is thinking of poor richard poor dear fellow continued mrs musgrove he was grown so steady and such an excellent correspondent while he was under your care ah it would have been a happy thing if he had never left you i assure you captain wentworth we are very sorry he ever left you there was a momentary expression in captain wentworths face at this speech a certain glance of his bright eye and curl of his handsome mouth which convinced anne that instead of sharing in mrs musgroves kind wishes as to her son he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him but it was too transient an indulgence of self-amusement to be detected by any who understood him less than herself in another moment he was perfectly collected and serious and almost instantly afterwards coming up to the sofa on which she and mrs musgrove were sitting took a place by the latter and entered into conversation with her in a low voice about her son doing it with so much sympathy and natural grace as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was real and unabsurd in the parents feelings they were actually on the same sofa for mrs musgrove had most readily made room for him they were divided only by mrs musgrove it was no insignificant barrier indeed mrs musgrove was of a comfortable substantial size infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour than tenderness and sentiment and while the agitations of annes slender form and pensive face may be considered as very completely screened captain wentworth should be allowed some credit for the self-command with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son whom alive nobody had cared for personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions a large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction as the most graceful set of limbs in the world but fair or not fair there are unbecoming conjunctions which reason will patronize in vain--which taste cannot tolerate--which ridicule will seize the
