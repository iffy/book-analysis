find in him he had explained away all the appearance of neglect on his own side it had originated in misapprehension entirely he had never had an idea of throwing himself off he had feared that he was thrown off but knew not why and delicacy had kept him silent upon the hint of having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family and the family honours he was quite indignant he who had ever boasted of being an elliot and whose feelings as to connection were only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day he was astonished indeed but his character and general conduct must refute it he could refer sir walter to all who knew him and certainly the pains he had been taking on this the first opportunity of reconciliation to be restored to the footing of a relation and heir-presumptive was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject the circumstances of his marriage too were found to admit of much extenuation this was an article not to be entered on by himself but a very intimate friend of his a colonel wallis a highly respectable man perfectly the gentleman and not an ill-looking man sir walter added who was living in very good style in marlborough buildings and had at his own particular request been admitted to their acquaintance through mr elliot had mentioned one or two things relative to the marriage which made a material difference in the discredit of it colonel wallis had known mr elliot long had been well acquainted also with his wife had perfectly understood the whole story she was certainly not a woman of family but well educated accomplished rich and excessively in love with his friend there had been the charm she had sought him without that attraction not all her money would have tempted elliot and sir walter was moreover assured of her having been a very fine woman here was a great deal to soften the business a very fine woman with a large fortune in love with him sir walter seemed to admit it as complete apology and though elizabeth could not see the circumstance in quite so favourable a light she allowed it be a great extenuation mr elliot had called repeatedly had dined with them once evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked for they gave no dinners in general delighted in short by every proof of cousinly notice and placing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in camden place anne listened but without quite understanding it allowances large allowances she knew must be made for the ideas of those who spoke she heard it all under embellishment all that sounded extravagant or irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin but in the language of the relators still however she had the sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared in mr elliots wishing after an interval of so many years to be well received by them in a worldly view he had nothing to gain by being on terms with sir walter nothing to risk by a state of variance in all probability he was already the richer of the two and the kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title a sensible man and he had looked like a very sensible man why should it be an object to him she could only offer one solution it was perhaps for elizabeths sake there might really have been a liking formerly though convenience and accident had drawn him a different way and now that he could afford to please himself he might mean to pay his addresses to her elizabeth was certainly very handsome with well-bred elegant manners and her character might never have been penetrated by mr elliot knowing her but in public and when very young himself how her temper and understanding might bear the investigation of his present keener time of life was another concern and rather a fearful one most earnestly did she wish that he might not be too nice or too observant if elizabeth were his object and that elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so and that her friend mrs clay was encouraging the idea seemed apparent by a glance or two between them while mr elliots frequent visits were talked of anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at lyme but without being much attended to oh yes perhaps it had been mr elliot they did not know it might be him perhaps they could not listen to her description of him they were describing him themselves sir walter especially he did justice to his very gentlemanlike appearance his air of elegance and fashion his good shaped face his sensible eye but at the same time must lament his being very much under-hung a defect which time seemed to have increased nor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered almost every feature for the worse mr elliot appeared to think that he sir walter was looking exactly as he had done when they last parted but sir walter had not been able to return the compliment entirely which had embarrassed him he did not mean to complain however mr elliot was better to look at than most men and he had no objection to being
