a little while anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again the sweet scenes of autumn were for a while put by unless some tender sonnet fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year with declining happiness and the images of youth and hope and spring all gone together blessed her memory she roused herself to say as they struck by order into another path is not this one of the ways to winthrop but nobody heard or at least nobody answered her winthrop however or its environs--for young men are sometimes to be met with strolling about near home--was their destination and after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures where the ploughs at work and the fresh made path spoke the farmer counteracting the sweets of poetical despondence and meaning to have spring again they gained the summit of the most considerable hill which parted uppercross and winthrop and soon commanded a full view of the latter at the foot of the hill on the other side winthrop without beauty and without dignity was stretched before them an indifferent house standing low and hemmed in by the barns and buildings of a farm-yard mary exclaimed bless me here is winthrop i declare i had no idea well now i think we had better turn back i am excessively tired henrietta conscious and ashamed and seeing no cousin charles walking along any path or leaning against any gate was ready to do as mary wished but no said charles musgrove and no no cried louisa more eagerly and taking her sister aside seemed to be arguing the matter warmly charles in the meanwhile was very decidedly declaring his resolution of calling on his aunt now that he was so near and very evidently though more fearfully trying to induce his wife to go too but this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength and when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter of an hour at winthrop as she felt so tired she resolutely answered oh no indeed walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any sitting down could do her good and in short her look and manner declared that go she would not after a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations it was settled between charles and his two sisters that he and henrietta should just run down for a few minutes to see their aunt and cousins while the rest of the party waited for them at the top of the hill louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan and as she went a little way with them down the hill still talking to henrietta mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her and saying to captain wentworth it is very unpleasant having such connexions but i assure you i have never been in the house above twice in my life she received no other answer than an artificial assenting smile followed by a contemptuous glance as he turned away which anne perfectly knew the meaning of the brow of the hill where they remained was a cheerful spot louisa returned and mary finding a comfortable seat for herself on the step of a stile was very well satisfied so long as the others all stood about her but when louisa drew captain wentworth away to try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge-row and they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound mary was happy no longer she quarrelled with her own seat was sure louisa had got a much better somewhere and nothing could prevent her from going to look for a better also she turned through the same gate but could not see them anne found a nice seat for her on a dry sunny bank under the hedge-row in which she had no doubt of their still being in some spot or other mary sat down for a moment but it would not do she was sure louisa had found a better seat somewhere else and she would go on till she overtook her anne really tired herself was glad to sit down and she very soon heard captain wentworth and louisa in the hedge-row behind her as if making their way back along the rough wild sort of channel down the centre they were speaking as they drew near louisas voice was the first distinguished she seemed to be in the middle of some eager speech what anne first heard was and so i made her go i could not bear that she should be frightened from the visit by such nonsense what would i be turned back from doing a thing that i had determined to do and that i knew to be right by the airs and interference of such a person or of any person i may say no i have no idea of being so easily persuaded when i have made up my mind i have made it and henrietta seemed entirely to have made up hers to call at winthrop to-day and yet she was as near giving it up out of nonsensical complaisance she would have turned back then but for you she would indeed i am almost ashamed to say it happy for her to have such a mind as yours
