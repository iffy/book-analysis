this was done she had a less active part to play it became her turn to listen mrs bennet had many grievances to relate and much to complain of they had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister two of her girls had been upon the point of marriage and after all there was nothing in it i do not blame jane she continued for jane would have got mr bingley if she could but lizzy oh sister it is very hard to think that she might have been mr collinss wife by this time had it not been for her own perverseness he made her an offer in this very room and she refused him the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have and that the longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever the lucases are very artful people indeed sister they are all for what they can get i am sorry to say it of them but so it is it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else however your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves mrs gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before in the course of jane and elizabeths correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she i am sorry it went off but these things happen so often a young man such as you describe mr bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not do for us we do not suffer by accident it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea it is as often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hours acquaintance as to a real strong attachment pray how violent was mr bingleys love i never saw a more promising inclination he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her every time they met it was more decided and remarkable at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer could there be finer symptoms is not general incivility the very essence of love oh yes of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt poor jane i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get over it immediately it had better have happened to you lizzy you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner but do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded of her sisters ready acquiescence i hope added mrs gardiner that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her we live in so different a part of town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable that they should meet at all unless he really comes to see her and that is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of his friend and mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london my dear aunt how could you think of it mr darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but he would hardly think a months ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it mr bingley never stirs without him so much the better i hope they will not meet at all but does not jane correspond with his sister she will not be able to help calling she will drop the acquaintance entirely but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point as well as the still more interesting one of bingleys being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopeless it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be reanimated and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of janes attractions miss bennet accepted her aunts invitation with pleasure and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she hoped by carolines not
