spot they chose did not suit the smuggler who filled the post of sentinel for he cried out not that way if you please gaetano faltered an excuse and advanced to the opposite side while two sailors kindled torches at the fire to light them on their way they advanced about thirty paces and then stopped at a small esplanade surrounded with rocks in which seats had been cut not unlike sentry-boxes around in the crevices of the rocks grew a few dwarf oaks and thick bushes of myrtles franz lowered a torch and saw by the mass of cinders that had accumulated that he was not the first to discover this retreat which was doubtless one of the halting-places of the wandering visitors of monte cristo as for his suspicions once on terra firma once that he had seen the indifferent if not friendly appearance of his hosts his anxiety had quite disappeared or rather at sight of the goat had turned to appetite he mentioned this to gaetano who replied that nothing could be more easy than to prepare a supper when they had in their boat bread wine half a dozen partridges and a good fire to roast them by besides added he if the smell of their roast meat tempts you i will go and offer them two of our birds for a slice you are a born diplomat returned franz go and try meanwhile the sailors had collected dried sticks and branches with which they made a fire franz waited impatiently inhaling the aroma of the roasted meat when the captain returned with a mysterious air well said franz anything new do they refuse on the contrary returned gaetano the chief who was told you were a young frenchman invites you to sup with him well observed franz this chief is very polite and i see no objection the more so as i bring my share of the supper oh it is not that he has plenty and to spare for supper but he makes one condition and rather a peculiar one before he will receive you at his house his house has he built one here then no but he has a very comfortable one all the same so they say you know this chief then i have heard talk of him favorably or otherwise both the deuce and what is this condition that you are blindfolded and do not take off the bandage until he himself bids you franz looked at gaetano to see if possible what he thought of this proposal ah replied he guessing franzs thought i know this is a serious matter what should you do in my place i who have nothing to lose i should go m you would accept yes were it only out of curiosity there is something very peculiar about this chief then listen said gaetano lowering his voice i do not know if what they say is true he stopped to see if anyone was near what do they say that this chief inhabits a cavern to which the pitti palace is nothing what nonsense said franz reseating himself it is no nonsense it is quite true cama the pilot of the saint ferdinand went in once and he came back amazed vowing that such treasures were only to be heard of in fairy tales do you know observed franz that with such stories you make me think of ali babas enchanted cavern i tell you what i have been told then you advise me to accept oh i dont say that your excellency will do as you please i should be sorry to advise you in the matter franz pondered the matter for a few moments concluded that a man so rich could not have any intention of plundering him of what little he had and seeing only the prospect of a good supper accepted gaetano departed with the reply franz was prudent and wished to learn all he possibly could concerning his host he turned towards the sailor who during this dialogue had sat gravely plucking the partridges with the air of a man proud of his office and asked him how these men had landed as no vessel of any kind was visible never mind that returned the sailor i know their vessel is it a very beautiful vessel i would not wish for a better to sail round the world of what burden is she about a hundred tons but she is built to stand any weather she is what the english call a yacht where was she built i know not but my own opinion is she is a genoese and how did a leader of smugglers continued franz venture to build a vessel designed for such a purpose at genoa i did not say that the owner was a smuggler replied the sailor no but gaetano did i thought gaetano had only seen the vessel from a distance he had not then spoken to anyone and if this person be not a smuggler who is he a wealthy signor who travels for his pleasure come thought franz he is still more mysterious since the two accounts do not agree what is his name if you ask him he says sinbad the sailor but i doubt if it be his real name sinbad the sailor yes and where does he reside
