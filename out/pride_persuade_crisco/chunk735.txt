the same here as in paris how so here you laugh the counts brow became clouded you are right to recall me to myself maximilian he said i was delighted to see you again and forgot for the moment that all happiness is fleeting oh no no count cried maximilian seizing the counts hands pray laugh be happy and prove to me by your indifference that life is endurable to sufferers oh how charitable kind and good you are you affect this gayety to inspire me with courage you are wrong morrel i was really happy then you forget me so much the better how so yes for as the gladiator said to the emperor when he entered the arena he who is about to die salutes you then you are not consoled asked the count surprised oh exclaimed morrel with a glance full of bitter reproach do you think it possible that i could be listen said the count do you understand the meaning of my words you cannot take me for a commonplace man a mere rattle emitting a vague and senseless noise when i ask you if you are consoled i speak to you as a man for whom the human heart has no secrets well morrel let us both examine the depths of your heart do you still feel the same feverish impatience of grief which made you start like a wounded lion have you still that devouring thirst which can only be appeased in the grave are you still actuated by the regret which drags the living to the pursuit of death or are you only suffering from the prostration of fatigue and the weariness of hope deferred has the loss of memory rendered it impossible for you to weep oh my dear friend if this be the case if you can no longer weep if your frozen heart be dead if you put all your trust in god then maximilian you are consoled do not complain count said morrel in a firm and at the same time soft voice listen to me as to a man whose thoughts are raised to heaven though he remains on earth i come to die in the arms of a friend certainly there are people whom i love i love my sister julie i love her husband emmanuel but i require a strong mind to smile on my last moments my sister would be bathed in tears and fainting i could not bear to see her suffer emmanuel would tear the weapon from my hand and alarm the house with his cries you count who are more than mortal will i am sure lead me to death by a pleasant path will you not m my friend said the count i have still one doubt are you weak enough to pride yourself upon your sufferings no indeed i am calm said morrel giving his hand to the count my pulse does not beat slower or faster than usual no i feel that i have reached the goal and i will go no farther you told me to wait and hope do you know what you did unfortunate adviser i waited a month or rather i suffered for a month i did hope man is a poor wretched creature i did hope what i cannot tell something wonderful an absurdity a miracle of what nature he alone can tell who has mingled with our reason that folly we call hope yes i did wait yes i did hope count and during this quarter of an hour we have been talking together you have unconsciously wounded tortured my heart for every word you have uttered proved that there was no hope for me oh count i shall sleep calmly deliciously in the arms of death morrel uttered these words with an energy which made the count shudder my friend continued morrel you named the fifth of october as the end of the period of waiting today is the fifth of october he took out his watch it is now nine oclock i have yet three hours to live be it so said the count come morrel mechanically followed the count and they had entered the grotto before he perceived it he felt a carpet under his feet a door opened perfumes surrounded him and a brilliant light dazzled his eyes morrel hesitated to advance he dreaded the enervating effect of all that he saw monte cristo drew him in gently why should we not spend the last three hours remaining to us of life like those ancient romans who when condemned by nero their emperor and heir sat down at a table covered with flowers and gently glided into death amid the perfume of heliotropes and roses morrel smiled as you please he said death is always death that is forgetfulness repose exclusion from life and therefore from grief he sat down and monte cristo placed himself opposite to him they were in the marvellous dining-room before described where the statues had baskets on their heads always filled with fruits and flowers morrel had looked carelessly around and had probably noticed nothing let us talk like men he said looking at the count go on count said morrel you are the epitome of all human knowledge and you seem like a being descended from a wiser and more advanced world than ours
