of way and with that property he will never be a contemptible man--good freehold property no no henrietta might do worse than marry charles hayter and if she has him and louisa can get captain wentworth i shall be very well satisfied charles may say what he pleases cried mary to anne as soon as he was out of the room but it would be shocking to have henrietta marry charles hayter a very bad thing for her and still worse for me and therefore it is very much to be wished that captain wentworth may soon put him quite out of her head and i have very little doubt that he has she took hardly any notice of charles hayter yesterday i wish you had been there to see her behaviour and as to captain wentworths liking louisa as well as henrietta it is nonsense to say so for he certainly does like henrietta a great deal the best but charles is so positive i wish you had been with us yesterday for then you might have decided between us and i am sure you would have thought as i did unless you had been determined to give it against me a dinner at mr musgroves had been the occasion when all these things should have been seen by anne but she had staid at home under the mixed plea of a headache of her own and some return of indisposition in little charles she had thought only of avoiding captain wentworth but an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening as to captain wentworths views she deemed it of more consequence that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering the happiness of either sister or impeaching his own honour than that he should prefer henrietta to louisa or louisa to henrietta either of them would in all probability make him an affectionate good-humoured wife with regard to charles hayter she had delicacy which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning young woman and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned but if henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings the alteration could not be understood too soon charles hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him in his cousins behaviour she had too old a regard for him to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope and leave him nothing to do but to keep away from uppercross but there was such a change as became very alarming when such a man as captain wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause he had been absent only two sundays and when they parted had left her interested even to the height of his wishes in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy and obtaining that of uppercross instead it had then seemed the object nearest her heart that dr shirley the rector who for more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office but was now growing too infirm for many of them should be quite fixed on engaging a curate should make his curacy quite as good as he could afford and should give charles hayter the promise of it the advantage of his having to come only to uppercross instead of going six miles another way of his having in every respect a better curacy of his belonging to their dear dr shirley and of dear good dr shirleys being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through without most injurious fatigue had been a great deal even to louisa but had been almost everything to henrietta when he came back alas the zeal of the business was gone by louisa could not listen at all to his account of a conversation which he had just held with dr shirley she was at a window looking out for captain wentworth and even henrietta had at best only a divided attention to give and seemed to have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation well i am very glad indeed but i always thought you would have it i always thought you sure it did not appear to me that--in short you know dr shirley must have a curate and you had secured his promise is he coming louisa one morning very soon after the dinner at the musgroves at which anne had not been present captain wentworth walked into the drawing-room at the cottage where were only herself and the little invalid charles who was lying on the sofa the surprise of finding himself almost alone with anne elliot deprived his manners of their usual composure he started and could only say i thought the miss musgroves had been here mrs musgrove told me i should find them here before he walked to the window to recollect himself and feel how he ought to behave they are up stairs with my sister they will be down in a few moments i dare say had been annes reply in all the confusion that was natural and if the child had not called her to come and do something for him she would have been out of the room the next moment and
