and though franz had been unable to distinguish his features from his being either wrapped in his mantle or obscured by the shadow the tones of his voice had made too powerful an impression on him the first time he had heard them for him ever again to forget them hear them when or where he might it was more especially when this man was speaking in a manner half jesting half bitter that franzs ear recalled most vividly the deep sonorous yet well-pitched voice that had addressed him in the grotto of monte cristo and which he heard for the second time amid the darkness and ruined grandeur of the colosseum and the more he thought the more entire was his conviction that the person who wore the mantle was no other than his former host and entertainer sinbad the sailor m under any other circumstances franz would have found it impossible to resist his extreme curiosity to know more of so singular a personage and with that intent have sought to renew their short acquaintance but in the present instance the confidential nature of the conversation he had overheard made him with propriety judge that his appearance at such a time would be anything but agreeable as we have seen therefore he permitted his former host to retire without attempting a recognition but fully promising himself a rich indemnity for his present forbearance should chance afford him another opportunity in vain did franz endeavor to forget the many perplexing thoughts which assailed him in vain did he court the refreshment of sleep slumber refused to visit his eyelids and the night was passed in feverish contemplation of the chain of circumstances tending to prove the identity of the mysterious visitant to the colosseum with the inhabitant of the grotto of monte cristo and the more he thought the firmer grew his opinion on the subject worn out at length he fell asleep at daybreak and did not awake till late like a genuine frenchman albert had employed his time in arranging for the evenings diversion he had sent to engage a box at the teatro argentina and franz having a number of letters to write relinquished the carriage to albert for the whole of the day at five oclock albert returned delighted with his days work he had been occupied in leaving his letters of introduction and had received in return more invitations to balls and routs than it would be possible for him to accept besides this he had seen as he called it all the remarkable sights at rome yes in a single day he had accomplished what his more serious-minded companion would have taken weeks to effect neither had he neglected to ascertain the name of the piece to be played that night at the teatro argentina and also what performers appeared in it the opera of parisina was announced for representation and the principal actors were coselli moriani and la specchia the young men therefore had reason to consider themselves fortunate in having the opportunity of hearing one of the best works by the composer of lucia di lammermoor supported by three of the most renowned vocalists of italy albert had never been able to endure the italian theatres with their orchestras from which it is impossible to see and the absence of balconies or open boxes all these defects pressed hard on a man who had had his stall at the bouffes and had shared a lower box at the opera still in spite of this albert displayed his most dazzling and effective costumes each time he visited the theatres but alas his elegant toilet was wholly thrown away and one of the most worthy representatives of parisian fashion had to carry with him the mortifying reflection that he had nearly overrun italy without meeting with a single adventure sometimes albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success but internally he was deeply wounded and his self-love immensely piqued to think that albert de morcerf the most admired and most sought after of any young person of his day should thus be passed over and merely have his labor for his pains and the thing was so much the more annoying as according to the characteristic modesty of a frenchman albert had quitted paris with the full conviction that he had only to show himself in italy to carry all before him and that upon his return he should astonish the parisian world with the recital of his numerous love-affairs alas poor albert none of those interesting adventures fell in his way the lovely genoese florentines and neapolitans were all faithful if not to their husbands at least to their lovers and thought not of changing even for the splendid appearance of albert de morcerf and all he gained was the painful conviction that the ladies of italy have this advantage over those of france that they are faithful even in their infidelity yet he could not restrain a hope that in italy as elsewhere there might be an exception to the general rule albert besides being an elegant well-looking young man was also possessed of considerable talent and ability moreover he was a viscount a recently created one certainly but in the present day it is not necessary to go as far back as noah in tracing a descent and
