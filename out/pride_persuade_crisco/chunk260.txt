into tears and as villefort strove to pass her again addressed him but at least tell me where he is that i may know whether he is alive or dead said she m i do not know he is no longer in my hands replied villefort and desirous of putting an end to the interview he pushed by her and closed the door as if to exclude the pain he felt but remorse is not thus banished like virgils wounded hero he carried the arrow in his wound and arrived at the salon villefort uttered a sigh that was almost a sob and sank into a chair then the first pangs of an unending torture seized upon his heart the man he sacrificed to his ambition that innocent victim immolated on the altar of his fathers faults appeared to him pale and threatening leading his affianced bride by the hand and bringing with him remorse not such as the ancients figured furious and terrible but that slow and consuming agony whose pangs are intensified from hour to hour up to the very moment of death then he had a moments hesitation he had frequently called for capital punishment on criminals and owing to his irresistible eloquence they had been condemned and yet the slightest shadow of remorse had never clouded villeforts brow because they were guilty at least he believed so but here was an innocent man whose happiness he had destroyed in this case he was not the judge but the executioner as he thus reflected he felt the sensation we have described and which had hitherto been unknown to him arise in his bosom and fill him with vague apprehensions it is thus that a wounded man trembles instinctively at the approach of the finger to his wound until it be healed but villeforts was one of those that never close or if they do only close to reopen more agonizing than ever if at this moment the sweet voice of rene had sounded in his ears pleading for mercy or the fair mercds had entered and said in the name of god i conjure you to restore me my affianced husband his cold and trembling hands would have signed his release but no voice broke the stillness of the chamber and the door was opened only by villeforts valet who came to tell him that the travelling carriage was in readiness villefort rose or rather sprang from his chair hastily opened one of the drawers of his desk emptied all the gold it contained into his pocket stood motionless an instant his hand pressed to his head muttered a few inarticulate sounds and then perceiving that his servant had placed his cloak on his shoulders he sprang into the carriage ordering the postilions to drive to m de saint-mrans the hapless dants was doomed as the marquis had promised villefort found the marquise and rene in waiting he started when he saw rene for he fancied she was again about to plead for dants alas her emotions were wholly personal she was thinking only of villeforts departure she loved villefort and he left her at the moment he was about to become her husband villefort knew not when he should return and rene far from pleading for dants hated the man whose crime separated her from her lover m meanwhile what of mercds she had met fernand at the corner of the rue de la loge she had returned to the catalans and had despairingly cast herself on her couch fernand kneeling by her side took her hand and covered it with kisses that mercds did not even feel she passed the night thus the lamp went out for want of oil but she paid no heed to the darkness and dawn came but she knew not that it was day grief had made her blind to all but one object that was edmond ah you are there said she at length turning towards fernand i have not quitted you since yesterday returned fernand sorrowfully m morrel had not readily given up the fight he had learned that dants had been taken to prison and he had gone to all his friends and the influential persons of the city but the report was already in circulation that dants was arrested as a bonapartist agent and as the most sanguine looked upon any attempt of napoleon to remount the throne as impossible he met with nothing but refusal and had returned home in despair declaring that the matter was serious and that nothing more could be done caderousse was equally restless and uneasy but instead of seeking like m morrel to aid dants he had shut himself up with two bottles of black currant brandy in the hope of drowning reflection but he did not succeed and became too intoxicated to fetch any more drink and yet not so intoxicated as to forget what had happened with his elbows on the table he sat between the two empty bottles while spectres danced in the light of the unsnuffed candle spectres such as hoffmann strews over his punch-drenched pages like black fantastic dust danglars alone was content and joyous he had got rid of an enemy and made his own situation on the pharaon secure danglars was one of those men born with a pen behind the ear and an inkstand
