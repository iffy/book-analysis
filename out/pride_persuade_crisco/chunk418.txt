been as powerful as if heaven had brought me into the world on the steps of a throne and it was peppino you saved was it not cried morcerf it was for him that you obtained pardon perhaps returned the count smiling my dear count you have no idea what pleasure it gives me to hear you speak thus said morcerf i had announced you beforehand to my friends as an enchanter of the arabian nights a wizard of the middle ages but the parisians are so subtle in paradoxes that they mistake for caprices of the imagination the most incontestable truths when these truths do not form a part of their daily existence for example here is debray who reads and beauchamp who prints every day a member of the jockey club has been stopped and robbed on the boulevard four persons have been assassinated in the rue st denis or the faubourg st germain ten fifteen or twenty thieves have been arrested in a caf on the boulevard du temple or in the thermes de julien and yet these same men deny the existence of the bandits in the maremma the campagna di romana or the pontine marshes tell them yourself that i was taken by bandits and that without your generous intercession i should now have been sleeping in the catacombs of st sebastian instead of receiving them in my humble abode in the rue du helder ah said monte cristo you promised me never to mention that circumstance it was not i who made that promise cried morcerf it must have been someone else whom you have rescued in the same manner and whom you have forgotten pray speak of it for i shall not only i trust relate the little i do know but also a great deal i do not know it seems to me returned the count smiling that you played a sufficiently important part to know as well as myself what happened m well you promise me if i tell all i know to relate in your turn all that i do not know that is but fair replied monte cristo well said morcerf for three days i believed myself the object of the attentions of a masque whom i took for a descendant of tullia or poppa while i was simply the object of the attentions of a contadina and i say contadina to avoid saying peasant girl what i know is that like a fool a greater fool than he of whom i spoke just now i mistook for this peasant girl a young bandit of fifteen or sixteen with a beardless chin and slim waist and who just as i was about to imprint a chaste salute on his lips placed a pistol to my head and aided by seven or eight others led or rather dragged me to the catacombs of st sebastian where i found a highly educated brigand chief perusing csars commentaries and who deigned to leave off reading to inform me that unless the next morning before six oclock four thousand piastres were paid into his account at his bankers at a quarter past six i should have ceased to exist the letter is still to be seen for it is in franz dpinays possession signed by me and with a postscript of m luigi vampa this is all i know but i know not count how you contrived to inspire so much respect in the bandits of rome who ordinarily have so little respect for anything i assure you franz and i were lost in admiration nothing more simple returned the count i had known the famous vampa for more than ten years when he was quite a child and only a shepherd i gave him a few gold pieces for showing me my way and he in order to repay me gave me a poniard the hilt of which he had carved with his own hand and which you may have seen in my collection of arms in after years whether he had forgotten this interchange of presents which ought to have cemented our friendship or whether he did not recollect me he sought to take me but on the contrary it was i who captured him and a dozen of his band i might have handed him over to roman justice which is somewhat expeditious and which would have been particularly so with him but i did nothing of the sort i suffered him and his band to depart with the condition that they should sin no more said beauchamp laughing i see they kept their promise no monsieur returned monte cristo upon the simple condition that they should respect myself and my friends perhaps what i am about to say may seem strange to you who are socialists and vaunt humanity and your duty to your neighbor but i never seek to protect a society which does not protect me and which i will even say generally occupies itself about me only to injure me and thus by giving them a low place in my esteem and preserving a neutrality towards them it is society and my neighbor who are indebted to me bravo cried chteau-renaud you are the first man i ever met sufficiently courageous to preach egotism bravo count bravo it is frank at least said morrel but i am sure
