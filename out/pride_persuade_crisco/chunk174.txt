quite walking enough by the time he reached home determined the direction of all the party in what was to be their last walk they would accompany them to their door and then return and set off themselves by all their calculations there was just time for this but as they drew near the cobb there was such a general wish to walk along it once more all were so inclined and louisa soon grew so determined that the difference of a quarter of an hour it was found would be no difference at all so with all the kind leave-taking and all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which may be imagined they parted from captain and mrs harville at their own door and still accompanied by captain benwick who seemed to cling to them to the last proceeded to make the proper adieus to the cobb anne found captain benwick again drawing near her lord byrons dark blue seas could not fail of being brought forward by their present view and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as attention was possible it was soon drawn perforce another way there was too much wind to make the high part of the new cobb pleasant for the ladies and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower and all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight excepting louisa she must be jumped down them by captain wentworth in all their walks he had had to jump her from the stiles the sensation was delightful to her the hardness of the pavement for her feet made him less willing upon the present occasion he did it however she was safely down and instantly to show her enjoyment ran up the steps to be jumped down again he advised her against it thought the jar too great but no he reasoned and talked in vain she smiled and said i am determined i will he put out his hands she was too precipitate by half a second she fell on the pavement on the lower cobb and was taken up lifeless there was no wound no blood no visible bruise but her eyes were closed she breathed not her face was like death the horror of the moment to all who stood around captain wentworth who had caught her up knelt with her in his arms looking on her with a face as pallid as her own in an agony of silence she is dead she is dead screamed mary catching hold of her husband and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable and in another moment henrietta sinking under the conviction lost her senses too and would have fallen on the steps but for captain benwick and anne who caught and supported her between them is there no one to help me were the first words which burst from captain wentworth in a tone of despair and as if all his own strength were gone go to him go to him cried anne for heavens sake go to him i can support her myself leave me and go to him rub her hands rub her temples here are salts take them take them captain benwick obeyed and charles at the same moment disengaging himself from his wife they were both with him and louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them and everything was done that anne had prompted but in vain while captain wentworth staggering against the wall for his support exclaimed in the bitterest agony oh god her father and mother a surgeon said anne he caught the word it seemed to rouse him at once and saying only true true a surgeon this instant was darting away when anne eagerly suggested captain benwick would not it be better for captain benwick he knows where a surgeon is to be found every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea and in a moment it was all done in rapid moments captain benwick had resigned the poor corpse-like figure entirely to the brothers care and was off for the town with the utmost rapidity as to the wretched party left behind it could scarcely be said which of the three who were completely rational was suffering most captain wentworth anne or charles who really a very affectionate brother hung over louisa with sobs of grief and could only turn his eyes from one sister to see the other in a state as insensible or to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife calling on him for help which he could not give anne attending with all the strength and zeal and thought which instinct supplied to henrietta still tried at intervals to suggest comfort to the others tried to quiet mary to animate charles to assuage the feelings of captain wentworth both seemed to look to her for directions anne anne cried charles what is to be done next what in heavens name is to be done next captain wentworths eyes were also turned towards her had not she better be carried to the inn yes i am sure carry her gently to the inn yes yes to the inn repeated captain wentworth comparatively collected and eager to be doing something i will carry her myself musgrove take care of the others by this time
