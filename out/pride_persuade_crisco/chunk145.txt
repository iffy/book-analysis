feelings of her calmness but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important from whatever it sprung and in the event of admiral croft's really taking kellynch hall she rejoiced anew over the conviction which had always been most grateful to her of the past being known to those three only among her connexions by whom no syllable she believed would ever be whispered and in the trust that among his the brother only with whom he had been residing had received any information of their short-lived engagement that brother had been long removed from the country and being a sensible man and moreover a single man at the time she had a fond dependence on no human creature's having heard of it from him the sister mrs croft had then been out of england accompanying her husband on a foreign station and her own sister mary had been at school while it all occurred and never admitted by the pride of some and the delicacy of others to the smallest knowledge of it afterwards with these supports she hoped that the acquaintance between herself and the crofts which with lady russell still resident in kellynch and mary fixed only three miles off must be anticipated need not involve any particular awkwardness chapter on the morning appointed for admiral and mrs croft's seeing kellynch hall anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to lady russell's and keep out of the way till all was over when she found it most natural to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them this meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory and decided the whole business at once each lady was previously well disposed for an agreement and saw nothing therefore but good manners in the other and with regard to the gentlemen there was such an hearty good humour such an open trusting liberality on the admiral's side as could not but influence sir walter who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished behaviour by mr shepherd's assurances of his being known by report to the admiral as a model of good breeding the house and grounds and furniture were approved the crofts were approved terms time every thing and every body was right and mr shepherd's clerks were set to work without there having been a single preliminary difference to modify of all that this indenture sheweth sir walter without hesitation declared the admiral to be the best-looking sailor he had ever met with and went so far as to say that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where and the admiral with sympathetic cordiality observed to his wife as they drove back through the park i thought we should soon come to a deal my dear in spite of what they told us at taunton the baronet will never set the thames on fire but there seems to be no harm in him--reciprocal compliments which would have been esteemed about equal the crofts were to have possession at michaelmas and as sir walter proposed removing to bath in the course of the preceding month there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement lady russell convinced that anne would not be allowed to be of any use or any importance in the choice of the house which they were going to secure was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might convey her to bath herself after christmas but having engagements of her own which must take her from kellynch for several weeks she was unable to give the full invitation she wished and anne though dreading the possible heats of september in all the white glare of bath and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad of the autumnal months in the country did not think that everything considered she wished to remain it would be most right and most wise and therefore must involve least suffering to go with the others something occurred however to give her a different duty mary often a little unwell and always thinking a great deal of her own complaints and always in the habit of claiming anne when anything was the matter was indisposed and foreseeing that she should not have a day's health all the autumn entreated or rather required her for it was hardly entreaty to come to uppercross cottage and bear her company as long as she should want her instead of going to bath i cannot possibly do without anne was mary's reasoning and elizabeth's reply was then i am sure anne had better stay for nobody will want her in bath to be claimed as a good though in an improper style is at least better than being rejected as no good at all and anne glad to be thought of some use glad to have anything marked out as a duty and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country and her own dear country readily agreed to stay this invitation of mary's removed all lady russell's difficulties and it was consequently soon settled that anne should not go to bath
