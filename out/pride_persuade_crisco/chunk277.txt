than to god forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us yet in spite of his earnest prayers dants remained a prisoner then gloom settled heavily upon him dants was a man of great simplicity of thought and without education he could not therefore in the solitude of his dungeon traverse in mental vision the history of the ages bring to life the nations that had perished and rebuild the ancient cities so vast and stupendous in the light of the imagination and that pass before the eye glowing with celestial colors in martins babylonian pictures he could not do this he whose past life was so short whose present so melancholy and his future so doubtful nineteen years of light to reflect upon in eternal darkness no distraction could come to his aid his energetic spirit that would have exalted in thus revisiting the past was imprisoned like an eagle in a cage he clung to one idea that of his happiness destroyed without apparent cause by an unheard-of fatality he considered and reconsidered this idea devoured it so to speak as the implacable ugolino devours the skull of archbishop roger in the inferno of dante rage supplanted religious fervor dants uttered blasphemies that made his jailer recoil with horror dashed himself furiously against the walls of his prison wreaked his anger upon everything and chiefly upon himself so that the least thing a grain of sand a straw or a breath of air that annoyed him led to paroxysms of fury then the letter that villefort had showed to him recurred to his mind and every line gleamed forth in fiery letters on the wall like the mene mene tekel upharsin of belshazzar he told himself that it was the enmity of man and not the vengeance of heaven that had thus plunged him into the deepest misery he consigned his unknown persecutors to the most horrible tortures he could imagine and found them all insufficient because after torture came death and after death if not repose at least the boon of unconsciousness by dint of constantly dwelling on the idea that tranquillity was death and if punishment were the end in view other tortures than death must be invented he began to reflect on suicide unhappy he who on the brink of misfortune broods over ideas like these before him is a dead sea that stretches in azure calm before the eye but he who unwarily ventures within its embrace finds himself struggling with a monster that would drag him down to perdition once thus ensnared unless the protecting hand of god snatch him thence all is over and his struggles but tend to hasten his destruction this state of mental anguish is however less terrible than the sufferings that precede or the punishment that possibly will follow there is a sort of consolation at the contemplation of the yawning abyss at the bottom of which lie darkness and obscurity edmond found some solace in these ideas all his sorrows all his sufferings with their train of gloomy spectres fled from his cell when the angel of death seemed about to enter dants reviewed his past life with composure and looking forward with terror to his future existence chose that middle line that seemed to afford him a refuge sometimes said he in my voyages when i was a man and commanded other men i have seen the heavens overcast the sea rage and foam the storm arise and like a monstrous bird beating the two horizons with its wings then i felt that my vessel was a vain refuge that trembled and shook before the tempest soon the fury of the waves and the sight of the sharp rocks announced the approach of death and death then terrified me and i used all my skill and intelligence as a man and a sailor to struggle against the wrath of god but i did so because i was happy because i had not courted death because to be cast upon a bed of rocks and seaweed seemed terrible because i was unwilling that i a creature made for the service of god should serve for food to the gulls and ravens but now it is different i have lost all that bound me to life death smiles and invites me to repose i die after my own manner i die exhausted and broken-spirited as i fall asleep when i have paced three thousand times round my cell that is thirty thousand steps or about ten leagues no sooner had this idea taken possession of him than he became more composed arranged his couch to the best of his power ate little and slept less and found existence almost supportable because he felt that he could throw it off at pleasure like a worn-out garment two methods of self-destruction were at his disposal he could hang himself with his handkerchief to the window bars or refuse food and die of starvation but the first was repugnant to him dants had always entertained the greatest horror of pirates who are hung up to the yard-arm he would not die by what seemed an infamous death he resolved to adopt the second and began that day to carry out his resolve m nearly four years had passed away at the end of the second he had ceased to
