wall at a distance albert thought it was a complete suit for he counted from the ace to the ten ah ha said albert i see you were preparing for a game of cards no said the count i was making a suit how said albert those are really aces and twos which you see but my shots have turned them into threes fives sevens eights nines and tens albert approached in fact the bullets had actually pierced the cards in the exact places which the painted signs would otherwise have occupied the lines and distances being as regularly kept as if they had been ruled with pencil in going up to the target morcerf picked up two or three swallows that had been rash enough to come within the range of the counts pistol diable said morcerf what would you have my dear viscount said monte cristo wiping his hands on the towel which ali had brought him i must occupy my leisure moments in some way or other but come i am waiting for you both men entered monte cristos carriage which in the course of a few minutes deposited them safely at no monte cristo took albert into his study and pointing to a seat placed another for himself now let us talk the matter over quietly said the count you see i am perfectly composed said albert with whom are you going to fight with beauchamp one of your friends of course it is always with friends that one fights i suppose you have some cause of quarrel i have m what has he done to you there appeared in his journal last night but wait and read for yourself and albert handed over the paper to the count who read as follows a correspondent at yanina informs us of a fact of which until now we had remained in ignorance the castle which formed the protection of the town was given up to the turks by a french officer named fernand in whom the grand vizier ali tepelini had reposed the greatest confidence well said monte cristo what do you see in that to annoy you what do i see in it yes what does it signify to you if the castle of yanina was given up by a french officer it signifies to my father the count of morcerf whose christian name is fernand did your father serve under ali pasha yes that is to say he fought for the independence of the greeks and hence arises the calumny oh my dear viscount do talk reason i do not desire to do otherwise now just tell me who the devil should know in france that the officer fernand and the count of morcerf are one and the same person and who cares now about yanina which was taken as long ago as the year or that just shows the meanness of this slander they have allowed all this time to elapse and then all of a sudden rake up events which have been forgotten to furnish materials for scandal in order to tarnish the lustre of our high position i inherit my fathers name and i do not choose that the shadow of disgrace should darken it i am going to beauchamp in whose journal this paragraph appears and i shall insist on his retracting the assertion before two witnesses beauchamp will never retract then we must fight no you will not for he will tell you what is very true that perhaps there were fifty officers in the greek army bearing the same name we will fight nevertheless i will efface that blot on my fathers character my father who was such a brave soldier whose career was so brilliant oh well he will add we are warranted in believing that this fernand is not the illustrious count of morcerf who also bears the same christian name i am determined not to be content with anything short of an entire retractation and you intend to make him do it in the presence of two witnesses do you yes you do wrong which means i suppose that you refuse the service which i asked of you you know my theory regarding duels i told you my opinion on that subject if you remember when we were at rome nevertheless my dear count i found you this morning engaged in an occupation but little consistent with the notions you profess to entertain because my dear fellow you understand one must never be eccentric if ones lot is cast among fools it is necessary to study folly i shall perhaps find myself one day called out by some harebrained scamp who has no more real cause of quarrel with me than you have with beauchamp he may take me to task for some foolish trifle or other he will bring his witnesses or will insult me in some public place and i am expected to kill him for all that you admit that you would fight then well if so why do you object to my doing so i do not say that you ought not to fight i only say that a duel is a serious thing and ought not to be undertaken without due reflection did he reflect before he insulted my father if he spoke hastily and owns that he did so you ought to
