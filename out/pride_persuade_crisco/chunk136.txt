children were of very inferior value mary had acquired a little artificial importance by becoming mrs charles musgrove but anne with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding was nobody with either father or sister her word had no weight her convenience was always to give way--she was only anne to lady russell indeed she was a most dear and highly valued god-daughter favourite and friend lady russell loved them all but it was only in anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again a few years before anne elliot had been a very pretty girl but her bloom had vanished early and as even in its height her father had found little to admire in her so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own there could be nothing in them now that she was faded and thin to excite his esteem he had never indulged much hope he had now none of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work all equality of alliance must rest with elizabeth for mary had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large fortune and had therefore given all the honour and received none elizabeth would one day or other marry suitably it sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than she was ten years before and generally speaking if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost it was so with elizabeth still the same handsome miss elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago and sir walter might be excused therefore in forgetting her age or at least be deemed only half a fool for thinking himself and elizabeth as blooming as ever amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing anne haggard mary coarse every face in the neighbourhood worsting and the rapid increase of the crow's foot about lady russell's temples had long been a distress to him elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment thirteen years had seen her mistress of kellynch hall presiding and directing with a self-possession and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was for thirteen years had she been doing the honours and laying down the domestic law at home and leading the way to the chaise and four and walking immediately after lady russell out of all the drawing-rooms and dining-rooms in the country thirteen winters revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms as she travelled up to london with her father for a few weeks annual enjoyment of the great world she had the remembrance of all this she had the consciousness of being nine-and-twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever but she felt her approach to the years of danger and would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet-blood within the next twelvemonth or two then might she again take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth but now she liked it not always to be presented with the date of her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister made the book an evil and more than once when her father had left it open on the table near her had she closed it with averted eyes and pushed it away she had had a disappointment moreover which that book and especially the history of her own family must ever present the remembrance of the heir presumptive the very william walter elliot esq whose rights had been so generously supported by her father had disappointed her she had while a very young girl as soon as she had known him to be in the event of her having no brother the future baronet meant to marry him and her father had always meant that she should he had not been known to them as a boy but soon after lady elliot's death sir walter had sought the acquaintance and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth he had persevered in seeking it making allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth and in one of their spring excursions to london when elizabeth was in her first bloom mr elliot had been forced into the introduction he was at that time a very young man just engaged in the study of the law and elizabeth found him extremely agreeable and every plan in his favour was confirmed he was invited to kellynch hall he was talked of and expected all the rest of the year but he never came the following spring he was seen again in town found equally agreeable again encouraged invited and expected and again he did not come and the next tidings were that he was married instead of pushing his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of elliot he had
