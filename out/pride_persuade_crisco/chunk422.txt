skies delacroixs arabian cavaliers with their long white burnouses their shining belts their damasked arms their horses who tore each other with their teeth while their riders contended fiercely with their maces aquarelles of boulanger representing notre dame de paris with that vigor that makes the artist the rival of the poet there were paintings by diaz who makes his flowers more beautiful than flowers his suns more brilliant than the sun designs by decamp as vividly colored as those of salvator rosa but more poetic pastels by giraud and mller representing children like angels and women with the features of a virgin sketches torn from the album of dauzats travels in the east that had been made in a few seconds on the saddle of a camel or beneath the dome of a mosque in a word all that modern art can give in exchange and as recompense for the art lost and gone with ages long since past albert expected to have something new this time to show to the traveller but to his great surprise the latter without seeking for the signatures many of which indeed were only initials named instantly the author of every picture in such a manner that it was easy to see that each name was not only known to him but that each style associated with it had been appreciated and studied by him from the salon they passed into the bedchamber it was a model of taste and simple elegance a single portrait signed by lopold robert shone in its carved and gilded frame this portrait attracted the count of monte cristos attention for he made three rapid steps in the chamber and stopped suddenly before it it was the portrait of a young woman of five or six-and-twenty with a dark complexion and light and lustrous eyes veiled beneath long lashes she wore the picturesque costume of the catalan fisherwomen a red and black bodice and golden pins in her hair she was looking at the sea and her form was outlined on the blue ocean and sky the light was so faint in the room that albert did not perceive the pallor that spread itself over the counts visage or the nervous heaving of his chest and shoulders silence prevailed for an instant during which monte cristo gazed intently on the picture you have there a most charming mistress viscount said the count in a perfectly calm tone and this costume a ball costume doubtless becomes her admirably ah monsieur returned albert i would never forgive you this mistake if you had seen another picture beside this you do not know my mother she it is whom you see here she had her portrait painted thus six or eight years ago this costume is a fancy one it appears and the resemblance is so great that i think i still see my mother the same as she was in the countess had this portrait painted during the counts absence she doubtless intended giving him an agreeable surprise but strange to say this portrait seemed to displease my father and the value of the picture which is as you see one of the best works of lopold robert could not overcome his dislike to it it is true between ourselves that m de morcerf is one of the most assiduous peers at the luxembourg a general renowned for theory but a most mediocre amateur of art it is different with my mother who paints exceedingly well and who unwilling to part with so valuable a picture gave it to me to put here where it would be less likely to displease m de morcerf whose portrait by gros i will also show you excuse my talking of family matters but as i shall have the honor of introducing you to the count i tell you this to prevent you making any allusions to this picture the picture seems to have a malign influence for my mother rarely comes here without looking at it and still more rarely does she look at it without weeping this disagreement is the only one that has ever taken place between the count and countess who are still as much united although married more than twenty years as on the first day of their wedding m monte cristo glanced rapidly at albert as if to seek a hidden meaning in his words but it was evident the young man uttered them in the simplicity of his heart now said albert that you have seen all my treasures allow me to offer them to you unworthy as they are consider yourself as in your own house and to put yourself still more at your ease pray accompany me to the apartments of m de morcerf he whom i wrote from rome an account of the services you rendered me and to whom i announced your promised visit and i may say that both the count and countess anxiously desire to thank you in person you are somewhat blas i know and family scenes have not much effect on sinbad the sailor who has seen so many others however accept what i propose to you as an initiation into parisian life a life of politeness visiting and introductions monte cristo bowed without making any answer he accepted the offer without enthusiasm and without regret as one of those conventions
