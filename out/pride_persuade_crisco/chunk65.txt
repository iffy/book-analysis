of her deeply-rooted dislike she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a mans affection and though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost all compassion in anger she tried however to compose herself to answer him with patience when he should have done he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer he spoke of apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security such a circumstance could only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly i am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation mr darcy who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature he was struggling for the appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it the pause was to elizabeths feelings dreadful at length with a voice of forced calmness he said and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus rejected but it is of small importance i might as well enquire replied she why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil but i have other provocations you know i have had not my feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister as she pronounced these words mr darcy changed colour but the emotion was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued i have every reason in the world to think ill of you no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability and the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity can you deny that you have done it she repeated with assumed tranquillity he then replied i have no wish of denying that i did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success towards him i have been kinder than towards myself elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate her but it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike is founded long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr wickham on this subject what can you have to say in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others you take an eager interest in that gentlemans concerns said darcy in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him his misfortunes repeated darcy contemptuously yes his misfortunes have been great indeed and of your infliction cried elizabeth with energy you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert you have done all this and yet you can treat the mention of his
