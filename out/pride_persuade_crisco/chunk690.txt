not at all said chteau-renaud slowly i think he is violently agitated he is very susceptible bah said debray he scarcely knew mademoiselle de villefort you said so yourself true still i remember he danced three times with her at madame de morcerfs do you recollect that ball count where you produced such an effect m no i do not replied monte cristo without even knowing of what or to whom he was speaking so much was he occupied in watching morrel who was holding his breath with emotion the discourse is over farewell gentlemen said the count unceremoniously and he disappeared without anyone seeing whither he went the funeral being over the guests returned to paris chteau-renaud looked for a moment for morrel but while they were watching the departure of the count morrel had quitted his post and chteau-renaud failing in his search joined debray and beauchamp monte cristo concealed himself behind a large tomb and awaited the arrival of morrel who by degrees approached the tomb now abandoned by spectators and workmen morrel threw a glance around but before it reached the spot occupied by monte cristo the latter had advanced yet nearer still unperceived the young man knelt down the count with outstretched neck and glaring eyes stood in an attitude ready to pounce upon morrel upon the first occasion morrel bent his head till it touched the stone then clutching the grating with both hands he murmured oh valentine the counts heart was pierced by the utterance of these two words he stepped forward and touching the young mans shoulder said i was looking for you my friend monte cristo expected a burst of passion but he was deceived for morrel turning round said calmly you see i was praying the scrutinizing glance of the count searched the young man from head to foot he then seemed more easy shall i drive you back to paris he asked no thank you do you wish anything leave me to pray the count withdrew without opposition but it was only to place himself in a situation where he could watch every movement of morrel who at length arose brushed the dust from his knees and turned towards paris without once looking back he walked slowly down the rue de la roquette the count dismissing his carriage followed him about a hundred paces behind maximilian crossed the canal and entered the rue meslay by the boulevards five minutes after the door had been closed on morrels entrance it was again opened for the count julie was at the entrance of the garden where she was attentively watching penelon who entering with zeal into his profession of gardener was very busy grafting some bengal roses ah count she exclaimed with the delight manifested by every member of the family whenever he visited the rue meslay maximilian has just returned has he not madame asked the count m yes i think i saw him pass but pray call emmanuel excuse me madame but i must go up to maximilians room this instant replied monte cristo i have something of the greatest importance to tell him go then she said with a charming smile which accompanied him until he had disappeared monte cristo soon ran up the staircase conducting from the ground floor to maximilians room when he reached the landing he listened attentively but all was still like many old houses occupied by a single family the room door was panelled with glass but it was locked maximilian was shut in and it was impossible to see what was passing in the room because a red curtain was drawn before the glass the counts anxiety was manifested by a bright color which seldom appeared on the face of that imperturbable man what shall i do he uttered and reflected for a moment shall i ring no the sound of a bell announcing a visitor will but accelerate the resolution of one in maximilians situation and then the bell would be followed by a louder noise monte cristo trembled from head to foot and as if his determination had been taken with the rapidity of lightning he struck one of the panes of glass with his elbow the glass was shivered to atoms then withdrawing the curtain he saw morrel who had been writing at his desk bound from his seat at the noise of the broken window i beg a thousand pardons said the count there is nothing the matter but i slipped down and broke one of your panes of glass with my elbow since it is opened i will take advantage of it to enter your room do not disturb yourself do not disturb yourself and passing his hand through the broken glass the count opened the door morrel evidently discomposed came to meet monte cristo less with the intention of receiving him than to exclude his entry ma foi said monte cristo rubbing his elbow its all your servants fault your stairs are so polished it is like walking on glass are you hurt sir coldly asked morrel i believe not but what are you about there you were writing i your fingers are stained with ink ah true i was writing i do sometimes soldier though i am monte cristo advanced into the room
