were exaggerated and he was made out one of the most active agents of napoleons return it was evident that at the sight of this document the minister would instantly release him the petition finished villefort read it aloud that will do said he leave the rest to me will the petition go soon today countersigned by you the best thing i can do will be to certify the truth of the contents of your petition and sitting down villefort wrote the certificate at the bottom what more is to be done i will do whatever is necessary this assurance delighted morrel who took leave of villefort and hastened to announce to old dants that he would soon see his son as for villefort instead of sending to paris he carefully preserved the petition that so fearfully compromised dants in the hopes of an event that seemed not unlikely that is a second restoration dants remained a prisoner and heard not the noise of the fall of louis xviiis throne or the still more tragic destruction of the empire twice during the hundred days had morrel renewed his demand and twice had villefort soothed him with promises at last there was waterloo and morrel came no more he had done all that was in his power and any fresh attempt would only compromise himself uselessly louis xviii remounted the throne villefort to whom marseilles had become filled with remorseful memories sought and obtained the situation of kings procureur at toulouse and a fortnight afterwards he married mademoiselle de saint-mran whose father now stood higher at court than ever and so dants after the hundred days and after waterloo remained in his dungeon forgotten of earth and heaven danglars comprehended the full extent of the wretched fate that overwhelmed dants and when napoleon returned to france he after the manner of mediocre minds termed the coincidence a decree of providence but when napoleon returned to paris danglars heart failed him and he lived in constant fear of dants return on a mission of vengeance he therefore informed m morrel of his wish to quit the sea and obtained a recommendation from him to a spanish merchant into whose service he entered at the end of march that is ten or twelve days after napoleons return he then left for madrid and was no more heard of fernand understood nothing except that dants was absent what had become of him he cared not to inquire only during the respite the absence of his rival afforded him he reflected partly on the means of deceiving mercds as to the cause of his absence partly on plans of emigration and abduction as from time to time he sat sad and motionless on the summit of cape pharo at the spot from whence marseilles and the catalans are visible watching for the apparition of a young and handsome man who was for him also the messenger of vengeance fernands mind was made up he would shoot dants and then kill himself but fernand was mistaken a man of his disposition never kills himself for he constantly hopes during this time the empire made its last conscription and every man in france capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the summons of the emperor fernand departed with the rest bearing with him the terrible thought that while he was away his rival would perhaps return and marry mercds had fernand really meant to kill himself he would have done so when he parted from mercds his devotion and the compassion he showed for her misfortunes produced the effect they always produce on noble minds mercds had always had a sincere regard for fernand and this was now strengthened by gratitude my brother said she as she placed his knapsack on his shoulders be careful of yourself for if you are killed i shall be alone in the world these words carried a ray of hope into fernands heart should dants not return mercds might one day be his m mercds was left alone face to face with the vast plain that had never seemed so barren and the sea that had never seemed so vast bathed in tears she wandered about the catalan village sometimes she stood mute and motionless as a statue looking towards marseilles at other times gazing on the sea and debating as to whether it were not better to cast herself into the abyss of the ocean and thus end her woes it was not want of courage that prevented her putting this resolution into execution but her religious feelings came to her aid and saved her caderousse was like fernand enrolled in the army but being married and eight years older he was merely sent to the frontier old dants who was only sustained by hope lost all hope at napoleons downfall five months after he had been separated from his son and almost at the hour of his arrest he breathed his last in mercds arms m morrel paid the expenses of his funeral and a few small debts the poor old man had contracted there was more than benevolence in this action there was courage the south was aflame and to assist even on his death-bed the father of so dangerous a bonapartist as dants was stigmatized as a crime
