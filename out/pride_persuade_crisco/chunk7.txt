far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend mr darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness of this she was perfectly unaware to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with others his doing so drew her notice it was at sir william lucass where a large party were assembled what does mr darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to my conversation with colonel forster that is a question which mr darcy only can answer but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she turned to him and said did not you think mr darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teasing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton with great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic you are severe on us it will be her turn soon to be teased said miss lucas i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows you are a very strange creature by way of a friend always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody if my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers on miss lucass persevering however she added very well if it must be so it must and gravely glancing at mr darcy there is a fine old saying which everybody here is of course familiar with keep your breath to cool your porridge and i shall keep mine to swell my song her performance was pleasing though by no means capital after a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for display mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well and mary at the end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour till sir william thus began what a charming amusement for young people this is mr darcy there is nothing like dancing after all i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies certainly sir and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world every savage can dance sir william only smiled your friend performs delightfully he continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself mr darcy you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight do you often dance at st jamess never sir do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it you have a house in town i conclude mr darcy bowed i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for i am fond of superior
