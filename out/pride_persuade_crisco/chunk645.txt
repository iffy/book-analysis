are going to leave the rue du helder without taking anything with you do not seek to know how i discovered it i know it that is sufficient now listen albert twenty-four years ago i returned proud and joyful to my country i had a betrothed albert a lovely girl whom i adored and i was bringing to my betrothed a hundred and fifty louis painfully amassed by ceaseless toil this money was for her i destined it for her and knowing the treachery of the sea i buried our treasure in the little garden of the house my father lived in at marseilles on the alles de meilhan your mother albert knows that poor house well a short time since i passed through marseilles and went to see the old place which revived so many painful recollections and in the evening i took a spade and dug in the corner of the garden where i had concealed my treasure the iron box was there no one had touched it under a beautiful fig-tree my father had planted the day i was born which overshadowed the spot well albert this money which was formerly designed to promote the comfort and tranquillity of the woman i adored may now through strange and painful circumstances be devoted to the same purpose oh feel for me who could offer millions to that poor woman but who return her only the piece of black bread forgotten under my poor roof since the day i was torn from her i loved you are a generous man albert but perhaps you may be blinded by pride or resentment if you refuse me if you ask another for what i have a right to offer you i will say it is ungenerous of you to refuse the life of your mother at the hands of a man whose father was allowed by your father to die in all the horrors of poverty and despair albert stood pale and motionless to hear what his mother would decide after she had finished reading this letter mercds turned her eyes with an ineffable look towards heaven i accept it said she he has a right to pay the dowry which i shall take with me to some convent putting the letter in her bosom she took her sons arm and with a firmer step than she even herself expected she went downstairs chapter the suicide meanwhile monte cristo had also returned to town with emmanuel and maximilian their return was cheerful emmanuel did not conceal his joy at the peaceful termination of the affair and was loud in his expressions of delight morrel in a corner of the carriage allowed his brother-in-laws gayety to expend itself in words while he felt equal inward joy which however betrayed itself only in his countenance at the barrire du trne they met bertuccio who was waiting there motionless as a sentinel at his post monte cristo put his head out of the window exchanged a few words with him in a low tone and the steward disappeared count said emmanuel when they were at the end of the place royale put me down at my door that my wife may not have a single moment of needless anxiety on my account or yours if it were not ridiculous to make a display of our triumph said morrel i would invite the count to our house besides that he doubtless has some trembling heart to comfort so we will take leave of our friend and let him hasten home stop a moment said monte cristo do not let me lose both my companions return emmanuel to your charming wife and present my best compliments to her and do you morrel accompany me to the champs-lyses willingly said maximilian particularly as i have business in that quarter shall we wait breakfast for you asked emmanuel no replied the young man the door was closed and the carriage proceeded see what good fortune i brought you said morrel when he was alone with the count have you not thought so yes said monte cristo for that reason i wished to keep you near me it is miraculous continued morrel answering his own thoughts what said monte cristo what has just happened yes said the count you are right it is miraculous for albert is brave resumed morrel very brave said monte cristo i have seen him sleep with a sword suspended over his head and i know he has fought two duels said morrel how can you reconcile that with his conduct this morning all owing to your influence replied monte cristo smiling it is well for albert he is not in the army said morrel why an apology on the ground said the young captain shaking his head come said the count mildly do not entertain the prejudices of ordinary men morrel acknowledge that if albert is brave he cannot be a coward he must then have had some reason for acting as he did this morning and confess that his conduct is more heroic than otherwise doubtless doubtless said morrel but i shall say like the spaniard he has not been so brave today as he was yesterday you will breakfast with me will you not morrel said the count to turn the conversation no i must leave you at ten oclock your engagement was for
