in the art of shipbuilding the spectators followed the little vessel with their eyes as long as it remained visible they then turned their conjectures upon her probable destination some insisted she was making for corsica others the island of elba bets were offered to any amount that she was bound for spain while africa was positively reported by many persons as her intended course but no one thought of monte cristo yet thither it was that dants guided his vessel and at monte cristo he arrived at the close of the second day his boat had proved herself a first-class sailor and had come the distance from genoa in thirty-five hours dants had carefully noted the general appearance of the shore and instead of landing at the usual place he dropped anchor in the little creek the island was utterly deserted and bore no evidence of having been visited since he went away his treasure was just as he had left it early on the following morning he commenced the removal of his riches and ere nightfall the whole of his immense wealth was safely deposited in the compartments of the secret locker a week passed by dants employed it in manuvring his yacht round the island studying it as a skilful horseman would the animal he destined for some important service till at the end of that time he was perfectly conversant with its good and bad qualities the former dants proposed to augment the latter to remedy upon the eighth day he discerned a small vessel under full sail approaching monte cristo as it drew near he recognized it as the boat he had given to jacopo he immediately signalled it his signal was returned and in two hours afterwards the new-comer lay at anchor beside the yacht a mournful answer awaited each of edmonds eager inquiries as to the information jacopo had obtained old dants was dead and mercds had disappeared dants listened to these melancholy tidings with outward calmness but leaping lightly ashore he signified his desire to be quite alone in a couple of hours he returned two of the men from jacopos boat came on board the yacht to assist in navigating it and he gave orders that she should be steered direct to marseilles for his fathers death he was in some manner prepared but he knew not how to account for the mysterious disappearance of mercds without divulging his secret dants could not give sufficiently clear instructions to an agent there were besides other particulars he was desirous of ascertaining and those were of a nature he alone could investigate in a manner satisfactory to himself his looking-glass had assured him during his stay at leghorn that he ran no risk of recognition moreover he had now the means of adopting any disguise he thought proper one fine morning then his yacht followed by the little fishing-boat boldly entered the port of marseilles and anchored exactly opposite the spot from whence on the never-to-be-forgotten night of his departure for the chteau dif he had been put on board the boat destined to convey him thither m still dants could not view without a shudder the approach of a gendarme who accompanied the officers deputed to demand his bill of health ere the yacht was permitted to hold communication with the shore but with that perfect self-possession he had acquired during his acquaintance with faria dants coolly presented an english passport he had obtained from leghorn and as this gave him a standing which a french passport would not have afforded he was informed that there existed no obstacle to his immediate debarkation the first person to attract the attention of dants as he landed on the canebire was one of the crew belonging to the pharaon edmond welcomed the meeting with this fellow who had been one of his own sailors as a sure means of testing the extent of the change which time had worked in his own appearance going straight towards him he propounded a variety of questions on different subjects carefully watching the mans countenance as he did so but not a word or look implied that he had the slightest idea of ever having seen before the person with whom he was then conversing giving the sailor a piece of money in return for his civility dants proceeded onwards but ere he had gone many steps he heard the man loudly calling him to stop dants instantly turned to meet him i beg your pardon sir said the honest fellow in almost breathless haste but i believe you made a mistake you intended to give me a two-franc piece and see you gave me a double napoleon thank you my good friend i see that i have made a trifling mistake as you say but by way of rewarding your honesty i give you another double napoleon that you may drink to my health and be able to ask your messmates to join you so extreme was the surprise of the sailor that he was unable even to thank edmond whose receding figure he continued to gaze after in speechless astonishment some nabob from india was his comment dants meanwhile went on his way each step he trod oppressed his heart with fresh emotion his first and most indelible recollections were there not a tree not a street that
