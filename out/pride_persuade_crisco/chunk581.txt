i own which instead of wounding sheathe their points in their own handles but daggers which he nevertheless believed to be real and deadly jealousy indicates affection true but i am not jealous he is of whom of debray no of you of me i will engage to say that before a week is past the door will be closed against me you are mistaken my dear viscount prove it to me do you wish me to do so yes well i am charged with the commission of endeavoring to induce the comte de morcerf to make some definite arrangement with the baron by whom are you charged by the baron himself oh said albert with all the cajolery of which he was capable you surely will not do that my dear count certainly i shall albert as i have promised to do it well said albert with a sigh it seems you are determined to marry me i am determined to try and be on good terms with everybody at all events said monte cristo but apropos of debray how is it that i have not seen him lately at the barons house there has been a misunderstanding what with the baroness no with the baron has he perceived anything ah that is a good joke do you think he suspects said monte cristo with charming artlessness where have you come from my dear count said albert from congo if you will it must be farther off than even that but what do i know of your parisian husbands oh my dear count husbands are pretty much the same everywhere an individual husband of any country is a pretty fair specimen of the whole race but then what can have led to the quarrel between danglars and debray they seemed to understand each other so well said monte cristo with renewed energy ah now you are trying to penetrate into the mysteries of isis in which i am not initiated when m andrea cavalcanti has become one of the family you can ask him that question the carriage stopped here we are said monte cristo it is only half-past ten oclock come in certainly i will my carriage shall take you back no thank you i gave orders for my coup to follow me there it is then said monte cristo as he stepped out of the carriage they both went into the house the drawing-room was lighted up they went in there you will make tea for us baptistin said the count baptistin left the room without waiting to answer and in two seconds reappeared bringing on a tray all that his master had ordered ready prepared and appearing to have sprung from the ground like the repasts which we read of in fairy tales really my dear count said morcerf what i admire in you is not so much your riches for perhaps there are people even wealthier than yourself nor is it only your wit for beaumarchais might have possessed as much but it is your manner of being served without any questions in a moment in a second it is as if they guessed what you wanted by your manner of ringing and made a point of keeping everything you can possibly desire in constant readiness what you say is perhaps true they know my habits for instance you shall see how do you wish to occupy yourself during tea-time ma foi i should like to smoke monte cristo took the gong and struck it once in about the space of a second a private door opened and ali appeared bringing two chibouques filled with excellent latakia it is quite wonderful said albert oh no it is as simple as possible replied monte cristo ali knows i generally smoke while i am taking my tea or coffee he has heard that i ordered tea and he also knows that i brought you home with me when i summoned him he naturally guessed the reason of my doing so and as he comes from a country where hospitality is especially manifested through the medium of smoking he naturally concludes that we shall smoke in company and therefore brings two chibouques instead of one and now the mystery is solved certainly you give a most commonplace air to your explanation but it is not the less true that you ah but what do i hear and morcerf inclined his head towards the door through which sounds seemed to issue resembling those of a guitar ma foi my dear viscount you are fated to hear music this evening you have only escaped from mademoiselle danglars piano to be attacked by haydes guzla hayde what an adorable name are there then really women who bear the name of hayde anywhere but in byrons poems certainly there are hayde is a very uncommon name in france but is common enough in albania and epirus it is as if you said for example chastity modesty innocence it is a kind of baptismal name as you parisians call it oh that is charming said albert how i should like to hear my countrywomen called mademoiselle goodness mademoiselle silence mademoiselle christian charity only think then if mademoiselle danglars instead of being called claire-marie-eugnie had been named mademoiselle chastity-modesty-innocence danglars what a fine effect that would have produced on the announcement of her marriage hush said
