seen with him anywhere mr elliot and his friends in marlborough buildings were talked of the whole evening colonel wallis had been so impatient to be introduced to them and mr elliot so anxious that he should and there was a mrs wallis at present known only to them by description as she was in daily expectation of her confinement but mr elliot spoke of her as a most charming woman quite worthy of being known in camden place and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted sir walter thought much of mrs wallis she was said to be an excessively pretty woman beautiful he longed to see her he hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces he was continually passing in the streets the worst of bath was the number of its plain women he did not mean to say that there were no pretty women but the number of the plain was out of all proportion he had frequently observed as he walked that one handsome face would be followed by thirty or five-and-thirty frights and once as he had stood in a shop on bond street he had counted eighty-seven women go by one after another without there being a tolerable face among them it had been a frosty morning to be sure a sharp frost which hardly one woman in a thousand could stand the test of but still there certainly were a dreadful multitude of ugly women in bath and as for the men they were infinitely worse such scarecrows as the streets were full of it was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything tolerable by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced he had never walked anywhere arm-in-arm with colonel wallis who was a fine military figure though sandy-haired without observing that every womans eye was upon him every womans eye was sure to be upon colonel wallis modest sir walter he was not allowed to escape however his daughter and mrs clay united in hinting that colonel walliss companion might have as good a figure as colonel wallis and certainly was not sandy-haired how is mary looking said sir walter in the height of his good humour the last time i saw her she had a red nose but i hope that may not happen every day oh no that must have been quite accidental in general she has been in very good health and very good looks since michaelmas if i thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds and grow coarse i would send her a new hat and pelisse anne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown or a cap would not be liable to any such misuse when a knock at the door suspended everything a knock at the door and so late it was ten oclock could it be mr elliot they knew he was to dine in lansdown crescent it was possible that he might stop in his way home to ask them how they did they could think of no one else mrs clay decidedly thought it mr elliots knock mrs clay was right with all the state which a butler and foot-boy could give mr elliot was ushered into the room it was the same the very same man with no difference but of dress anne drew a little back while the others received his compliments and her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour but he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she nor her friend had taken cold the day before c c which was all as politely done and as politely taken as possible but her part must follow then sir walter talked of his youngest daughter mr elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter there was no occasion for remembering mary and anne smiling and blushing very becomingly shewed to mr elliot the pretty features which he had by no means forgotten and instantly saw with amusement at his little start of surprise that he had not been at all aware of who she was he looked completely astonished but not more astonished than pleased his eyes brightened and with the most perfect alacrity he welcomed the relationship alluded to the past and entreated to be received as an acquaintance already he was quite as good-looking as he had appeared at lyme his countenance improved by speaking and his manners were so exactly what they ought to be so polished so easy so particularly agreeable that she could compare them in excellence to only one persons manners they were not the same but they were perhaps equally good he sat down with them and improved their conversation very much there could be no doubt of his being a sensible man ten minutes were enough to certify that his tone his expressions his choice of subject his knowing where to stop it was all the operation of a sensible discerning mind as soon as he could he began to talk to her of lyme wanting to compare opinions respecting the place but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance of their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time to give his own
