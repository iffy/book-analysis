on the narrator then with head bent down and hands clasped or rather clenched together he prepared to give his whole attention to caderousse who seated himself on the little stool exactly opposite to him remember this is no affair of mine said the trembling voice of la carconte as though through the flooring of her chamber she viewed the scene that was enacting below enough enough replied caderousse say no more about it i will take all the consequences upon myself and he began his story chapter the story first sir said caderousse you must make me a promise what is that inquired the abb why if you ever make use of the details i am about to give you that you will never let anyone know that it was i who supplied them for the persons of whom i am about to talk are rich and powerful and if they only laid the tips of their fingers on me i should break to pieces like glass make yourself easy my friend replied the abb i am a priest and confessions die in my breast recollect our only desire is to carry out in a fitting manner the last wishes of our friend speak then without reserve as without hatred tell the truth the whole truth i do not know never may know the persons of whom you are about to speak besides i am an italian and not a frenchman and belong to god and not to man and i shall shortly retire to my convent which i have only quitted to fulfil the last wishes of a dying man this positive assurance seemed to give caderousse a little courage well then under these circumstances said caderousse i will i even believe i ought to undeceive you as to the friendship which poor edmond thought so sincere and unquestionable begin with his father if you please said the abb edmond talked to me a great deal about the old man for whom he had the deepest love the history is a sad one sir said caderousse shaking his head perhaps you know all the earlier part of it yes answered the abb edmond related to me everything until the moment when he was arrested in a small cabaret close to marseilles at la rserve oh yes i can see it all before me this moment was it not his betrothal feast it was and the feast that began so gayly had a very sorrowful ending a police commissary followed by four soldiers entered and dants was arrested yes and up to this point i know all said the priest dants himself only knew that which personally concerned him for he never beheld again the five persons i have named to you or heard mention of anyone of them well when dants was arrested monsieur morrel hastened to obtain the particulars and they were very sad the old man returned alone to his home folded up his wedding suit with tears in his eyes and paced up and down his chamber the whole day and would not go to bed at all for i was underneath him and heard him walking the whole night and for myself i assure you i could not sleep either for the grief of the poor father gave me great uneasiness and every step he took went to my heart as really as if his foot had pressed against my breast the next day mercds came to implore the protection of m de villefort she did not obtain it however and went to visit the old man when she saw him so miserable and heart-broken having passed a sleepless night and not touched food since the previous day she wished him to go with her that she might take care of him but the old man would not consent no was the old mans reply i will not leave this house for my poor dear boy loves me better than anything in the world and if he gets out of prison he will come and see me the first thing and what would he think if i did not wait here for him i heard all this from the window for i was anxious that mercds should persuade the old man to accompany her for his footsteps over my head night and day did not leave me a moments repose but did you not go upstairs and try to console the poor old man asked the abb ah sir replied caderousse we cannot console those who will not be consoled and he was one of these besides i know not why but he seemed to dislike seeing me one night however i heard his sobs and i could not resist my desire to go up to him but when i reached his door he was no longer weeping but praying i cannot now repeat to you sir all the eloquent words and imploring language he made use of it was more than piety it was more than grief and i who am no canter and hate the jesuits said then to myself it is really well and i am very glad that i have not any children for if i were a father and felt such excessive grief as the old man does and did not find in my memory or heart all he is now
