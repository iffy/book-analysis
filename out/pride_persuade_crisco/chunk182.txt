wish he may be induced to call here and when he does mary you may depend upon hearing my opinion but i am determined not to judge him beforehand you will not like him i will answer for it lady russell began talking of something else mary spoke with animation of their meeting with or rather missing mr elliot so extraordinarily he is a man said lady russell whom i have no wish to see his declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me this decision checked mary's eagerness and stopped her short in the midst of the elliot countenance with regard to captain wentworth though anne hazarded no enquiries there was voluntary communication sufficient his spirits had been greatly recovering lately as might be expected as louisa improved he had improved and he was now quite a different creature from what he had been the first week he had not seen louisa and was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her from an interview that he did not press for it at all and on the contrary seemed to have a plan of going away for a week or ten days till her head was stronger he had talked of going down to plymouth for a week and wanted to persuade captain benwick to go with him but as charles maintained to the last captain benwick seemed much more disposed to ride over to kellynch there can be no doubt that lady russell and anne were both occasionally thinking of captain benwick from this time lady russell could not hear the door-bell without feeling that it might be his herald nor could anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in her father's grounds or any visit of charity in the village without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him captain benwick came not however he was either less disposed for it than charles had imagined or he was too shy and after giving him a week's indulgence lady russell determined him to be unworthy of the interest which he had been beginning to excite the musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school bringing with them mrs harville's little children to improve the noise of uppercross and lessen that of lyme henrietta remained with louisa but all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters lady russell and anne paid their compliments to them once when anne could not but feel that uppercross was already quite alive again though neither henrietta nor louisa nor charles hayter nor captain wentworth were there the room presented as strong a contrast as could be wished to the last state she had seen it in immediately surrounding mrs musgrove were the little harvilles whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from the cottage expressly arrived to amuse them on one side was a table occupied by some chattering girls cutting up silk and gold paper and on the other were tressels and trays bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies where riotous boys were holding high revel the whole completed by a roaring christmas fire which seemed determined to be heard in spite of all the noise of the others charles and mary also came in of course during their visit and mr musgrove made a point of paying his respects to lady russell and sat down close to her for ten minutes talking with a very raised voice but from the clamour of the children on his knees generally in vain it was a fine family-piece anne judging from her own temperament would have deemed such a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves which louisa's illness must have so greatly shaken but mrs musgrove who got anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially again and again for all her attentions to them concluded a short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing with a happy glance round the room that after all she had gone through nothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness at home louisa was now recovering apace her mother could even think of her being able to join their party at home before her brothers and sisters went to school again the harvilles had promised to come with her and stay at uppercross whenever she returned captain wentworth was gone for the present to see his brother in shropshire i hope i shall remember in future said lady russell as soon as they were reseated in the carriage not to call at uppercross in the christmas holidays everybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters and sounds are quite innoxious or most distressing by their sort rather than their quantity when lady russell not long afterwards was entering bath on a wet afternoon and driving through the long course of streets from the old bridge to camden place amidst the dash of other carriages the heavy rumble of carts and drays the bawling of newspapermen muffin-men and milkmen and the ceaseless clink of pattens she made no complaint no these were noises which belonged to the winter pleasures her spirits rose under their influence and like mrs musgrove she
