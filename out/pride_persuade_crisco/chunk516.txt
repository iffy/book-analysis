is impossible i agree with m de villefort said monte cristo fixing his eyes on madame de villefort and if i were sufficiently intimate with him to allow of giving my advice i would persuade him since i have been told m dpinay is coming back to settle this affair at once beyond all possibility of revocation i will answer for the success of a project which will reflect so much honor on m de villefort the procureur arose delighted with the proposition but his wife slightly changed color well that is all that i wanted and i will be guided by a counsellor such as you are said he extending his hand to monte cristo therefore let everyone here look upon what has passed today as if it had not happened and as though we had never thought of such a thing as a change in our original plans sir said the count the world unjust as it is will be pleased with your resolution your friends will be proud of you and m dpinay even if he took mademoiselle de villefort without any dowry which he will not do would be delighted with the idea of entering a family which could make such sacrifices in order to keep a promise and fulfil a duty at the conclusion of these words the count rose to depart are you going to leave us count said madame de villefort i am sorry to say i must do so madame i only came to remind you of your promise for saturday did you fear that we should forget it you are very good madame but m de villefort has so many important and urgent occupations my husband has given me his word sir said madame de villefort you have just seen him resolve to keep it when he has everything to lose and surely there is more reason for his doing so where he has everything to gain and said villefort is it at your house in the champs-lyses that you receive your visitors no said monte cristo which is precisely the reason which renders your kindness more meritorious it is in the country in the country yes where is it then near paris is it not very near only half a league from the barriers it is at auteuil at auteuil said villefort true madame de villefort told me you lived at auteuil since it was to your house that she was taken and in what part of auteuil do you reside rue de la fontaine rue de la fontaine exclaimed villefort in an agitated tone at what number no then cried villefort was it you who bought m de saint-mrans house did it belong to m de saint-mran demanded monte cristo yes replied madame de villefort and would you believe it count believe what you think this house pretty do you not i think it charming well my husband would never live in it indeed returned monte cristo that is a prejudice on your part m de villefort for which i am quite at a loss to account i do not like auteuil sir said the procureur making an evident effort to appear calm but i hope you will not carry your antipathy so far as to deprive me of the pleasure of your company sir said monte cristo no count i hope i assure you i shall do my best stammered villefort oh said monte cristo i allow of no excuse on saturday at six oclock i shall be expecting you and if you fail to come i shall think for how do i know to the contrary that this house which has remained uninhabited for twenty years must have some gloomy tradition or dreadful legend connected with it i will come count i will be sure to come said villefort eagerly thank you said monte cristo now you must permit me to take my leave of you you said before that you were obliged to leave us monsieur said madame de villefort and you were about to tell us why when your attention was called to some other subject indeed madame said monte cristo i scarcely know if i dare tell you where i am going nonsense say on well then it is to see a thing on which i have sometimes mused for hours together what is it a telegraph so now i have told my secret a telegraph repeated madame de villefort yes a telegraph i had often seen one placed at the end of a road on a hillock and in the light of the sun its black arms bending in every direction always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle and i assure you it was never without emotion that i gazed on it for i could not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should be made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the distance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting at a table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at the opposite extremity and all this effected by a simple act of volition on the part of the sender of the message i began to think of genii sylphs gnomes in short of all the ministers of the occult sciences until i laughed
