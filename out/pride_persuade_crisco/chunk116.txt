one glance at darcy he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at pemberley but perhaps he could not in her mothers presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt it was a painful but not an improbable conjecture bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed he was received by mrs bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied darcy after enquiring of her how mr and mrs gardiner did a question which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely anything he was not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence but it had not been so in derbyshire there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but the ground more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so could i expect it to be otherwise said she yet why did he come she was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself and to him she had hardly courage to speak she enquired after his sister but could do no more it is a long time mr bingley since you went away said mrs bennet he readily agreed to it i began to be afraid you would never come back again people did say you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas but however i hope it is not true a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away miss lucas is married and settled and one of my own daughters i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have seen it in the papers it was in the times and the courier i know though it was not put in as it ought to be it was only said lately george wickham esq to miss lydia bennet without there being a syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or anything it was my brother gardiners drawing up too and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it did you see it bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes how mr darcy looked therefore she could not tell it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married continued her mother but at the same time mr bingley it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me they are gone down to newcastle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stay i do not know how long his regiment is there for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the regulars thank heaven he has some friends though perhaps not so many as he deserves elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at mr darcy was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat it drew from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually done before and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present a few weeks he believed when you have killed all your own birds mr bingley said her mother i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr bennets manor i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you and will save all the best of the covies for you elizabeths misery increased at such unnecessary such officious attention were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion at that instant she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to be in company with either of them their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this let me never see either one or the other again yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover when first he came in he had spoken to her but little but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention he found her as handsome as she had been last year as good natured
