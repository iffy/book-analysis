of you i was about to offer myself sir said the priest it is our mission to forestall our duties it is a young girl i know it sir the servants who fled from the house informed me i also know that her name is valentine and i have already prayed for her thank you sir said davrigny since you have commenced your sacred office deign to continue it come and watch by the dead and all the wretched family will be grateful to you i am going sir and i do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be more fervent than mine davrigny took the priests hand and without meeting villefort who was engaged in his study they reached valentines room which on the following night was to be occupied by the undertakers on entering the room noirtiers eyes met those of the abb and no doubt he read some particular expression in them for he remained in the room davrigny recommended the attention of the priest to the living as well as to the dead and the abb promised to devote his prayers to valentine and his attentions to noirtier in order doubtless that he might not be disturbed while fulfilling his sacred mission the priest rose as soon as davrigny departed and not only bolted the door through which the doctor had just left but also that leading to madame de villeforts room chapter danglars signature the next morning dawned dull and cloudy during the night the undertakers had executed their melancholy office and wrapped the corpse in the winding-sheet which whatever may be said about the equality of death is at least a last proof of the luxury so pleasing in life this winding-sheet was nothing more than a beautiful piece of cambric which the young girl had bought a fortnight before during the evening two men engaged for the purpose had carried noirtier from valentines room into his own and contrary to all expectation there was no difficulty in withdrawing him from his child the abb busoni had watched till daylight and then left without calling anyone davrigny returned about eight oclock in the morning he met villefort on his way to noirtiers room and accompanied him to see how the old man had slept they found him in the large armchair which served him for a bed enjoying a calm nay almost a smiling sleep they both stood in amazement at the door see said davrigny to villefort nature knows how to alleviate the deepest sorrow no one can say that m noirtier did not love his child and yet he sleeps yes you are right replied villefort surprised he sleeps indeed and this is the more strange since the least contradiction keeps him awake all night grief has stunned him replied davrigny and they both returned thoughtfully to the procureurs study see i have not slept said villefort showing his undisturbed bed grief does not stun me i have not been in bed for two nights but then look at my desk see what i have written during these two days and nights i have filled those papers and have made out the accusation against the assassin benedetto oh work work my passion my joy my delight it is for thee to alleviate my sorrows and he convulsively grasped the hand of davrigny do you require my services now asked davrigny no said villefort only return again at eleven oclock at twelve the the oh heavens my poor poor child and the procureur again becoming a man lifted up his eyes and groaned shall you be present in the reception-room no i have a cousin who has undertaken this sad office i shall work doctor when i work i forget everything and indeed no sooner had the doctor left the room than he was again absorbed in work on the doorsteps davrigny met the cousin whom villefort had mentioned a personage as insignificant in our story as in the world he occupied one of those beings designed from their birth to make themselves useful to others he was punctual dressed in black with crape around his hat and presented himself at his cousins with a face made up for the occasion and which he could alter as might be required at eleven oclock the mourning-coaches rolled into the paved court and the rue du faubourg saint-honor was filled with a crowd of idlers equally pleased to witness the festivities or the mourning of the rich and who rush with the same avidity to a funeral procession as to the marriage of a duchess gradually the reception-room filled and some of our old friends made their appearance we mean debray chteau-renaud and beauchamp accompanied by all the leading men of the day at the bar in literature or the army for m de villefort moved in the first parisian circles less owing to his social position than to his personal merit the cousin standing at the door ushered in the guests and it was rather a relief to the indifferent to see a person as unmoved as themselves and who did not exact a mournful face or force tears as would have been the case with a father a brother or a lover those who were acquainted soon formed into little groups one of them was made of debray chteau-renaud and beauchamp poor girl
