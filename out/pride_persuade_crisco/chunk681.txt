saw davrigny curiously examining the glass which she felt certain of having emptied during the night it was now a third full just as it was when she threw the contents into the ashes the spectre of valentine rising before the poisoner would have alarmed her less it was indeed the same color as the draught she had poured into the glass and which valentine had drunk it was indeed the poison which could not deceive m davrigny which he now examined so closely it was doubtless a miracle from heaven that notwithstanding her precautions there should be some trace some proof remaining to reveal the crime while madame de villefort remained rooted to the spot like a statue of terror and villefort with his head hidden in the bedclothes saw nothing around him davrigny approached the window that he might the better examine the contents of the glass and dipping the tip of his finger in tasted it ah he exclaimed it is no longer brucine that is used let me see what it is then he ran to one of the cupboards in valentines room which had been transformed into a medicine closet and taking from its silver case a small bottle of nitric acid dropped a little of it into the liquor which immediately changed to a blood-red color ah exclaimed davrigny in a voice in which the horror of a judge unveiling the truth was mingled with the delight of a student making a discovery madame de villefort was overpowered her eyes first flashed and then swam she staggered towards the door and disappeared directly afterwards the distant sound of a heavy weight falling on the ground was heard but no one paid any attention to it the nurse was engaged in watching the chemical analysis and villefort was still absorbed in grief m davrigny alone had followed madame de villefort with his eyes and watched her hurried retreat he lifted up the drapery over the entrance to edwards room and his eye reaching as far as madame de villeforts apartment he beheld her extended lifeless on the floor go to the assistance of madame de villefort he said to the nurse madame de villefort is ill m but mademoiselle de villefort stammered the nurse mademoiselle de villefort no longer requires help said davrigny since she is dead dead dead groaned forth villefort in a paroxysm of grief which was the more terrible from the novelty of the sensation in the iron heart of that man dead repeated a third voice who said valentine was dead the two men turned round and saw morrel standing at the door pale and terror-stricken this is what had happened at the usual time morrel had presented himself at the little door leading to noirtiers room contrary to custom the door was open and having no occasion to ring he entered he waited for a moment in the hall and called for a servant to conduct him to m noirtier but no one answered the servants having as we know deserted the house morrel had no particular reason for uneasiness monte cristo had promised him that valentine should live and so far he had always fulfilled his word every night the count had given him news which was the next morning confirmed by noirtier still this extraordinary silence appeared strange to him and he called a second and third time still no answer then he determined to go up noirtiers room was opened like all the rest the first thing he saw was the old man sitting in his armchair in his usual place but his eyes expressed alarm which was confirmed by the pallor which overspread his features how are you sir asked morrel with a sickness of heart well answered the old man by closing his eyes but his appearance manifested increasing uneasiness you are thoughtful sir continued morrel you want something shall i call one of the servants yes replied noirtier morrel pulled the bell but though he nearly broke the cord no one answered he turned towards noirtier the pallor and anguish expressed on his countenance momentarily increased oh exclaimed morrel why do they not come is anyone ill in the house the eyes of noirtier seemed as though they would start from their sockets what is the matter you alarm me valentine valentine yes yes signed noirtier maximilian tried to speak but he could articulate nothing he staggered and supported himself against the wainscot then he pointed to the door yes yes yes continued the old man m maximilian rushed up the little staircase while noirtiers eyes seemed to say quicker quicker in a minute the young man darted through several rooms till at length he reached valentines there was no occasion to push the door it was wide open a sob was the only sound he heard he saw as though in a mist a black figure kneeling and buried in a confused mass of white drapery a terrible fear transfixed him it was then he heard a voice exclaim valentine is dead and another voice which like an echo repeated dead dead m chapter maximilian villefort rose half-ashamed of being surprised in such a paroxysm of grief the terrible office he had held for twenty-five years had succeeded in making him more or less than man his glance at first wandering fixed itself upon morrel
