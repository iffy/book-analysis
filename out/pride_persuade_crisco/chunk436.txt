had been to lucca to take in oil to leghorn for english cottons and we ran our cargo without opposition and returned home full of joy when i entered the house the first thing i beheld in the middle of assuntas chamber was a cradle that might be called sumptuous compared with the rest of the furniture and in it a baby seven or eight months old i uttered a cry of joy the only moments of sadness i had known since the assassination of the procureur were caused by the recollection that i had abandoned this child for the assassination itself i had never felt any remorse poor assunta had guessed all she had profited by my absence and furnished with the half of the linen and having written down the day and hour at which i had deposited the child at the asylum had set off for paris and had reclaimed it no objection was raised and the infant was given up to her ah i confess your excellency when i saw this poor creature sleeping peacefully in its cradle i felt my eyes filled with tears ah assunta cried i you are an excellent woman and heaven will bless you this said monte cristo is less correct than your philosophy it is only faith alas your excellency is right replied bertuccio and god made this infant the instrument of our punishment never did a perverse nature declare itself more prematurely and yet it was not owing to any fault in his bringing up he was a most lovely child with large blue eyes of that deep color that harmonizes so well with the blond complexion only his hair which was too light gave his face a most singular expression and added to the vivacity of his look and the malice of his smile unfortunately there is a proverb which says that red is either altogether good or altogether bad the proverb was but too correct as regarded benedetto and even in his infancy he manifested the worst disposition it is true that the indulgence of his foster-mother encouraged him this child for whom my poor sister would go to the town five or six leagues off to purchase the earliest fruits and the most tempting sweetmeats preferred to palma grapes or genoese preserves the chestnuts stolen from a neighbors orchard or the dried apples in his loft when he could eat as well of the nuts and apples that grew in my garden one day when benedetto was about five or six our neighbor wasilio who according to the custom of the country never locked up his purse or his valuables for as your excellency knows there are no thieves in corsica complained that he had lost a louis out of his purse we thought he must have made a mistake in counting his money but he persisted in the accuracy of his statement one day benedetto who had been gone from the house since morning to our great anxiety did not return until late in the evening dragging a monkey after him which he said he had found chained to the foot of a tree for more than a month past the mischievous child who knew not what to wish for had taken it into his head to have a monkey a boatman who had passed by rogliano and who had several of these animals whose tricks had greatly diverted him had doubtless suggested this idea to him monkeys are not found in our woods chained to trees said i confess how you obtained this animal benedetto maintained the truth of what he had said and accompanied it with details that did more honor to his imagination than to his veracity i became angry he began to laugh i threatened to strike him and he made two steps backwards you cannot beat me said he you have no right for you are not my father m we never knew who had revealed this fatal secret which we had so carefully concealed from him however it was this answer in which the childs whole character revealed itself that almost terrified me and my arm fell without touching him the boy triumphed and this victory rendered him so audacious that all the money of assunta whose affection for him seemed to increase as he became more unworthy of it was spent in caprices she knew not how to contend against and follies she had not the courage to prevent when i was at rogliano everything went on properly but no sooner was my back turned than benedetto became master and everything went ill when he was only eleven he chose his companions from among the young men of eighteen or twenty the worst characters in bastia or indeed in corsica and they had already for some mischievous pranks been several times threatened with a prosecution i became alarmed as any prosecution might be attended with serious consequences i was compelled at this period to leave corsica on an important expedition i reflected for a long time and with the hope of averting some impending misfortune i resolved that benedetto should accompany me i hoped that the active and laborious life of a smuggler with the severe discipline on board would have a salutary effect on his character which was now well-nigh if not quite corrupt i spoke to benedetto alone
