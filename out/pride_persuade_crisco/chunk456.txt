she and to whom am i indebted for so happy a termination to my late dreadful alarm madame answered the count you are under the roof of one who esteems himself most fortunate in having been able to save you from a further continuance of your sufferings my wretched curiosity has brought all this about pursued the lady all paris rung with the praises of madame danglars beautiful horses and i had the folly to desire to know whether they really merited the high praise given to them is it possible exclaimed the count with well-feigned astonishment that these horses belong to the baroness they do indeed may i inquire if you are acquainted with madame danglars m i have that honor and my happiness at your escape from the danger that threatened you is redoubled by the consciousness that i have been the unwilling and the unintentional cause of all the peril you have incurred i yesterday purchased these horses of the baron but as the baroness evidently regretted parting with them i ventured to send them back to her with a request that she would gratify me by accepting them from my hands you are then doubtless the count of monte cristo of whom hermine has talked to me so much you have rightly guessed madame replied the count and i am madame hlose de villefort the count bowed with the air of a person who hears a name for the first time how grateful will m de villefort be for all your goodness how thankfully will he acknowledge that to you alone he owes the existence of his wife and child most certainly but for the prompt assistance of your intrepid servant this dear child and myself must both have perished indeed i still shudder at the fearful danger you were placed in i trust you will allow me to recompense worthily the devotion of your man i beseech you madame replied monte cristo not to spoil ali either by too great praise or rewards i cannot allow him to acquire the habit of expecting to be recompensed for every trifling service he may render ali is my slave and in saving your life he was but discharging his duty to me nay interposed madame de villefort on whom the authoritative style adopted by the count made a deep impression nay but consider that to preserve my life he has risked his own his life madame belongs not to him it is mine in return for my having myself saved him from death madame de villefort made no further reply her mind was utterly absorbed in the contemplation of the person who from the first instant she saw him had made so powerful an impression on her during the evident preoccupation of madame de villefort monte cristo scrutinized the features and appearance of the boy she kept folded in her arms lavishing on him the most tender endearments the child was small for his age and unnaturally pale a mass of straight black hair defying all attempts to train or curl it fell over his projecting forehead and hung down to his shoulders giving increased vivacity to eyes already sparkling with a youthful love of mischief and fondness for every forbidden enjoyment his mouth was large and the lips which had not yet regained their color were particularly thin in fact the deep and crafty look giving a predominant expression to the childs face belonged rather to a boy of twelve or fourteen than to one so young his first movement was to free himself by a violent push from the encircling arms of his mother and to rush forward to the casket from whence the count had taken the phial of elixir then without asking permission of anyone he proceeded in all the wilfulness of a spoiled child unaccustomed to restrain either whims or caprices to pull the corks out of all the bottles touch nothing my little friend cried the count eagerly some of those liquids are not only dangerous to taste but even to inhale madame de villefort became very pale and seizing her sons arm drew him anxiously toward her but once satisfied of his safety she also cast a brief but expressive glance on the casket which was not lost upon the count at this moment ali entered at sight of him madame de villefort uttered an expression of pleasure and holding the child still closer towards her she said edward dearest do you see that good man he has shown very great courage and resolution for he exposed his own life to stop the horses that were running away with us and would certainly have dashed the carriage to pieces thank him then my child in your very best manner for had he not come to our aid neither you nor i would have been alive to speak our thanks the child stuck out his lips and turned away his head in a disdainful manner saying hes too ugly m the count smiled as if the child bade fair to realize his hopes while madame de villefort reprimanded her son with a gentleness and moderation very far from conveying the least idea of a fault having been committed this lady said the count speaking to ali in the arabic language is desirous that her son should thank you for saving both their lives
