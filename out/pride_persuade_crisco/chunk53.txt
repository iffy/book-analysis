why should we her not objecting does not justify him it only shows her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling well cried elizabeth have it as you choose he shall be mercenary and she shall be foolish no lizzy that is what i do not choose i should be sorry you know to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire oh if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better i am sick of them all thank heaven i am going to-morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him stupid men are the only ones worth knowing after all take care lizzy that speech savours strongly of disappointment before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer we have not determined how far it shall carry us said mrs gardiner but perhaps to the lakes no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful oh my dear dear aunt she rapturously cried what delight what felicity you give me fresh life and vigour adieu to disappointment and spleen what are young men to rocks and mountains oh what hours of transport we shall spend and when we do return it shall not be like other travellers without being able to give one accurate idea of anything we will know where we have gone we will recollect what we have seen lakes mountains and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene will we begin quarreling about its relative situation let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers chapter every object in the next days journey was new and interesting to elizabeth and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford every eye was in search of the parsonage and every turning expected to bring it in view the palings of rosings park was their boundary on one side elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants at length the parsonage was discernible the garden sloping to the road the house standing in it the green pales and the laurel hedge everything declared they were arriving mr collins and charlotte appeared at the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party in a moment they were all out of the chaise rejoicing at the sight of each other mrs collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received she saw instantly that her cousins manners were not altered by his marriage his formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family they were then with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house and as soon as they were in the parlour he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his wifes offers of refreshment elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room its aspect and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him but though everything seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion when mr collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed which certainly was not unseldom she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte once or twice she could discern a faint blush but in general charlotte wisely did not hear after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room from the sideboard to the fender to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london mr collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden which was large and well laid out and to the cultivation of which he attended himself to work in this garden was one of his most respectable pleasures and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise and owned she encouraged it as much as possible here leading the way through every walk and cross walk and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for every view was
