not believe that the deposit supposing it had ever existed still existed and though he considered the treasure as by no means chimerical he yet believed it was no longer there however as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last chance and making them understand that they were condemned to perpetual imprisonment a new misfortune befell them the gallery on the sea side which had long been in ruins was rebuilt they had repaired it completely and stopped up with vast masses of stone the hole dants had partly filled in but for this precaution which it will be remembered the abb had made to edmond the misfortune would have been still greater for their attempt to escape would have been detected and they would undoubtedly have been separated thus a new a stronger and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the realization of their hopes you see said the young man with an air of sorrowful resignation to faria that god deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for what you call my devotion to you i have promised to remain forever with you and now i could not break my promise if i would the treasure will be no more mine than yours and neither of us will quit this prison but my real treasure is not that my dear friend which awaits me beneath the sombre rocks of monte cristo it is your presence our living together five or six hours a day in spite of our jailers it is the rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain the languages you have implanted in my memory and which have taken root there with all their philological ramifications these different sciences that you have made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of them and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced them this is my treasure my beloved friend and with this you have made me rich and happy believe me and take comfort this is better for me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds even were they not as problematical as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the sea which we take for terra firma and which evaporate and vanish as we draw near to them to have you as long as possible near me to hear your eloquent speech which embellishes my mind strengthens my soul and makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible things if i should ever be free so fills my whole existence that the despair to which i was just on the point of yielding when i knew you has no longer any hold over me and this this is my fortune not chimerical but actual i owe you my real good my present happiness and all the sovereigns of the earth even csar borgia himself could not deprive me of this thus if not actually happy yet the days these two unfortunates passed together went quickly faria who for so long a time had kept silence as to the treasure now perpetually talked of it as he had prophesied would be the case he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left leg and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself but he was continually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion and anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy for fear the letter might be some day lost or stolen he compelled dants to learn it by heart and dants knew it from the first to the last word then he destroyed the second portion assured that if the first were seized no one would be able to discover its real meaning whole hours sometimes passed while faria was giving instructions to dants instructions which were to serve him when he was at liberty then once free from the day and hour and moment when he was so he could have but one only thought which was to gain monte cristo by some means and remain there alone under some pretext which would arouse no suspicions and once there to endeavor to find the wonderful caverns and search in the appointed spot the appointed spot be it remembered being the farthest angle in the second opening in the meanwhile the hours passed if not rapidly at least tolerably faria as we have said without having recovered the use of his hand and foot had regained all the clearness of his understanding and had gradually besides the moral instructions we have detailed taught his youthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner who learns to make something from nothing they were thus perpetually employed faria that he might not see himself grow old dants for fear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his memory like a distant light wandering in the night so life went on for them as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose activities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of providence but beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young man and perhaps in that of the old man many repressed desires many stifled sighs which found vent when faria was left alone and when edmond returned to
