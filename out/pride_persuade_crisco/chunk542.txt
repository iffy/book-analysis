my hand relaxing its hold of the laburnum felt the coldness of the stone on my right i saw the tree behind me the rock i stood in the same attitude and threw myself down i rose and again began digging and enlarging the hole still i found nothing nothing the chest was no longer there m the chest no longer there murmured madame danglars choking with fear think not i contented myself with this one effort continued villefort no i searched the whole thicket i thought the assassin having discovered the chest and supposing it to be a treasure had intended carrying it off but perceiving his error had dug another hole and deposited it there but i could find nothing then the idea struck me that he had not taken these precautions and had simply thrown it in a corner in the last case i must wait for daylight to renew my search i remained in the room and waited oh heaven m when daylight dawned i went down again my first visit was to the thicket i hoped to find some traces which had escaped me in the darkness i had turned up the earth over a surface of more than twenty feet square and a depth of two feet a laborer would not have done in a day what occupied me an hour but i could find nothing absolutely nothing then i renewed the search supposing it had been thrown aside it would probably be on the path which led to the little gate but this examination was as useless as the first and with a bursting heart i returned to the thicket which now contained no hope for me oh cried madame danglars it was enough to drive you mad i hoped for a moment that it might said villefort but that happiness was denied me however recovering my strength and my ideas why said i should that man have carried away the corpse but you said replied madame danglars he would require it as a proof ah no madame that could not be dead bodies are not kept a year they are shown to a magistrate and the evidence is taken now nothing of the kind has happened what then asked hermine trembling violently something more terrible more fatal more alarming for us the child was perhaps alive and the assassin may have saved it madame danglars uttered a piercing cry and seizing villeforts hands exclaimed my child was alive said she you buried my child alive you were not certain my child was dead and you buried it ah madame danglars had risen and stood before the procureur whose hands she wrung in her feeble grasp i know not i merely suppose so as i might suppose anything else replied villefort with a look so fixed it indicated that his powerful mind was on the verge of despair and madness ah my child my poor child cried the baroness falling on her chair and stifling her sobs in her handkerchief villefort becoming somewhat reassured perceived that to avert the maternal storm gathering over his head he must inspire madame danglars with the terror he felt you understand then that if it were so said he rising in his turn and approaching the baroness to speak to her in a lower tone we are lost this child lives and someone knows it lives someone is in possession of our secret and since monte cristo speaks before us of a child disinterred when that child could not be found it is he who is in possession of our secret just god avenging god murmured madame danglars villeforts only answer was a stifled groan but the child the child sir repeated the agitated mother how i have searched for him replied villefort wringing his hands how i have called him in my long sleepless nights how i have longed for royal wealth to purchase a million of secrets from a million of men and to find mine among them at last one day when for the hundredth time i took up my spade i asked myself again and again what the corsican could have done with the child a child encumbers a fugitive perhaps on perceiving it was still alive he had thrown it into the river impossible cried madame danglars a man may murder another out of revenge but he would not deliberately drown a child perhaps continued villefort he had put it in the foundling hospital oh yes yes cried the baroness my child is there i ran to the hospital and learned that the same night the night of the th of september a child had been brought there wrapped in part of a fine linen napkin purposely torn in half this portion of the napkin was marked with half a barons crown and the letter h truly truly said madame danglars all my linen is marked thus monsieur de nargonne was a baron and my name is hermine thank god my child was not then dead no it was not dead and you can tell me so without fearing to make me die of joy where is the child villefort shrugged his shoulders do i know said he and do you believe that if i knew i would relate to you all its trials and all its adventures as would a dramatist or a
