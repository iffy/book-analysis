and her stockbroker she speculated and lost it is true she speculates with her own money not mine nevertheless you can understand that when francs leave the wifes pocket the husband always finds it out but do you mean to say you have not heard of this why the thing has made a tremendous noise yes i heard it spoken of but i did not know the details and then no one can be more ignorant than i am of the affairs in the bourse m then you do not speculate i how could i speculate when i already have so much trouble in regulating my income i should be obliged besides my steward to keep a clerk and a boy but touching these spanish affairs i think that the baroness did not dream the whole of the don carlos matter the papers said something about it did they not then you believe the papers i not the least in the world only i fancied that the honest messager was an exception to the rule and that it only announced telegraphic despatches well thats what puzzles me replied danglars the news of the return of don carlos was brought by telegraph so that said monte cristo you have lost nearly francs this month not nearly indeed that is exactly my loss diable said monte cristo compassionately it is a hard blow for a third-rate fortune third-rate said danglars rather humble what do you mean by that certainly continued monte cristo i make three assortments in fortune first-rate second-rate and third-rate fortunes i call those first-rate which are composed of treasures one possesses under ones hand such as mines lands and funded property in such states as france austria and england provided these treasures and property form a total of about a hundred millions i call those second-rate fortunes that are gained by manufacturing enterprises joint-stock companies viceroyalties and principalities not drawing more than francs the whole forming a capital of about fifty millions finally i call those third-rate fortunes which are composed of a fluctuating capital dependent upon the will of others or upon chances which a bankruptcy involves or a false telegram shakes such as banks speculations of the day in fact all operations under the influence of greater or less mischances the whole bringing in a real or fictitious capital of about fifteen millions i think this is about your position is it not confound it yes replied danglars the result then of six more such months as this would be to reduce the third-rate house to despair oh said danglars becoming very pale how you are running on let us imagine seven such months continued monte cristo in the same tone tell me have you ever thought that seven times francs make nearly twelve millions no you have not well you are right for if you indulged in such reflections you would never risk your principal which is to the speculator what the skin is to civilized man we have our clothes some more splendid than others this is our credit but when a man dies he has only his skin in the same way on retiring from business you have nothing but your real principal of about five or six millions at the most for third-rate fortunes are never more than a fourth of what they appear to be like the locomotive on a railway the size of which is magnified by the smoke and steam surrounding it well out of the five or six millions which form your real capital you have just lost nearly two millions which must of course in the same degree diminish your credit and fictitious fortune to follow out my simile your skin has been opened by bleeding and this if repeated three or four times will cause death so pay attention to it my dear monsieur danglars do you want money do you wish me to lend you some m what a bad calculator you are exclaimed danglars calling to his assistance all his philosophy and dissimulation i have made money at the same time by speculations which have succeeded i have made up the loss of blood by nutrition i lost a battle in spain i have been defeated in trieste but my naval army in india will have taken some galleons and my mexican pioneers will have discovered some mine very good very good but the wound remains and will reopen at the first loss no for i am only embarked in certainties replied danglars with the air of a mountebank sounding his own praises to involve me three governments must crumble to dust well such things have been that there should be a famine recollect the seven fat and the seven lean kine or that the sea should become dry as in the days of pharaoh and even then my vessels would become caravans so much the better i congratulate you my dear m danglars said monte cristo i see i was deceived and that you belong to the class of second-rate fortunes i think i may aspire to that honor said danglars with a smile which reminded monte cristo of the sickly moons which bad artists are so fond of daubing into their pictures of ruins but while we are speaking of business danglars added pleased to find an opportunity of changing the subject tell me what
