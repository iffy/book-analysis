false report as for myself i first heard you spoken of by my friend wilmore the philanthropist i believe he found you in some unpleasant position but do not know of what nature for i did not ask not being inquisitive your misfortunes engaged his sympathies so you see you must have been interesting he told me that he was anxious to restore you to the position which you had lost and that he would seek your father until he found him he did seek and has found him apparently since he is here now and finally my friend apprised me of your coming and gave me a few other instructions relative to your future fortune i am quite aware that my friend wilmore is peculiar but he is sincere and as rich as a gold mine consequently he may indulge his eccentricities without any fear of their ruining him and i have promised to adhere to his instructions now sir pray do not be offended at the question i am about to put to you as it comes in the way of my duty as your patron i would wish to know if the misfortunes which have happened to you misfortunes entirely beyond your control and which in no degree diminish my regard for you i would wish to know if they have not in some measure contributed to render you a stranger to the world in which your fortune and your name entitle you to make a conspicuous figure sir returned the young man with a reassurance of manner make your mind easy on this score those who took me from my father and who always intended sooner or later to sell me again to my original proprietor as they have now done calculated that in order to make the most of their bargain it would be politic to leave me in possession of all my personal and hereditary worth and even to increase the value if possible i have therefore received a very good education and have been treated by these kidnappers very much as the slaves were treated in asia minor whose masters made them grammarians doctors and philosophers in order that they might fetch a higher price in the roman market monte cristo smiled with satisfaction it appeared as if he had not expected so much from m andrea cavalcanti besides continued the young man if there did appear some defect in education or offence against the established forms of etiquette i suppose it would be excused in consideration of the misfortunes which accompanied my birth and followed me through my youth well said monte cristo in an indifferent tone you will do as you please count for you are the master of your own actions and are the person most concerned in the matter but if i were you i would not divulge a word of these adventures your history is quite a romance and the world which delights in romances in yellow covers strangely mistrusts those which are bound in living parchment even though they be gilded like yourself this is the kind of difficulty which i wished to represent to you my dear count you would hardly have recited your touching history before it would go forth to the world and be deemed unlikely and unnatural you would be no longer a lost child found but you would be looked upon as an upstart who had sprung up like a mushroom in the night you might excite a little curiosity but it is not everyone who likes to be made the centre of observation and the subject of unpleasant remark i agree with you monsieur said the young man turning pale and in spite of himself trembling beneath the scrutinizing look of his companion such consequences would be extremely unpleasant nevertheless you must not exaggerate the evil said monte cristo for by endeavoring to avoid one fault you will fall into another you must resolve upon one simple and single line of conduct and for a man of your intelligence this plan is as easy as it is necessary you must form honorable friendships and by that means counteract the prejudice which may attach to the obscurity of your former life andrea visibly changed countenance i would offer myself as your surety and friendly adviser said monte cristo did i not possess a moral distrust of my best friends and a sort of inclination to lead others to doubt them too therefore in departing from this rule i should as the actors say be playing a part quite out of my line and should therefore run the risk of being hissed which would be an act of folly however your excellency said andrea in consideration of lord wilmore by whom i was recommended to you yes certainly interrupted monte cristo but lord wilmore did not omit to inform me my dear m andrea that the season of your youth was rather a stormy one ah said the count watching andreas countenance i do not demand any confession from you it is precisely to avoid that necessity that your father was sent for from lucca you shall soon see him he is a little stiff and pompous in his manner and he is disfigured by his uniform but when it becomes known that he has been for eighteen years in the austrian service all that
