had that letter fallen into the hands of another you my dear father would probably ere this have been shot villeforts father laughed come come said he will the restoration adopt imperial methods so promptly shot my dear boy what an idea where is the letter you speak of i know you too well to suppose you would allow such a thing to pass you i burnt it for fear that even a fragment should remain for that letter must have led to your condemnation and the destruction of your future prospects replied noirtier yes i can easily comprehend that but i have nothing to fear while i have you to protect me i do better than that sir i save you you do why really the thing becomes more and more dramatic explain yourself i must refer again to the club in the rue saint-jacques it appears that this club is rather a bore to the police why didnt they search more vigilantly they would have found they have not found but they are on the track yes that the usual phrase i am quite familiar with it when the police is at fault it declares that it is on the track and the government patiently awaits the day when it comes to say with a sneaking air that the track is lost yes but they have found a corpse the general has been killed and in all countries they call that a murder a murder do you call it why there is nothing to prove that the general was murdered people are found every day in the seine having thrown themselves in or having been drowned from not knowing how to swim father you know very well that the general was not a man to drown himself in despair and people do not bathe in the seine in the month of january no no do not be deceived this was murder in every sense of the word and who thus designated it the king himself the king i thought he was philosopher enough to allow that there was no murder in politics in politics my dear fellow you know as well as i do there are no men but ideas no feelings but interests in politics we do not kill a man we only remove an obstacle that is all would you like to know how matters have progressed well i will tell you it was thought reliance might be placed in general quesnel he was recommended to us from the island of elba one of us went to him and invited him to the rue saint-jacques where he would find some friends he came there and the plan was unfolded to him for leaving elba the projected landing etc when he had heard and comprehended all to the fullest extent he replied that he was a royalist then all looked at each other he was made to take an oath and did so but with such an ill grace that it was really tempting providence to swear thus and yet in spite of that the general was allowed to depart free perfectly free yet he did not return home what could that mean why my dear fellow that on leaving us he lost his way thats all a murder really villefort you surprise me you a deputy procureur to found an accusation on such bad premises did i ever say to you when you were fulfilling your character as a royalist and cut off the head of one of my party my son you have committed a murder no i said very well sir you have gained the victory tomorrow perchance it will be our turn but father take care when our turn comes our revenge will be sweeping i do not understand you you rely on the usurpers return we do you are mistaken he will not advance two leagues into the interior of france without being followed tracked and caught like a wild beast my dear fellow the emperor is at this moment on the way to grenoble on the th or th he will be at lyons and on the th or th at paris the people will rise yes to go and meet him he has but a handful of men with him and armies will be despatched against him yes to escort him into the capital really my dear grard you are but a child you think yourself well informed because the telegraph has told you three days after the landing the usurper has landed at cannes with several men he is pursued but where is he what is he doing you do not know at all and in this way they will chase him to paris without drawing a trigger grenoble and lyons are faithful cities and will oppose to him an impassable barrier grenoble will open her gates to him with enthusiasm all lyons will hasten to welcome him believe me we are as well informed as you and our police are as good as your own would you like a proof of it well you wished to conceal your journey from me and yet i knew of your arrival half an hour after you had passed the barrier you gave your direction to no one but your postilion yet i have your address and in proof i am here the very
