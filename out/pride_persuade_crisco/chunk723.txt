thus the poor sailor lives in the recollection of those who narrate his history his terrible story is recited in the chimney-corner and a shudder is felt at the description of his transit through the air to be swallowed by the deep then the count added aloud was his name ever known oh yes but only as no oh villefort villefort murmured the count this scene must often have haunted thy sleepless hours do you wish to see anything more sir said the concierge yes especially if you will show me the poor abbs room ah no yes no repeated the count who seemed to hear the voice of the abb answering him in those very words through the wall when asked his name come sir wait said monte cristo i wish to take one final glance around this room this is fortunate said the guide i have forgotten the other key go and fetch it i will leave you the torch sir no take it away i can see in the dark why you are like no they said he was so accustomed to darkness that he could see a pin in the darkest corner of his dungeon he spent fourteen years to arrive at that muttered the count the guide carried away the torch the count had spoken correctly scarcely had a few seconds elapsed ere he saw everything as distinctly as by daylight then he looked around him and really recognized his dungeon yes he said there is the stone upon which i used to sit there is the impression made by my shoulders on the wall there is the mark of my blood made when one day i dashed my head against the wall oh those figures how well i remember them i made them one day to calculate the age of my father that i might know whether i should find him still living and that of mercds to know if i should find her still free after finishing that calculation i had a minutes hope i did not reckon upon hunger and infidelity and a bitter laugh escaped the count he saw in fancy the burial of his father and the marriage of mercds on the other side of the dungeon he perceived an inscription the white letters of which were still visible on the green wall oh god he read preserve my memory oh yes he cried that was my only prayer at last i no longer begged for liberty but memory i dreaded to become mad and forgetful oh god thou hast preserved my memory i thank thee i thank thee at this moment the light of the torch was reflected on the wall the guide was coming monte cristo went to meet him follow me sir and without ascending the stairs the guide conducted him by a subterraneous passage to another entrance there again monte cristo was assailed by a multitude of thoughts the first thing that met his eye was the meridian drawn by the abb on the wall by which he calculated the time then he saw the remains of the bed on which the poor prisoner had died the sight of this instead of exciting the anguish experienced by the count in the dungeon filled his heart with a soft and grateful sentiment and tears fell from his eyes this is where the mad abb was kept sir and that is where the young man entered and the guide pointed to the opening which had remained unclosed from the appearance of the stone he continued a learned gentleman discovered that the prisoners might have communicated together for ten years poor things those must have been ten weary years dants took some louis from his pocket and gave them to the man who had twice unconsciously pitied him the guide took them thinking them merely a few pieces of little value but the light of the torch revealed their true worth sir he said you have made a mistake you have given me gold i know it the concierge looked upon the count with surprise sir he cried scarcely able to believe his good fortune sir i cannot understand your generosity oh it is very simple my good fellow i have been a sailor and your story touched me more than it would others then sir since you are so liberal i ought to offer you something m what have you to offer to me my friend shells straw-work thank you no sir neither of those something connected with this story really what is it listen said the guide i said to myself something is always left in a cell inhabited by one prisoner for fifteen years so i began to sound the wall ah cried monte cristo remembering the abbs two hiding-places after some search i found that the floor gave a hollow sound near the head of the bed and at the hearth yes said the count yes i raised the stones and found a rope-ladder and some tools how do you know that asked the guide in astonishment i do not know i only guess it because that sort of thing is generally found in prisoners cells yes sir a rope-ladder and tools and have you them yet no sir i sold them to visitors who considered them great curiosities but i have still something left what is
