austerlitz ideas do not become extinct sire they slumber sometimes but only revive the stronger before they sleep entirely ideas and men appeared the same to him said albert one thing only puzzles me namely how franz dpinay will like a grandfather who cannot be separated from his wife but where is franz in the first carriage with m de villefort who considers him already as one of the family m such was the conversation in almost all the carriages these two sudden deaths so quickly following each other astonished everyone but no one suspected the terrible secret which m davrigny had communicated in his nocturnal walk to m de villefort they arrived in about an hour at the cemetery the weather was mild but dull and in harmony with the funeral ceremony among the groups which flocked towards the family vault chteau-renaud recognized morrel who had come alone in a cabriolet and walked silently along the path bordered with yew-trees you here said chteau-renaud passing his arms through the young captains are you a friend of villeforts how is it that i have never met you at his house i am no acquaintance of m de villeforts answered morrel but i was of madame de saint-mran albert came up to them at this moment with franz the time and place are but ill-suited for an introduction said albert but we are not superstitious m morrel allow me to present to you m franz dpinay a delightful travelling companion with whom i made the tour of italy my dear franz m maximilian morrel an excellent friend i have acquired in your absence and whose name you will hear me mention every time i make any allusion to affection wit or amiability morrel hesitated for a moment he feared it would be hypocritical to accost in a friendly manner the man whom he was tacitly opposing but his oath and the gravity of the circumstances recurred to his memory he struggled to conceal his emotion and bowed to franz mademoiselle de villefort is in deep sorrow is she not said debray to franz extremely replied he she looked so pale this morning i scarcely knew her these apparently simple words pierced morrel to the heart this man had seen valentine and spoken to her the young and high-spirited officer required all his strength of mind to resist breaking his oath he took the arm of chteau-renaud and turned towards the vault where the attendants had already placed the two coffins this is a magnificent habitation said beauchamp looking towards the mausoleum a summer and winter palace you will in turn enter it my dear dpinay for you will soon be numbered as one of the family i as a philosopher should like a little country-house a cottage down there under the trees without so many free-stones over my poor body in dying i will say to those around me what voltaire wrote to piron eo rus and all will be over but come franz take courage your wife is an heiress indeed beauchamp you are unbearable politics has made you laugh at everything and political men have made you disbelieve everything but when you have the honor of associating with ordinary men and the pleasure of leaving politics for a moment try to find your affectionate heart which you leave with your stick when you go to the chamber but tell me said beauchamp what is life is it not a halt in deaths anteroom m i am prejudiced against beauchamp said albert drawing franz away and leaving the former to finish his philosophical dissertation with debray the villefort vault formed a square of white stones about twenty feet high an interior partition separated the two families and each apartment had its entrance door here were not as in other tombs ignoble drawers one above another where thrift bestows its dead and labels them like specimens in a museum all that was visible within the bronze gates was a gloomy-looking room separated by a wall from the vault itself the two doors before mentioned were in the middle of this wall and enclosed the villefort and saint-mran coffins there grief might freely expend itself without being disturbed by the trifling loungers who came from a picnic party to visit pre-lachaise or by lovers who make it their rendezvous the two coffins were placed on trestles previously prepared for their reception in the right-hand crypt belonging to the saint-mran family villefort franz and a few near relatives alone entered the sanctuary as the religious ceremonies had all been performed at the door and there was no address given the party all separated chteau-renaud albert and morrel went one way and debray and beauchamp the other franz remained with m de villefort at the gate of the cemetery morrel made an excuse to wait he saw franz and m de villefort get into the same mourning-coach and thought this meeting forboded evil he then returned to paris and although in the same carriage with chteau-renaud and albert he did not hear one word of their conversation as franz was about to take leave of m de villefort when shall i see you again said the latter at what time you please sir replied franz as soon as possible i am at your command sir shall we return together if not unpleasant to you on the
