as a excuse but they seemed almost hurt that captain wentworth should have brought any such party to lyme without considering it as a thing of course that they should dine with them there was so much attachment to captain wentworth in all this and such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon so unlike the usual style of give-and-take invitations and dinners of formality and display that anne felt her spirits not likely to be benefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother-officers these would have been all my friends was her thought and she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness on quitting the cobb they all went in-doors with their new friends and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart could think capable of accommodating so many anne had a moments astonishment on the subject herself but it was soon lost in the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all the ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of captain harville to turn the actual space to the best account to supply the deficiencies of lodging-house furniture and defend the windows and doors against the winter storms to be expected the varieties in the fitting-up of the rooms where the common necessaries provided by the owner in the common indifferent plight were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood excellently worked up and with something curious and valuable from all the distant countries captain harville had visited were more than amusing to anne connected as it all was with his profession the fruit of its labours the effect of its influence on his habits the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented made it to her a something more or less than gratification captain harville was no reader but he had contrived excellent accommodations and fashioned very pretty shelves for a tolerable collection of well-bound volumes the property of captain benwick his lameness prevented him from taking much exercise but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with constant employment within he drew he varnished he carpentered he glued he made toys for the children he fashioned new netting-needles and pins with improvements and if everything else was done sat down to his large fishing-net at one corner of the room anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they quitted the house and louisa by whom she found herself walking burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character of the navy their friendliness their brotherliness their openness their uprightness protesting that she was convinced of sailors having more worth and warmth than any other set of men in england that they only knew how to live and they only deserved to be respected and loved they went back to dress and dine and so well had the scheme answered already that nothing was found amiss though its being so entirely out of season and the no thoroughfare of lyme and the no expectation of company had brought many apologies from the heads of the inn anne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened to being in captain wentworths company than she had at first imagined could ever be that the sitting down to the same table with him now and the interchange of the common civilities attending on it they never got beyond was become a mere nothing the nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow but captain harville had promised them a visit in the evening and he came bringing his friend also which was more than had been expected it having been agreed that captain benwick had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of so many strangers he ventured among them again however though his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth of the party in general while captains wentworth and harville led the talk on one side of the room and by recurring to former days supplied anecdotes in abundance to occupy and entertain the others it fell to annes lot to be placed rather apart with captain benwick and a very good impulse of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him he was shy and disposed to abstraction but the engaging mildness of her countenance and gentleness of her manners soon had their effect and anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion he was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading though principally in poetry and besides the persuasion of having given him at least an evenings indulgence in the discussion of subjects which his usual companions had probably no concern in she had the hope of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of struggling against affliction which had naturally grown out of their conversation for though shy he did not seem reserved it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints and having talked of poetry the richness of the present age and gone through a brief comparison of opinion as to the first-rate poets trying to ascertain whether marmion or the lady of the lake were to be preferred and how ranked the giaour and the bride
