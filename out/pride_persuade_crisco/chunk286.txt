from the bastille then there are those for which chance sometimes affords opportunity and those are the best of all let us therefore wait patiently for some favorable moment and when it presents itself profit by it ah said dants you might well endure the tedious delay you were constantly employed in the task you set yourself and when weary with toil you had your hopes to refresh and encourage you i assure you replied the old man i did not turn to that source for recreation or support what did you do then i wrote or studied were you then permitted the use of pens ink and paper oh no answered the abb i had none but what i made for myself you made paper pens and ink yes dants gazed with admiration but he had some difficulty in believing faria saw this when you pay me a visit in my cell my young friend said he i will show you an entire work the fruits of the thoughts and reflections of my whole life many of them meditated over in the shades of the colosseum at rome at the foot of st marks column at venice and on the borders of the arno at florence little imagining at the time that they would be arranged in order within the walls of the chteau dif the work i speak of is called a treatise on the possibility of a general monarchy in italy and will make one large quarto volume and on what have you written all this on two of my shirts i invented a preparation that makes linen as smooth and as easy to write on as parchment you are then a chemist somewhat i know lavoisier and was the intimate friend of cabanis but for such a work you must have needed books had you any i had nearly five thousand volumes in my library at rome but after reading them over many times i found out that with one hundred and fifty well-chosen books a man possesses if not a complete summary of all human knowledge at least all that a man need really know i devoted three years of my life to reading and studying these one hundred and fifty volumes till i knew them nearly by heart so that since i have been in prison a very slight effort of memory has enabled me to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open before me i could recite you the whole of thucydides xenophon plutarch titus livius tacitus strada jornandes dante montaigne shakespeare spinoza machiavelli and bossuet i name only the most important you are doubtless acquainted with a variety of languages so as to have been able to read all these yes i speak five of the modern tongues that is to say german french italian english and spanish by the aid of ancient greek i learned modern greek i dont speak it so well as i could wish but i am still trying to improve myself improve yourself repeated dants why how can you manage to do so why i made a vocabulary of the words i knew turned returned and arranged them so as to enable me to express my thoughts through their medium i know nearly one thousand words which is all that is absolutely necessary although i believe there are nearly one hundred thousand in the dictionaries i cannot hope to be very fluent but i certainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes and that would be quite as much as i should ever require stronger grew the wonder of dants who almost fancied he had to do with one gifted with supernatural powers still hoping to find some imperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings he added then if you were not furnished with pens how did you manage to write the work you speak of i made myself some excellent ones which would be universally preferred to all others if once known you are aware what huge whitings are served to us on maigre days well i selected the cartilages of the heads of these fishes and you can scarcely imagine the delight with which i welcomed the arrival of each wednesday friday and saturday as affording me the means of increasing my stock of pens for i will freely confess that my historical labors have been my greatest solace and relief while retracing the past i forget the present and traversing at will the path of history i cease to remember that i am myself a prisoner but the ink said dants of what did you make your ink there was formerly a fireplace in my dungeon replied faria but it was closed up long ere i became an occupant of this prison still it must have been many years in use for it was thickly covered with a coating of soot this soot i dissolved in a portion of the wine brought to me every sunday and i assure you a better ink cannot be desired for very important notes for which closer attention is required i pricked one of my fingers and wrote with my own blood and when asked dants may i see all this whenever you please replied the abb oh then let it be directly exclaimed the young man follow
