the large beads of perspiration that gathered on his brow m but the strangest part of the story is resumed the abb that dants even in his dying moments swore by his crucified redeemer that he was utterly ignorant of the cause of his detention and so he was murmured caderousse how should he have been otherwise ah sir the poor fellow told you the truth and for that reason he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he had never been able to penetrate and to clear his memory should any foul spot or stain have fallen on it and here the look of the abb becoming more and more fixed seemed to rest with ill-concealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was rapidly spreading over the countenance of caderousse a rich englishman continued the abb who had been his companion in misfortune but had been released from prison during the second restoration was possessed of a diamond of immense value this jewel he bestowed on dants upon himself quitting the prison as a mark of his gratitude for the kindness and brotherly care with which dants had nursed him in a severe illness he underwent during his confinement instead of employing this diamond in attempting to bribe his jailers who might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor dants carefully preserved it that in the event of his getting out of prison he might have wherewithal to live for the sale of such a diamond would have quite sufficed to make his fortune then i suppose asked caderousse with eager glowing looks that it was a stone of immense value why everything is relative answered the abb to one in edmonds position the diamond certainly was of great value it was estimated at fifty thousand francs bless me exclaimed caderousse fifty thousand francs surely the diamond was as large as a nut to be worth all that no replied the abb it was not of such a size as that but you shall judge for yourself i have it with me the sharp gaze of caderousse was instantly directed towards the priests garments as though hoping to discover the location of the treasure calmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with black shagreen the abb opened it and displayed to the dazzled eyes of caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained set in a ring of admirable workmanship and that diamond cried caderousse almost breathless with eager admiration you say is worth fifty thousand francs it is without the setting which is also valuable replied the abb as he closed the box and returned it to his pocket while its brilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated innkeeper but how comes the diamond in your possession sir did edmond make you his heir no merely his testamentary executor i once possessed four dear and faithful friends besides the maiden to whom i was betrothed he said and i feel convinced they have all unfeignedly grieved over my loss the name of one of the four friends is caderousse the innkeeper shivered another of the number continued the abb without seeming to notice the emotion of caderousse is called danglars and the third in spite of being my rival entertained a very sincere affection for me a fiendish smile played over the features of caderousse who was about to break in upon the abbs speech when the latter waving his hand said allow me to finish first and then if you have any observations to make you can do so afterwards the third of my friends although my rival was much attached to me his name was fernand that of my betrothed was stay stay continued the abb i have forgotten what he called her mercds said caderousse eagerly true said the abb with a stifled sigh mercds it was go on urged caderousse bring me a carafe of water said the abb caderousse quickly performed the strangers bidding and after pouring some into a glass and slowly swallowing its contents the abb resuming his usual placidity of manner said as he placed his empty glass on the table where did we leave off the name of edmonds betrothed was mercds to be sure you will go to marseilles said dants for you understand i repeat his words just as he uttered them do you understand perfectly you will sell this diamond you will divide the money into five equal parts and give an equal portion to these good friends the only persons who have loved me upon earth but why into five parts asked caderousse you only mentioned four persons because the fifth is dead as i hear the fifth sharer in edmonds bequest was his own father too true too true ejaculated caderousse almost suffocated by the contending passions which assailed him the poor old man did die i learned so much at marseilles replied the abb making a strong effort to appear indifferent but from the length of time that has elapsed since the death of the elder dants i was unable to obtain any particulars of his end can you enlighten me on that point i do not know who could if i could not said caderousse why i lived almost on the same floor with the poor old man ah yes about a
