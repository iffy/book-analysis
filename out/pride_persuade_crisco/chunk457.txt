but the boy refuses saying you are too ugly ali turned his intelligent countenance towards the boy on whom he gazed without any apparent emotion but the spasmodic working of the nostrils showed to the practiced eye of monte cristo that the arab had been wounded to the heart will you permit me to inquire said madame de villefort as she arose to take her leave whether you usually reside here no i do not replied monte cristo it is a small place i have purchased quite lately my place of abode is no avenue des champs-lyses but i see you have quite recovered from your fright and are no doubt desirous of returning home anticipating your wishes i have desired the same horses you came with to be put to one of my carriages and ali he whom you think so very ugly continued he addressing the boy with a smiling air will have the honor of driving you home while your coachman remains here to attend to the necessary repairs of your calash as soon as that important business is concluded i will have a pair of my own horses harnessed to convey it direct to madame danglars i dare not return with those dreadful horses said madame de villefort you will see replied monte cristo that they will be as different as possible in the hands of ali with him they will be gentle and docile as lambs ali had indeed given proof of this for approaching the animals who had been got upon their legs with considerable difficulty he rubbed their foreheads and nostrils with a sponge soaked in aromatic vinegar and wiped off the sweat and foam that covered their mouths then commencing a loud whistling noise he rubbed them well all over their bodies for several minutes then undisturbed by the noisy crowd collected round the broken carriage ali quietly harnessed the pacified animals to the counts chariot took the reins in his hands and mounted the box when to the utter astonishment of those who had witnessed the ungovernable spirit and maddened speed of the same horses he was actually compelled to apply his whip in no very gentle manner before he could induce them to start and even then all that could be obtained from the celebrated dappled grays now changed into a couple of dull sluggish stupid brutes was a slow pottering pace kept up with so much difficulty that madame de villefort was more than two hours returning to her residence in the faubourg saint-honor m scarcely had the first congratulations upon her marvellous escape been gone through when she wrote the following letter to madame danglars dear hermine i have just had a wonderful escape from the most imminent danger and i owe my safety to the very count of monte cristo we were talking about yesterday but whom i little expected to see today i remember how unmercifully i laughed at what i considered your eulogistic and exaggerated praises of him but i have now ample cause to admit that your enthusiastic description of this wonderful man fell far short of his merits your horses got as far as ranelagh when they darted forward like mad things and galloped away at so fearful a rate that there seemed no other prospect for myself and my poor edward but that of being dashed to pieces against the first object that impeded their progress when a strange-looking man an arab a negro or a nubian at least a black of some nation or other at a signal from the count whose domestic he is suddenly seized and stopped the infuriated animals even at the risk of being trampled to death himself and certainly he must have had a most wonderful escape the count then hastened to us and took us into his house where he speedily recalled my poor edward to life he sent us home in his own carriage yours will be returned to you tomorrow you will find your horses in bad condition from the results of this accident they seem thoroughly stupefied as if sulky and vexed at having been conquered by man the count however has commissioned me to assure you that two or three days rest with plenty of barley for their sole food during that time will bring them back to as fine that is as terrifying a condition as they were in yesterday m adieu i cannot return you many thanks for the drive of yesterday but after all i ought not to blame you for the misconduct of your horses more especially as it procured me the pleasure of an introduction to the count of monte cristo and certainly that illustrious personage apart from the millions he is said to be so very anxious to dispose of seemed to me one of those curiously interesting problems i for one delight in solving at any risk even if it were to necessitate another drive to the bois behind your horses edward endured the accident with miraculous courage he did not utter a single cry but fell lifeless into my arms nor did a tear fall from his eyes after it was over i doubt not you will consider these praises the result of blind maternal affection but there is a soul of iron in that delicate fragile body valentine sends many affectionate remembrances to your
