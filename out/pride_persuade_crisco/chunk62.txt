have the best informed mind but why mr darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand it could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself he seldom appeared really animated mrs collins knew not what to make of him colonel fitzwilliams occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told her and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect of love and the object of that love her friend eliza she set herself seriously to work to find it out she watched him whenever they were at rosings and whenever he came to hunsford but without much success he certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was disputable it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and mrs collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friends dislike would vanish if she could suppose him to be in her power in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam he was beyond comparison the most pleasant man he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but to counterbalance these advantages mr darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all chapter more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park unexpectedly meet mr darcy she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd yet it did and even a third it seemed like wilful ill-nature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of mr and mrs collinss happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too his words seemed to imply it could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts she supposed if he meant anything he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter it distressed her a little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage she was engaged one day as she walked in perusing janes last letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by mr darcy she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile she said i did not know before that you ever walked this way i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage are you going much farther no i should have turned in a moment and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage together do you certainly leave kent on saturday said she yes if darcy does not put it off again but i am at his disposal he arranges the business just as he pleases and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least pleasure in the great power of choice i do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr darcy he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam but so we all do it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor i speak feelingly a younger son you know must be inured to self-denial and dependence in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of either now seriously what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature but in matters of greater weight
