miss lucas she added in a melancholy tone for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am cruelly used nobody feels for my poor nerves charlottes reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth aye there she comes continued mrs bennet looking as unconcerned as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided she can have her own way but i tell you miss lizzy if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead i shall not be able to keep you and so i warn you i have done with you from this very day i told you in the library you know that i should never speak to you again and you will find me as good as my word i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to anybody people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking nobody can tell what i suffer but it is always so those who do not complain are never pitied her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the irritation she talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr collins who entered the room with an air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said to the girls now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and let me and mr collins have a little conversation together elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlotte detained first by the civility of mr collins whose enquiries after herself and all her family were very minute and then by a little curiosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear in a doleful voice mrs bennet began the projected conversation oh mr collins my dear madam replied he let us be for ever silent on this point far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure to resent the behaviour of your daughter resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment and i trust i am resigned perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation you will not i hope consider me as showing any disrespect to your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughters favour without having paid yourself and mr bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughters lips instead of your own but we are all liable to error i have certainly meant well through the whole affair my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise chapter the discussion of mr collinss offer was now nearly at an end and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her mother as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence he scarcely ever spoke to her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all and especially to her friend the morrow produced no abatement of mrs bennets ill-humour or ill health mr collins was also in the same state of angry pride elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it he was always to have gone on saturday and to saturday he meant to stay after breakfast the girls walked to meryton to enquire if mr wickham were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunts where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody was well talked over to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self-imposed i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meet mr darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes
