eagerly opposed by his wife with oh no indeed charles i cannot bear to have you go away only think if anything should happen the child had a good night and was going on well the next day it must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been done to the spine but mr robinson found nothing to increase alarm and charles musgrove began consequently to feel no necessity for longer confinement the child was to be kept in bed and amused as quietly as possible but what was there for a father to do this was quite a female case and it would be highly absurd in him who could be of no use at home to shut himself up his father very much wished him to meet captain wentworth and there being no sufficient reason against it he ought to go and it ended in his making a bold public declaration when he came in from shooting of his meaning to dress directly and dine at the other house nothing can be going on better than the child said he so i told my father just now that i would come and he thought me quite right your sister being with you my love i have no scruple at all you would not like to leave him yourself but you see i can be of no use anne will send for me if anything is the matter husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain mary knew from charless manner of speaking that he was quite determined on going and that it would be of no use to teaze him she said nothing therefore till he was out of the room but as soon as there was only anne to hear so you and i are to be left to shift by ourselves with this poor sick child and not a creature coming near us all the evening i knew how it would be this is always my luck if there is anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it and charles is as bad as any of them very unfeeling i must say it is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy talks of his being going on so well how does he know that he is going on well or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence i did not think charles would have been so unfeeling so here he is to go away and enjoy himself and because i am the poor mother i am not to be allowed to stir and yet i am sure i am more unfit than anybody else to be about the child my being the mother is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried i am not at all equal to it you saw how hysterical i was yesterday but that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm--of the shock you will not be hysterical again i dare say we shall have nothing to distress us i perfectly understand mr robinsons directions and have no fears and indeed mary i cannot wonder at your husband nursing does not belong to a man it is not his province a sick child is always the mothers property her own feelings generally make it so i hope i am as fond of my child as any mother but i do not know that i am of any more use in the sick-room than charles for i cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill and you saw this morning that if i told him to keep quiet he was sure to begin kicking about i have not nerves for the sort of thing but could you be comfortable yourself to be spending the whole evening away from the poor boy yes you see his papa can and why should not i jemima is so careful and she could send us word every hour how he was i really think charles might as well have told his father we would all come i am not more alarmed about little charles now than he is i was dreadfully alarmed yesterday but the case is very different to-day well if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself suppose you were to go as well as your husband leave little charles to my care mr and mrs musgrove cannot think it wrong while i remain with him are you serious cried mary her eyes brightening dear me thats a very good thought very good indeed to be sure i may just as well go as not for i am of no use at home--am i and it only harasses me you who have not a mothers feelings are a great deal the properest person you can make little charles do anything he always minds you at a word it will be a great deal better than leaving him only with jemima oh i shall certainly go i am sure i ought if i can quite as much as charles for they want me excessively to be acquainted with captain wentworth and i know you do not mind being left alone an excellent thought of yours indeed anne i will go
