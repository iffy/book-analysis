of painting you are perfectly right in objecting to them for this one great fault that they have not yet had time to become old or will you allow me to show you several fine statues by thorwaldsen bartoloni and canova all foreign artists for as you may perceive i think but very indifferently of our french sculptors you have a right to be unjust to them monsieur they are your compatriots but all this may come later when we shall be better known to each other for the present i will confine myself if perfectly agreeable to you to introducing you to the baroness danglars excuse my impatience my dear count but a client like you is almost like a member of the family monte cristo bowed in sign that he accepted the proffered honor danglars rang and was answered by a servant in a showy livery is the baroness at home inquired danglars yes my lord answered the man and alone no my lord madame has visitors have you any objection to meet any persons who may be with madame or do you desire to preserve a strict incognito no indeed replied monte cristo with a smile i do not arrogate to myself the right of so doing and who is with madame m debray inquired danglars with an air of indulgence and good-nature that made monte cristo smile acquainted as he was with the secrets of the bankers domestic life yes my lord replied the servant m debray is with madame danglars nodded his head then turning to monte cristo said m lucien debray is an old friend of ours and private secretary to the minister of the interior as for my wife i must tell you she lowered herself by marrying me for she belongs to one of the most ancient families in france her maiden name was de servires and her first husband was colonel the marquis of nargonne i have not the honor of knowing madame danglars but i have already met m lucien debray ah indeed said danglars and where was that at the house of m de morcerf ah you are acquainted with the young viscount are you we were together a good deal during the carnival at rome true true cried danglars let me see have i not heard talk of some strange adventure with bandits or thieves hid in ruins and of his having had a miraculous escape i forget how but i know he used to amuse my wife and daughter by telling them about it after his return from italy her ladyship is waiting to receive you gentlemen said the servant who had gone to inquire the pleasure of his mistress with your permission said danglars bowing i will precede you to show you the way by all means replied monte cristo i follow you chapter the dappled grays the baron followed by the count traversed a long series of apartments in which the prevailing characteristics were heavy magnificence and the gaudiness of ostentatious wealth until he reached the boudoir of madame danglars a small octagonal-shaped room hung with pink satin covered with white indian muslin the chairs were of ancient workmanship and materials over the doors were painted sketches of shepherds and shepherdesses after the style and manner of boucher and at each side pretty medallions in crayons harmonizing well with the furnishings of this charming apartment the only one throughout the great mansion in which any distinctive taste prevailed the truth was it had been entirely overlooked in the plan arranged and followed out by m danglars and his architect who had been selected to aid the baron in the great work of improvement solely because he was the most fashionable and celebrated decorator of the day the decorations of the boudoir had then been left entirely to madame danglars and lucien debray m danglars however while possessing a great admiration for the antique as it was understood during the time of the directory entertained the most sovereign contempt for the simple elegance of his wifes favorite sitting-room where by the way he was never permitted to intrude unless indeed he excused his own appearance by ushering in some more agreeable visitor than himself and even then he had rather the air and manner of a person who was himself introduced than that of being the presenter of another his reception being cordial or frigid in proportion as the person who accompanied him chanced to please or displease the baroness madame danglars who although past the first bloom of youth was still strikingly handsome was now seated at the piano a most elaborate piece of cabinet and inlaid work while lucien debray standing before a small work-table was turning over the pages of an album lucien had found time preparatory to the counts arrival to relate many particulars respecting him to madame danglars it will be remembered that monte cristo had made a lively impression on the minds of all the party assembled at the breakfast given by albert de morcerf and although debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings he had never been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the impressive look and manner of the count consequently the description given by lucien to the baroness bore the highly-colored tinge of his own heated imagination already excited
