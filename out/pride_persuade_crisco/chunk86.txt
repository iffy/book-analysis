when he put his letter into her hand she knew not what to think or how to account for it they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where mr darcy then was she longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of everything she was still dear to him perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with composure at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind aroused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds when in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the stream mr gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round it settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water and one of its narrowest parts they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house mrs gardiner who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but their progress was slow for mr gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeths astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr darcy approaching them and at no great distance the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them for a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path the idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the turning past he was immediately before them with a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed her colour changed and she said no more mrs gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself what will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are he takes them now for people of fashion the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions that he was surprised by the connection was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with mr gardiner elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph it was consoling that he should
