to tell me sir yes i have presently but here comes a friend captain brigden i shall only say how d'ye do as we pass however i shall not stop how d'ye do brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife she poor soul is tied by the leg she has a blister on one of her heels as large as a three-shilling piece if you look across the street you will see admiral brand coming down and his brother shabby fellows both of them i am glad they are not on this side of the way sophy cannot bear them they played me a pitiful trick once got away with some of my best men i will tell you the whole story another time there comes old sir archibald drew and his grandson look he sees us he kisses his hand to you he takes you for my wife ah the peace has come too soon for that younker poor old sir archibald how do you like bath miss elliot it suits us very well we are always meeting with some old friend or other the streets full of them every morning sure to have plenty of chat and then we get away from them all and shut ourselves in our lodgings and draw in our chairs and are as snug as if we were at kellynch ay or as we used to be even at north yarmouth and deal we do not like our lodgings here the worse i can tell you for putting us in mind of those we first had at north yarmouth the wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way when they were got a little farther anne ventured to press again for what he had to communicate she hoped when clear of milsom street to have her curiosity gratified but she was still obliged to wait for the admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had gained the greater space and quiet of belmont and as she was not really mrs croft she must let him have his own way as soon as they were fairly ascending belmont he began well now you shall hear something that will surprise you but first of all you must tell me the name of the young lady i am going to talk about that young lady you know that we have all been so concerned for the miss musgrove that all this has been happening to her christian name i always forget her christian name anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really did but now she could safely suggest the name of louisa ay ay miss louisa musgrove that is the name i wish young ladies had not such a number of fine christian names i should never be out if they were all sophys or something of that sort well this miss louisa we all thought you know was to marry frederick he was courting her week after week the only wonder was what they could be waiting for till the business at lyme came then indeed it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain was set to right but even then there was something odd in their way of going on instead of staying at lyme he went off to plymouth and then he went off to see edward when we came back from minehead he was gone down to edward's and there he has been ever since we have seen nothing of him since november even sophy could not understand it but now the matter has taken the strangest turn of all for this young lady the same miss musgrove instead of being to marry frederick is to marry james benwick you know james benwick a little i am a little acquainted with captain benwick well she is to marry him nay most likely they are married already for i do not know what they should wait for i thought captain benwick a very pleasing young man said anne and i understand that he bears an excellent character oh yes yes there is not a word to be said against james benwick he is only a commander it is true made last summer and these are bad times for getting on but he has not another fault that i know of an excellent good-hearted fellow i assure you a very active zealous officer too which is more than you would think for perhaps for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice indeed you are mistaken there sir i should never augur want of spirit from captain benwick's manners i thought them particularly pleasing and i will answer for it they would generally please well well ladies are the best judges but james benwick is rather too piano for me and though very likely it is all our partiality sophy and i cannot help thinking frederick's manners better than his there is something about frederick more to our taste anne was caught she had only meant to oppose the too common idea of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other not at all to represent captain benwick's manners as the very best that could possibly be and after a little hesitation she was beginning to say i was not entering into any comparison
