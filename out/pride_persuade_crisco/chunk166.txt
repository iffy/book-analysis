at hand after the hints you gave just now which did but confirm my own observations the last time i was in company with him i need not affect to have no comprehension of what is going on i see that more than a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question and woe betide him and her too when it comes to things of consequence when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind if she have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this your sister is an amiable creature but yours is the character of decision and firmness i see if you value her conduct or happiness infuse as much of your own spirit into her as you can but this no doubt you have been always doing it is the worst evil of too yielding and indecisive a character that no influence over it can be depended on you are never sure of a good impression being durable everybody may sway it let those who would be happy be firm here is a nut said he catching one down from an upper bough to exemplify a beautiful glossy nut which blessed with original strength has outlived all the storms of autumn not a puncture not a weak spot anywhere this nut he continued with playful solemnity while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot is still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be supposed capable of then returning to his former earnest tone--my first wish for all whom i am interested in is that they should be firm if louisa musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her november of life she will cherish all her present powers of mind he had done and was unanswered it would have surprised anne if louisa could have readily answered such a speech words of such interest spoken with such serious warmth she could imagine what louisa was feeling for herself she feared to move lest she should be seen while she remained a bush of low rambling holly protected her and they were moving on before they were beyond her hearing however louisa spoke again mary is good-natured enough in many respects said she but she does sometimes provoke me excessively by her nonsense and pride--the elliot pride she has a great deal too much of the elliot pride we do so wish that charles had married anne instead i suppose you know he wanted to marry anne after a moment's pause captain wentworth said do you mean that she refused him oh yes certainly when did that happen i do not exactly know for henrietta and i were at school at the time but i believe about a year before he married mary i wish she had accepted him we should all have liked her a great deal better and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend lady russell's doing that she did not they think charles might not be learned and bookish enough to please lady russell and that therefore she persuaded anne to refuse him the sounds were retreating and anne distinguished no more her own emotions still kept her fixed she had much to recover from before she could move the listener's proverbial fate was not absolutely hers she had heard no evil of herself but she had heard a great deal of very painful import she saw how her own character was considered by captain wentworth and there had been just that degree of feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her extreme agitation as soon as she could she went after mary and having found and walked back with her to their former station by the stile felt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards collected and once more in motion together her spirits wanted the solitude and silence which only numbers could give charles and henrietta returned bringing as may be conjectured charles hayter with them the minutiae of the business anne could not attempt to understand even captain wentworth did not seem admitted to perfect confidence here but that there had been a withdrawing on the gentleman's side and a relenting on the lady's and that they were now very glad to be together again did not admit a doubt henrietta looked a little ashamed but very well pleased--charles hayter exceedingly happy and they were devoted to each other almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for uppercross everything now marked out louisa for captain wentworth nothing could be plainer and where many divisions were necessary or even where they were not they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two in a long strip of meadow land where there was ample space for all they were thus divided forming three distinct parties and to that party of the three which boasted least animation and least complaisance anne necessarily belonged she joined charles and mary and was tired enough to be very glad of charles's other arm but charles though in very good humour with her was out of temper with his wife mary had shewn herself disobliging to him and was now to reap the consequence which consequence was his dropping her arm almost every moment
