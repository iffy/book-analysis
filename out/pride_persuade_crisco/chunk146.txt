till lady russell took her and that all the intervening time should be divided between uppercross cottage and kellynch lodge so far all was perfectly right but lady russell was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the kellynch hall plan when it burst on her which was mrs clays being engaged to go to bath with sir walter and elizabeth as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in all the business before her lady russell was extremely sorry that such a measure should have been resorted to at all wondered grieved and feared and the affront it contained to anne in mrs clays being of so much use while anne could be of none was a very sore aggravation anne herself was become hardened to such affronts but she felt the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as lady russell with a great deal of quiet observation and a knowledge which she often wished less of her fathers character she was sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy were more than possible she did not imagine that her father had at present an idea of the kind mrs clay had freckles and a projecting tooth and a clumsy wrist which he was continually making severe remarks upon in her absence but she was young and certainly altogether well-looking and possessed in an acute mind and assiduous pleasing manners infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merely personal might have been anne was so impressed by the degree of their danger that she could not excuse herself from trying to make it perceptible to her sister she had little hope of success but elizabeth who in the event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than herself should never she thought have reason to reproach her for giving no warning she spoke and seemed only to offend elizabeth could not conceive how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her and indignantly answered for each partys perfectly knowing their situation mrs clay said she warmly never forgets who she is and as i am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be i can assure you that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people and as to my father i really should not have thought that he who has kept himself single so long for our sakes need be suspected now if mrs clay were a very beautiful woman i grant you it might be wrong to have her so much with me not that anything in the world i am sure would induce my father to make a degrading match but he might be rendered unhappy but poor mrs clay who with all her merits can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty i really think poor mrs clay may be staying here in perfect safety one would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes though i know you must fifty times that tooth of hers and those freckles freckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him i have known a face not materially disfigured by a few but he abominates them you must have heard him notice mrs clays freckles there is hardly any personal defect replied anne which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to i think very differently answered elizabeth shortly an agreeable manner may set off handsome features but can never alter plain ones however at any rate as i have a great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have i think it rather unnecessary in you to be advising me anne had done glad that it was over and not absolutely hopeless of doing good elizabeth though resenting the suspicion might yet be made observant by it the last office of the four carriage-horses was to draw sir walter miss elliot and mrs clay to bath the party drove off in very good spirits sir walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves and anne walked up at the same time in a sort of desolate tranquillity to the lodge where she was to spend the first week her friend was not in better spirits than herself lady russell felt this break-up of the family exceedingly their respectability was as dear to her as her own and a daily intercourse had become precious by habit it was painful to look upon their deserted grounds and still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village and be out of the way when admiral and mrs croft first arrived she had determined to make her own absence from home begin when she must give up anne accordingly their removal was made together and anne was set down at uppercross cottage in the first stage of lady russells journey uppercross was a moderate-sized village which a few years back had been completely in the old english style containing only two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers the mansion of the squire with its high walls great
