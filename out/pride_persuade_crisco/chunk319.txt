his efforts he seemed like one of the ancient titans who uprooted the mountains to hurl against the father of the gods the rock yielded rolled over bounded from point to point and finally disappeared in the ocean on the spot it had occupied was a circular space exposing an iron ring let into a square flag-stone dants uttered a cry of joy and surprise never had a first attempt been crowned with more perfect success he would fain have continued but his knees trembled and his heart beat so violently and his sight became so dim that he was forced to pause this feeling lasted but for a moment edmond inserted his lever in the ring and exerted all his strength the flag-stone yielded and disclosed steps that descended until they were lost in the obscurity of a subterraneous grotto anyone else would have rushed on with a cry of joy dants turned pale hesitated and reflected come said he to himself be a man i am accustomed to adversity i must not be cast down by the discovery that i have been deceived what then would be the use of all i have suffered the heart breaks when after having been elated by flattering hopes it sees all its illusions destroyed faria has dreamed this the cardinal spada buried no treasure here perhaps he never came here or if he did csar borgia the intrepid adventurer the stealthy and indefatigable plunderer has followed him discovered his traces pursued them as i have done raised the stone and descending before me has left me nothing he remained motionless and pensive his eyes fixed on the gloomy aperture that was open at his feet now that i expect nothing now that i no longer entertain the slightest hopes the end of this adventure becomes simply a matter of curiosity and he remained again motionless and thoughtful yes yes this is an adventure worthy a place in the varied career of that royal bandit this fabulous event formed but a link in a long chain of marvels yes borgia has been here a torch in one hand a sword in the other and within twenty paces at the foot of this rock perhaps two guards kept watch on land and sea while their master descended as i am about to descend dispelling the darkness before his awe-inspiring progress m but what was the fate of the guards who thus possessed his secret asked dants of himself the fate replied he smiling of those who buried alaric and were interred with the corpse yet had he come thought dants he would have found the treasure and borgia he who compared italy to an artichoke which he could devour leaf by leaf knew too well the value of time to waste it in replacing this rock i will go down then he descended a smile on his lips and murmuring that last word of human philosophy perhaps but instead of the darkness and the thick and mephitic atmosphere he had expected to find dants saw a dim and bluish light which as well as the air entered not merely by the aperture he had just formed but by the interstices and crevices of the rock which were visible from without and through which he could distinguish the blue sky and the waving branches of the evergreen oaks and the tendrils of the creepers that grew from the rocks after having stood a few minutes in the cavern the atmosphere of which was rather warm than damp dants eye habituated as it was to darkness could pierce even to the remotest angles of the cavern which was of granite that sparkled like diamonds alas said edmond smiling these are the treasures the cardinal has left and the good abb seeing in a dream these glittering walls has indulged in fallacious hopes but he called to mind the words of the will which he knew by heart in the farthest angle of the second opening said the cardinals will he had only found the first grotto he had now to seek the second dants continued his search he reflected that this second grotto must penetrate deeper into the island he examined the stones and sounded one part of the wall where he fancied the opening existed masked for precautions sake the pickaxe struck for a moment with a dull sound that drew out of dants forehead large drops of perspiration at last it seemed to him that one part of the wall gave forth a more hollow and deeper echo he eagerly advanced and with the quickness of perception that no one but a prisoner possesses saw that there in all probability the opening must be however he like csar borgia knew the value of time and in order to avoid fruitless toil he sounded all the other walls with his pickaxe struck the earth with the butt of his gun and finding nothing that appeared suspicious returned to that part of the wall whence issued the consoling sound he had before heard he again struck it and with greater force then a singular thing occurred as he struck the wall pieces of stucco similar to that used in the ground work of arabesques broke off and fell to the ground in flakes exposing a large white stone the aperture of the rock had been closed with
