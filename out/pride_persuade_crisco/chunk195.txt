she saw no reason against their being happy louisa had fine naval fervour to begin with and they would soon grow more alike he would gain cheerfulness and she would learn to be an enthusiast for scott and lord byron nay that was probably learnt already of course they had fallen in love over poetry the idea of louisa musgrove turned into a person of literary taste and sentimental reflection was amusing but she had no doubt of its being so the day at lyme the fall from the cobb might influence her health her nerves her courage her character to the end of her life as thoroughly as it appeared to have influenced her fate the conclusion of the whole was that if the woman who had been sensible of captain wentworths merits could be allowed to prefer another man there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder and if captain wentworth lost no friend by it certainly nothing to be regretted no it was not regret which made annes heart beat in spite of herself and brought the colour into her cheeks when she thought of captain wentworth unshackled and free she had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate they were too much like joy senseless joy she longed to see the crofts but when the meeting took place it was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them the visit of ceremony was paid and returned and louisa musgrove was mentioned and captain benwick too without even half a smile the crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in gay street perfectly to sir walters satisfaction he was not at all ashamed of the acquaintance and did in fact think and talk a great deal more about the admiral than the admiral ever thought or talked about him the crofts knew quite as many people in bath as they wished for and considered their intercourse with the elliots as a mere matter of form and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure they brought with them their country habit of being almost always together he was ordered to walk to keep off the gout and mrs croft seemed to go shares with him in everything and to walk for her life to do him good anne saw them wherever she went lady russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning and she never failed to think of them and never failed to see them knowing their feelings as she did it was a most attractive picture of happiness to her she always watched them as long as she could delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of as they walked along in happy independence or equally delighted to see the admirals hearty shake of the hand when he encountered an old friend and observe their eagerness of conversation when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy mrs croft looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her anne was too much engaged with lady russell to be often walking herself but it so happened that one morning about a week or ten days after the crofts arrival it suited her best to leave her friend or her friends carriage in the lower part of the town and return alone to camden place and in walking up milsom street she had the good fortune to meet with the admiral he was standing by himself at a printshop window with his hands behind him in earnest contemplation of some print and she not only might have passed him unseen but was obliged to touch as well as address him before she could catch his notice when he did perceive and acknowledge her however it was done with all his usual frankness and good humour ha is it you thank you thank you this is treating me like a friend here i am you see staring at a picture i can never get by this shop without stopping but what a thing here is by way of a boat do look at it did you ever see the like what queer fellows your fine painters must be to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless old cockleshell as that and yet here are two gentlemen stuck up in it mightily at their ease and looking about them at the rocks and mountains as if they were not to be upset the next moment which they certainly must be i wonder where that boat was built laughing heartily i would not venture over a horsepond in it well turning away now where are you bound can i go anywhere for you or with you can i be of any use none i thank you unless you will give me the pleasure of your company the little way our road lies together i am going home that i will with all my heart and farther too yes yes we will have a snug walk together and i have something to tell you as we go along there take my arm thats right i do not feel comfortable if i have not a woman there lord what a boat it is taking a last look at the picture as they began to be in motion did you say that you had something
