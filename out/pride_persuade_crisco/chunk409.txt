misanthropy certainly these are questions that in your place i should like to have answered my dear franz replied albert when upon receipt of my letter you found the necessity of asking the counts assistance you promptly went to him saying my friend albert de morcerf is in danger help me to deliver him was not that nearly what you said m it was well then did he ask you who is m albert de morcerf how does he come by his name his fortune what are his means of existence what is his birthplace of what country is he a native tell me did he put all these questions to you i confess he asked me none no he merely came and freed me from the hands of signor vampa where i can assure you in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and unconcern i did not very particularly care to remain now then franz when for services so promptly and unhesitatingly rendered he but asks me in return to do for him what is done daily for any russian prince or italian nobleman who may pass through paris merely to introduce him into society would you have me refuse my good fellow you must have lost your senses to think it possible i could act with such cold-blooded policy and this time it must be confessed that contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all on alberts side well said franz with a sigh do as you please my dear viscount for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation still in spite of all you must admit that this count of monte cristo is a most singular personage he is a philanthropist answered the other and no doubt his motive in visiting paris is to compete for the monthyon prize given as you are aware to whoever shall be proved to have most materially advanced the interests of virtue and humanity if my vote and interest can obtain it for him i will readily give him the one and promise the other and now my dear franz let us talk of something else come shall we take our luncheon and then pay a last visit to st peters franz silently assented and the following afternoon at half-past five oclock the young men parted albert de morcerf to return to paris and franz dpinay to pass a fortnight at venice but ere he entered his travelling carriage albert fearing that his expected guest might forget the engagement he had entered into placed in the care of a waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the count of monte cristo on which beneath the name of viscount albert de morcerf he had written in pencil rue du helder on the st may half-past ten am chapter the guests in the house in the rue du helder where albert had invited the count of monte cristo everything was being prepared on the morning of the st of may to do honor to the occasion albert de morcerf inhabited a pavilion situated at the corner of a large court and directly opposite another building in which were the servants apartments two windows only of the pavilion faced the street three other windows looked into the court and two at the back into the garden between the court and the garden built in the heavy style of the imperial architecture was the large and fashionable dwelling of the count and countess of morcerf a high wall surrounded the whole of the property surmounted at intervals by vases filled with flowers and broken in the centre by a large gate of gilded iron which served as the carriage entrance a small door close to the lodge of the concierge gave ingress and egress to the servants and masters when they were on foot it was easy to discover that the delicate care of a mother unwilling to part from her son and yet aware that a young man of the viscounts age required the full exercise of his liberty had chosen this habitation for albert there were not lacking however evidences of what we may call the intelligent egoism of a youth who is charmed with the indolent careless life of an only son and who lives as it were in a gilded cage by means of the two windows looking into the street albert could see all that passed the sight of what is going on is necessary to young men who always want to see the world traverse their horizon even if that horizon is only a public thoroughfare then should anything appear to merit a more minute examination albert de morcerf could follow up his researches by means of a small gate similar to that close to the concierges door and which merits a particular description it was a little entrance that seemed never to have been opened since the house was built so entirely was it covered with dust and dirt but the well-oiled hinges and locks told quite another story this door was a mockery to the concierge from whose vigilance and jurisdiction it was free and like that famous portal in the arabian nights opening at the sesame of ali baba it was wont to swing backward at a cabalistic word or a concerted
