released captain wentworth as well as herself he continued at the window and after calmly and politely saying i hope the little boy is better was silent she was obliged to kneel down by the sofa and remain there to satisfy her patient and thus they continued a few minutes when to her very great satisfaction she heard some other person crossing the little vestibule she hoped on turning her head to see the master of the house but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters easy--charles hayter probably not at all better pleased by the sight of captain wentworth than captain wentworth had been by the sight of anne she only attempted to say how do you do will you not sit down the others will be here presently captain wentworth however came from his window apparently not ill-disposed for conversation but charles hayter soon put an end to his attempts by seating himself near the table and taking up the newspaper and captain wentworth returned to his window another minute brought another addition the younger boy a remarkable stout forward child of two years old having got the door opened for him by some one without made his determined appearance among them and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away there being nothing to eat he could only have some play and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother he began to fasten himself upon her as she knelt in such a way that busy as she was about charles she could not shake him off she spoke to him ordered entreated and insisted in vain once she did contrive to push him away but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly walter said she get down this moment you are extremely troublesome i am very angry with you walter cried charles hayter why do you not do as you are bid do not you hear your aunt speak come to me walter come to cousin charles but not a bit did walter stir in another moment however she found herself in the state of being released from him some one was taking him from her though he had bent down her head so much that his little sturdy hands were unfastened from around her neck and he was resolutely borne away before she knew that captain wentworth had done it her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless she could not even thank him she could only hang over little charles with most disordered feelings his kindness in stepping forward to her relief the manner the silence in which it had passed the little particulars of the circumstance with the conviction soon forced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child that he meant to avoid hearing her thanks and rather sought to testify that her conversation was the last of his wants produced such a confusion of varying but very painful agitation as she could not recover from till enabled by the entrance of mary and the miss musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares and leave the room she could not stay it might have been an opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four--they were now altogether but she could stay for none of it it was evident that charles hayter was not well inclined towards captain wentworth she had a strong impression of his having said in a vext tone of voice after captain wentworth's interference you ought to have minded me walter i told you not to teaze your aunt and could comprehend his regretting that captain wentworth should do what he ought to have done himself but neither charles hayter's feelings nor anybody's feelings could interest her till she had a little better arranged her own she was ashamed of herself quite ashamed of being so nervous so overcome by such a trifle but so it was and it required a long application of solitude and reflection to recover her chapter other opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur anne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough to have an opinion though too wise to acknowledge as much at home where she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife for while she considered louisa to be rather the favourite she could not but think as far as she might dare to judge from memory and experience that captain wentworth was not in love with either they were more in love with him yet there it was not love it was a little fever of admiration but it might probably must end in love with some charles hayter seemed aware of being slighted and yet henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them anne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about and of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to she did not attribute guile to any it was the highest satisfaction to her to believe captain wentworth not in the least aware of the pain he was occasioning there was no triumph no pitiful triumph in his manner he had
