is this carriage for me said dants it is for you replied a gendarme dants was about to speak but feeling himself urged forward and having neither the power nor the intention to resist he mounted the steps and was in an instant seated inside between two gendarmes the two others took their places opposite and the carriage rolled heavily over the stones the prisoner glanced at the windows they were grated he had changed his prison for another that was conveying him he knew not whither through the grating however dants saw they were passing through the rue caisserie and by the rue saint-laurent and the rue taramis to the quay soon he saw the lights of la consigne the carriage stopped the officer descended approached the guardhouse a dozen soldiers came out and formed themselves in order dants saw the reflection of their muskets by the light of the lamps on the quay can all this force be summoned on my account thought he the officer opened the door which was locked and without speaking a word answered dants question for he saw between the ranks of the soldiers a passage formed from the carriage to the port the two gendarmes who were opposite to him descended first then he was ordered to alight and the gendarmes on each side of him followed his example they advanced towards a boat which a custom-house officer held by a chain near the quay the soldiers looked at dants with an air of stupid curiosity in an instant he was placed in the stern-sheets of the boat between the gendarmes while the officer stationed himself at the bow a shove sent the boat adrift and four sturdy oarsmen impelled it rapidly towards the pilon at a shout from the boat the chain that closes the mouth of the port was lowered and in a second they were as dants knew in the frioul and outside the inner harbor the prisoners first feeling was of joy at again breathing the pure air for air is freedom but he soon sighed for he passed before la rserve where he had that morning been so happy and now through the open windows came the laughter and revelry of a ball dants folded his hands raised his eyes to heaven and prayed fervently m the boat continued her voyage they had passed the tte de mort were now off the anse du pharo and about to double the battery this manuvre was incomprehensible to dants whither are you taking me asked he you will soon know but still we are forbidden to give you any explanation dants trained in discipline knew that nothing would be more absurd than to question subordinates who were forbidden to reply and so he remained silent the most vague and wild thoughts passed through his mind the boat they were in could not make a long voyage there was no vessel at anchor outside the harbor he thought perhaps they were going to leave him on some distant point he was not bound nor had they made any attempt to handcuff him this seemed a good augury besides had not the deputy who had been so kind to him told him that provided he did not pronounce the dreaded name of noirtier he had nothing to apprehend had not villefort in his presence destroyed the fatal letter the only proof against him he waited silently striving to pierce through the darkness they had left the ile ratonneau where the lighthouse stood on the right and were now opposite the point des catalans it seemed to the prisoner that he could distinguish a feminine form on the beach for it was there mercds dwelt how was it that a presentiment did not warn mercds that her lover was within three hundred yards of her one light alone was visible and dants saw that it came from mercds chamber mercds was the only one awake in the whole settlement a loud cry could be heard by her but pride restrained him and he did not utter it what would his guards think if they heard him shout like a madman he remained silent his eyes fixed upon the light the boat went on but the prisoner thought only of mercds an intervening elevation of land hid the light dants turned and perceived that they had got out to sea while he had been absorbed in thought they had shipped their oars and hoisted sail the boat was now moving with the wind in spite of his repugnance to address the guards dants turned to the nearest gendarme and taking his hand comrade said he i adjure you as a christian and a soldier to tell me where we are going i am captain dants a loyal frenchman thought accused of treason tell me where you are conducting me and i promise you on my honor i will submit to my fate the gendarme looked irresolutely at his companion who returned for answer a sign that said i see no great harm in telling him now and the gendarme replied you are a native of marseilles and a sailor and yet you do not know where you are going on my honor i have no idea have you no idea whatever none at all that is impossible i swear to you it is true tell
