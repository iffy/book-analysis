i can never forget the pale complexion and black eyes of the young soldier and whenever the angel of death summons me to another world i am quite sure i shall recognize selim i cannot tell you how long we remained in this state at that period i did not even know what time meant sometimes but very rarely my father summoned me and my mother to the terrace of the palace these were hours of recreation for me as i never saw anything in the dismal cavern but the gloomy countenances of the slaves and selims fiery lance my father was endeavoring to pierce with his eager looks the remotest verge of the horizon examining attentively every black speck which appeared on the lake while my mother reclining by his side rested her head on his shoulder and i played at his feet admiring everything i saw with that unsophisticated innocence of childhood which throws a charm round objects insignificant in themselves but which in its eyes are invested with the greatest importance the heights of pindus towered above us the castle of yanina rose white and angular from the blue waters of the lake and the immense masses of black vegetation which viewed in the distance gave the idea of lichens clinging to the rocks were in reality gigantic fir-trees and myrtles one morning my father sent for us my mother had been crying all the night and was very wretched we found the pasha calm but paler than usual take courage vasiliki said he today arrives the firman of the master and my fate will be decided if my pardon be complete we shall return triumphant to yanina if the news be inauspicious we must fly this night but supposing our enemy should not allow us to do so said my mother oh make yourself easy on that head said ali smiling selim and his flaming lance will settle that matter they would be glad to see me dead but they would not like themselves to die with me my mother only answered by sighs to consolations which she knew did not come from my fathers heart she prepared the iced water which he was in the habit of constantly drinking for since his sojourn at the kiosk he had been parched by the most violent fever after which she anointed his white beard with perfumed oil and lighted his chibouque which he sometimes smoked for hours together quietly watching the wreaths of vapor that ascended in spiral clouds and gradually melted away in the surrounding atmosphere presently he made such a sudden movement that i was paralyzed with fear then without taking his eyes from the object which had first attracted his attention he asked for his telescope my mother gave it him and as she did so looked whiter than the marble against which she leaned i saw my fathers hand tremble a boat two three murmured my father four he then arose seizing his arms and priming his pistols vasiliki said he to my mother trembling perceptibly the instant approaches which will decide everything in the space of half an hour we shall know the emperors answer go into the cavern with hayde i will not quit you said vasiliki if you die my lord i will die with you go to selim cried my father adieu my lord murmured my mother determining quietly to await the approach of death take away vasiliki said my father to his palikares as for me i had been forgotten in the general confusion i ran toward ali tepelini he saw me hold out my arms to him and he stooped down and pressed my forehead with his lips oh how distinctly i remember that kiss it was the last he ever gave me and i feel as if it were still warm on my forehead on descending we saw through the lattice-work several boats which were gradually becoming more distinct to our view at first they appeared like black specks and now they looked like birds skimming the surface of the waves during this time in the kiosk at my fathers feet were seated twenty palikares concealed from view by an angle of the wall and watching with eager eyes the arrival of the boats they were armed with their long guns inlaid with mother-of-pearl and silver and cartridges in great numbers were lying scattered on the floor my father looked at his watch and paced up and down with a countenance expressive of the greatest anguish this was the scene which presented itself to my view as i quitted my father after that last kiss my mother and i traversed the gloomy passage leading to the cavern selim was still at his post and smiled sadly on us as we entered we fetched our cushions from the other end of the cavern and sat down by selim in great dangers the devoted ones cling to each other and young as i was i quite understood that some imminent danger was hanging over our heads albert had often heard not from his father for he never spoke on the subject but from strangers the description of the last moments of the vizier of yanina he had read different accounts of his death but the story seemed to acquire fresh meaning from the voice and expression of the young girl
