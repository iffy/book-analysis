warn your excellency that the island is an infected port what do you mean monte cristo although uninhabited yet serves occasionally as a refuge for the smugglers and pirates who come from corsica sardinia and africa and if it becomes known that we have been there we shall have to perform quarantine for six days on our return to leghorn the deuce that puts a different face on the matter six days why thats as long as the almighty took to make the world too long a wait too long but who will say your excellency has been to monte cristo oh i shall not cried franz nor i nor i chorused the sailors then steer for monte cristo the captain gave his orders the helm was put up and the boat was soon sailing in the direction of the island franz waited until all was in order and when the sail was filled and the four sailors had taken their places three forward and one at the helm he resumed the conversation gaetano said he to the captain you tell me monte cristo serves as a refuge for pirates who are it seems to me a very different kind of game from the goats yes your excellency and it is true i knew there were smugglers but i thought that since the capture of algiers and the destruction of the regency pirates existed only in the romances of cooper and captain marryat your excellency is mistaken there are pirates like the bandits who were believed to have been exterminated by pope leo xii and who yet every day rob travellers at the gates of rome has not your excellency heard that the french charg daffaires was robbed six months ago within five hundred paces of velletri oh yes i heard that well then if like us your excellency lived at leghorn you would hear from time to time that a little merchant vessel or an english yacht that was expected at bastia at porto-ferrajo or at civita vecchia has not arrived no one knows what has become of it but doubtless it has struck on a rock and foundered now this rock it has met has been a long and narrow boat manned by six or eight men who have surprised and plundered it some dark and stormy night near some desert and gloomy island as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses of a forest but asked franz who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the boat why do not those who have been plundered complain to the french sardinian or tuscan governments why said gaetano with a smile yes why because in the first place they transfer from the vessel to their own boat whatever they think worth taking then they bind the crew hand and foot they attach to everyones neck a four-and-twenty-pound ball a large hole is chopped in the vessels bottom and then they leave her at the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and settle down first one gunl goes under then the other then they lift and sink again and both go under at once all at once theres a noise like a cannon thats the air blowing up the deck soon the water rushes out of the scupper-holes like a whale spouting the vessel gives a last groan spins round and round and disappears forming a vast whirlpool in the ocean and then all is over so that in five minutes nothing but the eye of god can see the vessel where she lies at the bottom of the sea do you understand now said the captain why no complaints are made to the government and why the vessel never reaches port it is probable that if gaetano had related this previous to proposing the expedition franz would have hesitated but now that they had started he thought it would be cowardly to draw back he was one of those men who do not rashly court danger but if danger presents itself combat it with the most unalterable coolness calm and resolute he treated any peril as he would an adversary in a duel calculated its probable method of approach retreated if at all as a point of strategy and not from cowardice was quick to see an opening for attack and won victory at a single thrust bah said he i have travelled through sicily and calabria i have sailed two months in the archipelago and yet i never saw even the shadow of a bandit or a pirate i did not tell your excellency this to deter you from your project replied gaetano but you questioned me and i have answered thats all yes and your conversation is most interesting and as i wish to enjoy it as long as possible steer for monte cristo the wind blew strongly the boat made six or seven knots an hour and they were rapidly reaching the end of their voyage as they drew near the island seemed to lift from the sea and the air was so clear that they could already distinguish the rocks heaped on one another like cannon balls in an arsenal with green bushes and trees growing in the crevices as for the sailors although they appeared perfectly tranquil yet it was evident that they were on the alert and that they
