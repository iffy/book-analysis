with soft languishing eyes a figure gracefully bending like a weeping willow the other a brunette with a fierce and haughty expression and as straight as a poplar it is unnecessary to state that in the eyes of the young man valentine did not suffer by the contrast in about half an hour the girls went away and maximilian understood that mademoiselle danglars visit had at last come to an end in a few minutes valentine re-entered the garden alone for fear that anyone should be observing her return she walked slowly and instead of immediately directing her steps towards the gate she seated herself on a bench and carefully casting her eyes around to convince herself that she was not watched she presently arose and proceeded quickly to join maximilian good-evening valentine said a well-known voice good-evening maximilian i know i have kept you waiting but you saw the cause of my delay yes i recognized mademoiselle danglars i was not aware that you were so intimate with her who told you we were intimate maximilian no one but you appeared to be so from the manner in which you walked and talked together one would have thought you were two school-girls telling your secrets to each other we were having a confidential conversation returned valentine she was owning to me her repugnance to the marriage with m de morcerf and i on the other hand was confessing to her how wretched it made me to think of marrying m dpinay dear valentine that will account to you for the unreserved manner which you observed between me and eugnie as in speaking of the man whom i could not love my thoughts involuntarily reverted to him on whom my affections were fixed ah how good you are to say so valentine you possess a quality which can never belong to mademoiselle danglars it is that indefinable charm which is to a woman what perfume is to the flower and flavor to the fruit for the beauty of either is not the only quality we seek it is your love which makes you look upon everything in that light no valentine i assure you such is not the case i was observing you both when you were walking in the garden and on my honor without at all wishing to depreciate the beauty of mademoiselle danglars i cannot understand how any man can really love her the fact is maximilian that i was there and my presence had the effect of rendering you unjust in your comparison no but tell me it is a question of simple curiosity and which was suggested by certain ideas passing in my mind relative to mademoiselle danglars i dare say it is something disparaging which you are going to say it only proves how little indulgence we may expect from your sex interrupted valentine you cannot at least deny that you are very harsh judges of each other if we are so it is because we generally judge under the influence of excitement but return to your question m does mademoiselle danglars object to this marriage with m de morcerf on account of loving another i told you i was not on terms of strict intimacy with eugnie yes but girls tell each other secrets without being particularly intimate own now that you did question her on the subject ah i see you are smiling if you are already aware of the conversation that passed the wooden partition which interposed between us and you has proved but a slight security come what did she say she told me that she loved no one said valentine that she disliked the idea of being married that she would infinitely prefer leading an independent and unfettered life and that she almost wished her father might lose his fortune that she might become an artist like her friend mademoiselle louise darmilly ah you see well what does that prove asked valentine nothing replied maximilian then why did you smile why you know very well that you are reflecting on yourself valentine do you want me to go away ah no no but do not let us lose time you are the subject on which i wish to speak true we must be quick for we have scarcely ten minutes more to pass together ma foi said maximilian in consternation yes you are right i am but a poor friend to you what a life i cause you to lead poor maximilian you who are formed for happiness i bitterly reproach myself i assure you well what does it signify valentine so long as i am satisfied and feel that even this long and painful suspense is amply repaid by five minutes of your society or two words from your lips and i have also a deep conviction that heaven would not have created two hearts harmonizing as ours do and almost miraculously brought us together to separate us at last those are kind and cheering words you must hope for us both maximilian that will make me at least partly happy but why must you leave me so soon i do not know particulars i can only tell you that madame de villefort sent to request my presence as she had a communication to make on which a part of my fortune depended let them take my fortune i am
