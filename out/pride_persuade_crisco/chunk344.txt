you promise i swear to you i will it is well adieu mademoiselle continue to be the good sweet girl you are at present and i have great hopes that heaven will reward you by giving you emmanuel for a husband julie uttered a faint cry blushed like a rose and leaned against the baluster the stranger waved his hand and continued to descend in the court he found penelon who with a rouleau of a hundred francs in either hand seemed unable to make up his mind to retain them come with me my friend said the englishman i wish to speak to you chapter the fifth of september the extension provided for by the agent of thomson french at the moment when morrel expected it least was to the poor shipowner so decided a stroke of good fortune that he almost dared to believe that fate was at length grown weary of wasting her spite upon him the same day he told his wife emmanuel and his daughter all that had occurred and a ray of hope if not of tranquillity returned to the family unfortunately however morrel had not only engagements with the house of thomson french who had shown themselves so considerate towards him and as he had said in business he had correspondents and not friends when he thought the matter over he could by no means account for this generous conduct on the part of thomson french towards him and could only attribute it to some such selfish argument as this we had better help a man who owes us nearly francs and have those francs at the end of three months than hasten his ruin and get only six or eight per cent of our money back again unfortunately whether through envy or stupidity all morrels correspondents did not take this view and some even came to a contrary decision the bills signed by morrel were presented at his office with scrupulous exactitude and thanks to the delay granted by the englishman were paid by cocles with equal punctuality cocles thus remained in his accustomed tranquillity it was morrel alone who remembered with alarm that if he had to repay on the th the francs of m de boville and on the th the francs of bills for which as well as the debt due to the inspector of prisons he had time granted he must be a ruined man the opinion of all the commercial men was that under the reverses which had successively weighed down morrel it was impossible for him to remain solvent great therefore was the astonishment when at the end of the month he cancelled all his obligations with his usual punctuality still confidence was not restored to all minds and the general opinion was that the complete ruin of the unfortunate shipowner had been postponed only until the end of the month the month passed and morrel made extraordinary efforts to get in all his resources formerly his paper at any date was taken with confidence and was even in request morrel now tried to negotiate bills at ninety days only and none of the banks would give him credit fortunately morrel had some funds coming in on which he could rely and as they reached him he found himself in a condition to meet his engagements when the end of july came the agent of thomson french had not been again seen at marseilles the day after or two days after his visit to morrel he had disappeared and as in that city he had had no intercourse but with the mayor the inspector of prisons and m morrel his departure left no trace except in the memories of these three persons as to the sailors of the pharaon they must have found snug berths elsewhere for they also had disappeared captain gaumard recovered from his illness had returned from palma he delayed presenting himself at morrels but the owner hearing of his arrival went to see him the worthy shipowner knew from penelons recital of the captains brave conduct during the storm and tried to console him he brought him also the amount of his wages which captain gaumard had not dared to apply for as he descended the staircase morrel met penelon who was going up penelon had it would seem made good use of his money for he was newly clad when he saw his employer the worthy tar seemed much embarrassed drew on one side into the corner of the landing-place passed his quid from one cheek to the other stared stupidly with his great eyes and only acknowledged the squeeze of the hand which morrel as usual gave him by a slight pressure in return morrel attributed penelons embarrassment to the elegance of his attire it was evident the good fellow had not gone to such an expense on his own account he was no doubt engaged on board some other vessel and thus his bashfulness arose from the fact of his not having if we may so express ourselves worn mourning for the pharaon longer perhaps he had come to tell captain gaumard of his good luck and to offer him employment from his new master worthy fellows said morrel as he went away may your new master love you as i loved you and be more fortunate than i have been
