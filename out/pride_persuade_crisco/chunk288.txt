conditions i furnished myself with a light you did pray tell me how i separated the fat from the meat served to me melted it and so made oil here is my lamp so saying the abb exhibited a sort of torch very similar to those used in public illuminations but how do you procure a light oh here are two flints and a piece of burnt linen and matches i pretended that i had a disorder of the skin and asked for a little sulphur which was readily supplied dants laid the different things he had been looking at on the table and stood with his head drooping on his breast as though overwhelmed by the perseverance and strength of farias mind m you have not seen all yet continued faria for i did not think it wise to trust all my treasures in the same hiding-place let us shut this one up they put the stone back in its place the abb sprinkled a little dust over it to conceal the traces of its having been removed rubbed his foot well on it to make it assume the same appearance as the other and then going towards his bed he removed it from the spot it stood in behind the head of the bed and concealed by a stone fitting in so closely as to defy all suspicion was a hollow space and in this space a ladder of cords between twenty-five and thirty feet in length dants closely and eagerly examined it he found it firm solid and compact enough to bear any weight who supplied you with the materials for making this wonderful work i tore up several of my shirts and ripped out the seams in the sheets of my bed during my three years imprisonment at fenestrelle and when i was removed to the chteau dif i managed to bring the ravellings with me so that i have been able to finish my work here and was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed oh no for when i had taken out the thread i required i hemmed the edges over again with what with this needle said the abb as opening his ragged vestments he showed dants a long sharp fish-bone with a small perforated eye for the thread a small portion of which still remained in it i once thought continued faria of removing these iron bars and letting myself down from the window which as you see is somewhat wider than yours although i should have enlarged it still more preparatory to my flight however i discovered that i should merely have dropped into a sort of inner court and i therefore renounced the project altogether as too full of risk and danger nevertheless i carefully preserved my ladder against one of those unforeseen opportunities of which i spoke just now and which sudden chance frequently brings about while affecting to be deeply engaged in examining the ladder the mind of dants was in fact busily occupied by the idea that a person so intelligent ingenious and clear-sighted as the abb might probably be able to solve the dark mystery of his own misfortunes where he himself could see nothing what are you thinking of asked the abb smilingly imputing the deep abstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe and wonder i was reflecting in the first place replied dants upon the enormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have employed to reach the high perfection to which you have attained what would you not have accomplished if you had been free possibly nothing at all the overflow of my brain would probably in a state of freedom have evaporated in a thousand follies misfortune is needed to bring to light the treasures of the human intellect compression is needed to explode gunpowder captivity has brought my mental faculties to a focus and you are well aware that from the collision of clouds electricity is produced from electricity lightning from lightning illumination no replied dants i know nothing some of your words are to me quite empty of meaning you must be blessed indeed to possess the knowledge you have the abb smiled well said he but you had another subject for your thoughts did you not say so just now i did you have told me as yet but one of them let me hear the other it was this that while you had related to me all the particulars of your past life you were perfectly unacquainted with mine your life my young friend has not been of sufficient length to admit of your having passed through any very important events it has been long enough to inflict on me a great and undeserved misfortune i would fain fix the source of it on man that i may no longer vent reproaches upon heaven then you profess ignorance of the crime with which you are charged i do indeed and this i swear by the two beings most dear to me upon earth my father and mercds come said the abb closing his hiding-place and pushing the bed back to its original situation let me hear your story dants obeyed and commenced what he called his history but which consisted only of the account of a voyage to india and two or three
