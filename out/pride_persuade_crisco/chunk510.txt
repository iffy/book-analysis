asked villefort yes what to do noirtier made no answer what do you want with a notary again repeated villefort the invalids eye remained fixed by which expression he intended to intimate that his resolution was unalterable is it to do us some ill turn do you think it is worth while said villefort still said barrois with the freedom and fidelity of an old servant if m noirtier asks for a notary i suppose he really wishes for a notary therefore i shall go at once and fetch one barrois acknowledged no master but noirtier and never allowed his desires in any way to be contradicted m yes i do want a notary motioned the old man shutting his eyes with a look of defiance which seemed to say and i should like to see the person who dares to refuse my request you shall have a notary as you absolutely wish for one sir said villefort but i shall explain to him your state of health and make excuses for you for the scene cannot fail of being a most ridiculous one never mind that said barrois i shall go and fetch a notary nevertheless and the old servant departed triumphantly on his mission chapter the will as soon as barrois had left the room noirtier looked at valentine with a malicious expression that said many things the young girl perfectly understood the look and so did villefort for his countenance became clouded and he knitted his eyebrows angrily he took a seat and quietly awaited the arrival of the notary noirtier saw him seat himself with an appearance of perfect indifference at the same time giving a side look at valentine which made her understand that she also was to remain in the room three-quarters of an hour after barrois returned bringing the notary with him sir said villefort after the first salutations were over you were sent for by m noirtier whom you see here all his limbs have become completely paralysed he has lost his voice also and we ourselves find much trouble in endeavoring to catch some fragments of his meaning noirtier cast an appealing look on valentine which look was at once so earnest and imperative that she answered immediately sir said she i perfectly understand my grandfathers meaning at all times that is quite true said barrois and that is what i told the gentleman as we walked along permit me said the notary turning first to villefort and then to valentine permit me to state that the case in question is just one of those in which a public officer like myself cannot proceed to act without thereby incurring a dangerous responsibility the first thing necessary to render an act valid is that the notary should be thoroughly convinced that he has faithfully interpreted the will and wishes of the person dictating the act now i cannot be sure of the approbation or disapprobation of a client who cannot speak and as the object of his desire or his repugnance cannot be clearly proved to me on account of his want of speech my services here would be quite useless and cannot be legally exercised the notary then prepared to retire an imperceptible smile of triumph was expressed on the lips of the procureur noirtier looked at valentine with an expression so full of grief that she arrested the departure of the notary sir said she the language which i speak with my grandfather may be easily learnt and i can teach you in a few minutes to understand it almost as well as i can myself will you tell me what you require in order to set your conscience quite at ease on the subject in order to render an act valid i must be certain of the approbation or disapprobation of my client illness of body would not affect the validity of the deed but sanity of mind is absolutely requisite well sir by the help of two signs with which i will acquaint you presently you may ascertain with perfect certainty that my grandfather is still in the full possession of all his mental faculties m noirtier being deprived of voice and motion is accustomed to convey his meaning by closing his eyes when he wishes to signify yes and to wink when he means no you now know quite enough to enable you to converse with m noirtier try noirtier gave valentine such a look of tenderness and gratitude that it was comprehended even by the notary himself you have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been saying sir have you asked the notary noirtier closed his eyes and you approve of what she said that is to say you declare that the signs which she mentioned are really those by means of which you are accustomed to convey your thoughts yes it was you who sent for me yes to make your will yes and you do not wish me to go away without fulfilling your original intentions the old man winked violently well sir said the young girl do you understand now and is your conscience perfectly at rest on the subject but before the notary could answer villefort had drawn him aside sir said he do you suppose for a moment that a man can sustain a physical shock such as m noirtier has received
