clothing whatever but talking of heat is there nothing i can offer you by way of refreshment yes let me have a bottle of your best wine and then with your permission we will resume our conversation from where we left off as you please sir said caderousse who anxious not to lose the present opportunity of finding a customer for one of the few bottles of cahors still remaining in his possession hastily raised a trap-door in the floor of the apartment they were in which served both as parlor and kitchen upon issuing forth from his subterranean retreat at the expiration of five minutes he found the abb seated upon a wooden stool leaning his elbow on a table while margotin whose animosity seemed appeased by the unusual command of the traveller for refreshments had crept up to him and had established himself very comfortably between his knees his long skinny neck resting on his lap while his dim eye was fixed earnestly on the travellers face are you quite alone inquired the guest as caderousse placed before him the bottle of wine and a glass quite quite alone replied the man or at least practically so for my poor wife who is the only person in the house besides myself is laid up with illness and unable to render me the least assistance poor thing you are married then said the priest with a show of interest glancing round as he spoke at the scanty furnishings of the apartment ah sir said caderousse with a sigh it is easy to perceive i am not a rich man but in this world a man does not thrive the better for being honest the abb fixed on him a searching penetrating glance yes honest i can certainly say that much for myself continued the innkeeper fairly sustaining the scrutiny of the abbs gaze i can boast with truth of being an honest man and continued he significantly with a hand on his breast and shaking his head that is more than everyone can say nowadays m so much the better for you if what you assert be true said the abb for i am firmly persuaded that sooner or later the good will be rewarded and the wicked punished such words as those belong to your profession answered caderousse and you do well to repeat them but added he with a bitter expression of countenance one is free to believe them or not as one pleases you are wrong to speak thus said the abb and perhaps i may in my own person be able to prove to you how completely you are in error what mean you inquired caderousse with a look of surprise in the first place i must be satisfied that you are the person i am in search of what proofs do you require did you in the year or know anything of a young sailor named dants dants did i know poor dear edmond why edmond dants and myself were intimate friends exclaimed caderousse whose countenance flushed darkly as he caught the penetrating gaze of the abb fixed on him while the clear calm eye of the questioner seemed to dilate with feverish scrutiny you remind me said the priest that the young man concerning whom i asked you was said to bear the name of edmond said to bear the name repeated caderousse becoming excited and eager why he was so called as truly as i myself bore the appellation of gaspard caderousse but tell me i pray what has become of poor edmond did you know him is he alive and at liberty is he prosperous and happy he died a more wretched hopeless heart-broken prisoner than the felons who pay the penalty of their crimes at the galleys of toulon a deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of caderousse who turned away and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes with the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his head poor fellow poor fellow murmured caderousse well there sir is another proof that good people are never rewarded on this earth and that none but the wicked prosper ah continued caderousse speaking in the highly colored language of the south the world grows worse and worse why does not god if he really hates the wicked as he is said to do send down brimstone and fire and consume them altogether you speak as though you had loved this young dants observed the abb without taking any notice of his companions vehemence and so i did replied caderousse though once i confess i envied him his good fortune but i swear to you sir i swear to you by everything a man holds dear i have since then deeply and sincerely lamented his unhappy fate there was a brief silence during which the fixed searching eye of the abb was employed in scrutinizing the agitated features of the innkeeper you knew the poor lad then continued caderousse i was called to see him on his dying bed that i might administer to him the consolations of religion and of what did he die asked caderousse in a choking voice of what think you do young and strong men die in prison when they have scarcely numbered their thirtieth year unless it be of imprisonment caderousse wiped away
