you have not the latest news from italy my information dates from the day on which i was arrested returned the abb faria and as the emperor had created the kingdom of rome for his infant son i presume that he has realized the dream of machiavelli and csar borgia which was to make italy a united kingdom monsieur returned the inspector providence has changed this gigantic plan you advocate so warmly it is the only means of rendering italy strong happy and independent very possibly only i am not come to discuss politics but to inquire if you have anything to ask or to complain of the food is the same as in other prisons that is very bad the lodging is very unhealthful but on the whole passable for a dungeon but it is not that which i wish to speak of but a secret i have to reveal of the greatest importance we are coming to the point whispered the governor it is for that reason i am delighted to see you continued the abb although you have disturbed me in a most important calculation which if it succeeded would possibly change newtons system could you allow me a few words in private what did i tell you said the governor you knew him returned the inspector with a smile what you ask is impossible monsieur continued he addressing faria m but said the abb i would speak to you of a large sum amounting to five millions the very sum you named whispered the inspector in his turn however continued faria seeing that the inspector was about to depart it is not absolutely necessary for us to be alone the governor can be present unfortunately said the governor i know beforehand what you are about to say it concerns your treasures does it not faria fixed his eyes on him with an expression that would have convinced anyone else of his sanity of course said he of what else should i speak mr inspector continued the governor i can tell you the story as well as he for it has been dinned in my ears for the last four or five years that proves returned the abb that you are like those of holy writ who having eyes see not and having ears hear not my dear sir the government is rich and does not want your treasures replied the inspector keep them until you are liberated the abbs eyes glistened he seized the inspectors hand but what if i am not liberated cried he and am detained here until my death this treasure will be lost had not government better profit by it i will offer six millions and i will content myself with the rest if they will only give me my liberty on my word said the inspector in a low tone had i not been told beforehand that this man was mad i should believe what he says i am not mad replied faria with that acuteness of hearing peculiar to prisoners the treasure i speak of really exists and i offer to sign an agreement with you in which i promise to lead you to the spot where you shall dig and if i deceive you bring me here again i ask no more the governor laughed is the spot far from here a hundred leagues it is not ill-planned said the governor if all the prisoners took it into their heads to travel a hundred leagues and their guardians consented to accompany them they would have a capital chance of escaping the scheme is well known said the inspector and the abbs plan has not even the merit of originality then turning to faria i inquired if you are well fed said he swear to me replied faria to free me if what i tell you prove true and i will stay here while you go to the spot are you well fed repeated the inspector monsieur you run no risk for as i told you i will stay here so there is no chance of my escaping you do not reply to my question replied the inspector impatiently nor you to mine cried the abb you will not accept my gold i will keep it for myself you refuse me my liberty god will give it me and the abb casting away his coverlet resumed his place and continued his calculations m what is he doing there said the inspector counting his treasures replied the governor faria replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound contempt they went out the turnkey closed the door behind them he was wealthy once perhaps said the inspector or dreamed he was and awoke mad after all said the inspector if he had been rich he would not have been here so the matter ended for the abb faria he remained in his cell and this visit only increased the belief in his insanity caligula or nero those treasure-seekers those desirers of the impossible would have accorded to the poor wretch in exchange for his wealth the liberty he so earnestly prayed for but the kings of modern times restrained by the limits of mere probability have neither courage nor desire they fear the ear that hears their orders and the eye that scrutinizes their actions formerly they believed themselves sprung from jupiter and
