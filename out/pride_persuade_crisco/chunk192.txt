be hereafter of a possible attachment on his side of the desirableness of the alliance supposing such attachment to be real and returned anne heard her and made no violent exclamations she only smiled blushed and gently shook her head i am no match-maker as you well know said lady russell being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations i only mean that if mr elliot should some time hence pay his addresses to you and if you should be disposed to accept him i think there would be every possibility of your being happy together a most suitable connection everybody must consider it but i think it might be a very happy one mr elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man and in many respects i think highly of him said anne but we should not suit lady russell let this pass and only said in rejoinder i own that to be able to regard you as the future mistress of kellynch the future lady elliot to look forward and see you occupying your dear mothers place succeeding to all her rights and all her popularity as well as to all her virtues would be the highest possible gratification to me you are your mothers self in countenance and disposition and if i might be allowed to fancy you such as she was in situation and name and home presiding and blessing in the same spot and only superior to her in being more highly valued my dearest anne it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life anne was obliged to turn away to rise to walk to a distant table and leaning there in pretended employment try to subdue the feelings this picture excited for a few moments her imagination and her heart were bewitched the idea of becoming what her mother had been of having the precious name of lady elliot first revived in herself of being restored to kellynch calling it her home again her home for ever was a charm which she could not immediately resist lady russell said not another word willing to leave the matter to its own operation and believing that could mr elliot at that moment with propriety have spoken for himself--she believed in short what anne did not believe the same image of mr elliot speaking for himself brought anne to composure again the charm of kellynch and of lady elliot all faded away she never could accept him and it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man save one her judgement on a serious consideration of the possibilities of such a case was against mr elliot though they had now been acquainted a month she could not be satisfied that she really knew his character that he was a sensible man an agreeable man that he talked well professed good opinions seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle this was all clear enough he certainly knew what was right nor could she fix on any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed but yet she would have been afraid to answer for his conduct she distrusted the past if not the present the names which occasionally dropt of former associates the allusions to former practices and pursuits suggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been she saw that there had been bad habits that sunday travelling had been a common thing that there had been a period of his life and probably not a short one when he had been at least careless in all serious matters and though he might now think very differently who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever cautious man grown old enough to appreciate a fair character how could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed mr elliot was rational discreet polished but he was not open there was never any burst of feeling any warmth of indignation or delight at the evil or good of others this to anne was a decided imperfection her early impressions were incurable she prized the frank the open-hearted the eager character beyond all others warmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still she felt that she could so much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked or said a careless or a hasty thing than of those whose presence of mind never varied whose tongue never slipped mr elliot was too generally agreeable various as were the tempers in her fathers house he pleased them all he endured too well stood too well with every body he had spoken to her with some degree of openness of mrs clay had appeared completely to see what mrs clay was about and to hold her in contempt and yet mrs clay found him as agreeable as any body lady russell saw either less or more than her young friend for she saw nothing to excite distrust she could not imagine a man more exactly what he ought to be than mr elliot nor did she ever enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive the hand of her beloved anne in kellynch church in the course of the following autumn chapter it was the beginning of february and anne having been a month in bath was growing very eager
