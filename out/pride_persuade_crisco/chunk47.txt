his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it your first position is false they may wish many things besides his happiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great connections and pride beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose miss darcy replied jane but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing they have known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love her better but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brothers what sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so they could not succeed by supposing such an affection you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong and me most unhappy do not distress me by the idea i am not ashamed of having been mistaken or at least it is light it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters let me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be understood elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time mr bingleys name was scarcely ever mentioned between them mrs bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly there was little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw her no more but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time she had the same story to repeat every day mrs bennets best comfort was that mr bingley must be down again in the summer mr bennet treated the matter differently so lizzy said he one day your sister is crossed in love i find i congratulate her next to being married a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then it is something to think of and it gives her a sort of distinction among her companions when is your turn to come you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane now is your time here are officers enough in meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country let wickham be your man he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditably thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me we must not all expect janes good fortune true said mr bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befall you you have an affectionate mother who will make the most of it mr wickhams society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family they saw him often and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve the whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on mr darcy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and everybody was pleased to know how much they had always disliked mr darcy before they had known anything of the matter miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of hertfordshire her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men chapter after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity mr collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday the pain of separation however might be alleviated on his side by preparations for the reception of his bride as he had reason to hope that shortly after his return into hertfordshire the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished his fair cousins health and happiness again and promised their father another letter of thanks on the following monday mrs bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn mr gardiner was a sensible gentlemanlike man greatly superior to his sister as well by nature as education the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so well-bred and agreeable mrs gardiner who was several years younger than mrs bennet and mrs phillips was an amiable intelligent elegant woman and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces between the two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a particular regard they had frequently been staying with her in town the first part of mrs gardiners business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions when
