how by introducing to you a new acquaintance a man or a woman a man i know so many men already but you do not know this man where does he come from the end of the world farther still perhaps the deuce i hope he does not bring our breakfast with him oh no our breakfast comes from my fathers kitchen are you hungry humiliating as such a confession is i am but i dined at m de villeforts and lawyers always give you very bad dinners you would think they felt some remorse did you ever remark that ah depreciate other persons dinners you ministers give such splendid ones yes but we do not invite people of fashion if we were not forced to entertain a parcel of country boobies because they think and vote with us we should never dream of dining at home i assure you well take another glass of sherry and another biscuit willingly your spanish wine is excellent you see we were quite right to pacify that country yes but don carlos well don carlos will drink bordeaux and in ten years we will marry his son to the little queen you will then obtain the golden fleece if you are still in the ministry i think albert you have adopted the system of feeding me on smoke this morning well you must allow it is the best thing for the stomach but i hear beauchamp in the next room you can dispute together and that will pass away the time about what about the papers my dear friend said lucien with an air of sovereign contempt do i ever read the papers then you will dispute the more m beauchamp announced the servant come in come in said albert rising and advancing to meet the young man here is debray who detests you without reading you so he says he is quite right returned beauchamp for i criticise him without knowing what he does good-day commander ah you know that already said the private secretary smiling and shaking hands with him pardieu and what do they say of it in the world in which world we have so many worlds in the year of grace in the entire political world of which you are one of the leaders they say that it is quite fair and that sowing so much red you ought to reap a little blue come come that is not bad said lucien why do you not join our party my dear beauchamp with your talents you would make your fortune in three or four years i only await one thing before following your advice that is a minister who will hold office for six months my dear albert one word for i must give poor lucien a respite do we breakfast or dine i must go to the chamber for our life is not an idle one you only breakfast i await two persons and the instant they arrive we shall sit down to table chapter the breakfast and what sort of persons do you expect to breakfast said beauchamp a gentleman and a diplomatist then we shall have to wait two hours for the gentleman and three for the diplomatist i shall come back to dessert keep me some strawberries coffee and cigars i shall take a cutlet on my way to the chamber do not do anything of the sort for were the gentleman a montmorency and the diplomatist a metternich we will breakfast at eleven in the meantime follow debrays example and take a glass of sherry and a biscuit be it so i will stay i must do something to distract my thoughts you are like debray and yet it seems to me that when the minister is out of spirits the opposition ought to be joyous ah you do not know with what i am threatened i shall hear this morning that m danglars make a speech at the chamber of deputies and at his wifes this evening i shall hear the tragedy of a peer of france the devil take the constitutional government and since we had our choice as they say at least how could we choose that i understand you must lay in a stock of hilarity do not run down m danglars speeches said debray he votes for you for he belongs to the opposition pardieu that is exactly the worst of all i am waiting until you send him to speak at the luxembourg to laugh at my ease my dear friend said albert to beauchamp it is plain that the affairs of spain are settled for you are most desperately out of humor this morning recollect that parisian gossip has spoken of a marriage between myself and mlle eugnie danglars i cannot in conscience therefore let you run down the speeches of a man who will one day say to me vicomte you know i give my daughter two millions ah this marriage will never take place said beauchamp the king has made him a baron and can make him a peer but he cannot make him a gentleman and the count of morcerf is too aristocratic to consent for the paltry sum of two million francs to a msalliance the viscount of morcerf can only wed a marchioness but two million francs make a nice little sum replied
