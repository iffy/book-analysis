with a deep blush that she had implied so much but less would hardly have been sufficient mrs smith would hardly have believed so soon in mr elliots failure but from the perception of there being a somebody else as it was she instantly submitted and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond and anne eager to escape farther notice was impatient to know why mrs smith should have fancied she was to marry mr elliot where she could have received the idea or from whom she could have heard it do tell me how it first came into your head it first came into my head replied mrs smith upon finding how much you were together and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in the same way but i never heard it spoken of till two days ago and has it indeed been spoken of did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when you called yesterday no was not it mrs speed as usual or the maid i observed no one in particular it was my friend mrs rooke nurse rooke who by-the-bye had a great curiosity to see you and was delighted to be in the way to let you in she came away from marlborough buildings only on sunday and she it was who told me you were to marry mr elliot she had had it from mrs wallis herself which did not seem bad authority she sat an hour with me on monday evening and gave me the whole history the whole history repeated anne laughing she could not make a very long history i think of one such little article of unfounded news mrs smith said nothing but continued anne presently though there is no truth in my having this claim on mr elliot i should be extremely happy to be of use to you in any way that i could shall i mention to him your being in bath shall i take any message no i thank you no certainly not in the warmth of the moment and under a mistaken impression i might perhaps have endeavoured to interest you in some circumstances but not now no i thank you i have nothing to trouble you with i think you spoke of having known mr elliot many years i did not before he was married i suppose yes he was not married when i knew him first and--were you much acquainted intimately indeed then do tell me what he was at that time of life i have a great curiosity to know what mr elliot was as a very young man was he at all such as he appears now i have not seen mr elliot these three years was mrs smiths answer given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther and anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity they were both silent mrs smith very thoughtful at last i beg your pardon my dear miss elliot she cried in her natural tone of cordiality i beg your pardon for the short answers i have been giving you but i have been uncertain what i ought to do i have been doubting and considering as to what i ought to tell you there were many things to be taken into the account one hates to be officious to be giving bad impressions making mischief even the smooth surface of family-union seems worth preserving though there may be nothing durable beneath however i have determined i think i am right i think you ought to be made acquainted with mr elliots real character though i fully believe that at present you have not the smallest intention of accepting him there is no saying what may happen you might some time or other be differently affected towards him hear the truth therefore now while you are unprejudiced mr elliot is a man without heart or conscience a designing wary cold-blooded being who thinks only of himself whom for his own interest or ease would be guilty of any cruelty or any treachery that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character he has no feeling for others those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction he is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion oh he is black at heart hollow and black annes astonished air and exclamation of wonder made her pause and in a calmer manner she added my expressions startle you you must allow for an injured angry woman but i will try to command myself i will not abuse him i will only tell you what i have found him facts shall speak he was the intimate friend of my dear husband who trusted and loved him and thought him as good as himself the intimacy had been formed before our marriage i found them most intimate friends and i too became excessively pleased with mr elliot and entertained the highest opinion of him at nineteen you know one does not think very seriously but mr elliot appeared to me quite as
