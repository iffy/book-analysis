little of what was said the voices soon ceased and it seemed to him as if everyone had left the cell still he dared not to enter as they might have left some turnkey to watch the dead he remained therefore mute and motionless hardly venturing to breathe at the end of an hour he heard a faint noise which increased it was the governor who returned followed by the doctor and other attendants there was a moments silence it was evident that the doctor was examining the dead body the inquiries soon commenced the doctor analyzed the symptoms of the malady to which the prisoner had succumbed and declared that he was dead questions and answers followed in a nonchalant manner that made dants indignant for he felt that all the world should have for the poor abb a love and respect equal to his own i am very sorry for what you tell me said the governor replying to the assurance of the doctor that the old man is really dead for he was a quiet inoffensive prisoner happy in his folly and required no watching ah added the turnkey there was no occasion for watching him he would have stayed here fifty years ill answer for it without any attempt to escape still said the governor i believe it will be requisite notwithstanding your certainty and not that i doubt your science but in discharge of my official duty that we should be perfectly assured that the prisoner is dead there was a moment of complete silence during which dants still listening knew that the doctor was examining the corpse a second time you may make your mind easy said the doctor he is dead i will answer for that you know sir said the governor persisting that we are not content in such cases as this with such a simple examination in spite of all appearances be so kind therefore as to finish your duty by fulfilling the formalities described by law let the irons be heated said the doctor but really it is a useless precaution this order to heat the irons made dants shudder he heard hasty steps the creaking of a door people going and coming and some minutes afterwards a turnkey entered saying here is the brazier lighted there was a moments silence and then was heard the crackling of burning flesh of which the peculiar and nauseous smell penetrated even behind the wall where dants was listening in horror the perspiration poured forth upon the young mans brow and he felt as if he should faint you see sir he is really dead said the doctor this burn in the heel is decisive the poor fool is cured of his folly and delivered from his captivity wasnt his name faria inquired one of the officers who accompanied the governor m yes sir and as he said it was an ancient name he was too very learned and rational enough on all points which did not relate to his treasure but on that indeed he was intractable it is the sort of malady which we call monomania said the doctor you had never anything to complain of said the governor to the jailer who had charge of the abb never sir replied the jailer never on the contrary he sometimes amused me very much by telling me stories one day too when my wife was ill he gave me a prescription which cured her ah ah said the doctor i did not know that i had a rival but i hope governor that you will show him all proper respect in consequence yes yes make your mind easy he shall be decently interred in the newest sack we can find will that satisfy you must this last formality take place in your presence sir inquired a turnkey certainly but make haste i cannot stay here all day other footsteps going and coming were now heard and a moment afterwards the noise of rustling canvas reached dants ears the bed creaked and the heavy footfall of a man who lifts a weight sounded on the floor then the bed again creaked under the weight deposited upon it this evening said the governor will there be any mass asked one of the attendants that is impossible replied the governor the chaplain of the chteau came to me yesterday to beg for leave of absence in order to take a trip to hyres for a week i told him i would attend to the prisoners in his absence if the poor abb had not been in such a hurry he might have had his requiem pooh pooh said the doctor with the impiety usual in persons of his profession he is a churchman god will respect his profession and not give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a priest a shout of laughter followed this brutal jest meanwhile the operation of putting the body in the sack was going on this evening said the governor when the task was ended at what hour inquired a turnkey why about ten or eleven oclock shall we watch by the corpse of what use would it be shut the dungeon as if he were alive that is all then the steps retreated and the voices died away in the distance the noise of the door with its creaking
