his promise he hurried him towards the house when they were gone morrel ventured out from under the trees and the moon shone upon his face which was so pale it might have been taken for that of a ghost i am manifestly protected in a most wonderful but most terrible manner said he but valentine poor girl how will she bear so much sorrow as he thought thus he looked alternately at the window with red curtains and the three windows with white curtains the light had almost disappeared from the former doubtless madame de villefort had just put out her lamp and the nightlamp alone reflected its dull light on the window at the extremity of the building on the contrary he saw one of the three windows open a wax-light placed on the mantle-piece threw some of its pale rays without and a shadow was seen for one moment on the balcony morrel shuddered he thought he heard a sob it cannot be wondered at that his mind generally so courageous but now disturbed by the two strongest human passions love and fear was weakened even to the indulgence of superstitious thoughts although it was impossible that valentine should see him hidden as he was he thought he heard the shadow at the window call him his disturbed mind told him so this double error became an irresistible reality and by one of the incomprehensible transports of youth he bounded from his hiding-place and with two strides at the risk of being seen at the risk of alarming valentine at the risk of being discovered by some exclamation which might escape the young girl he crossed the flower-garden which by the light of the moon resembled a large white lake and having passed the rows of orange-trees which extended in front of the house he reached the step ran quickly up and pushed the door which opened without offering any resistance valentine had not seen him her eyes raised towards heaven were watching a silvery cloud gliding over the azure its form that of a shadow mounting towards heaven her poetic and excited mind pictured it as the soul of her grandmother meanwhile morrel had traversed the anteroom and found the staircase which being carpeted prevented his approach being heard and he had regained that degree of confidence that the presence of m de villefort even would not have alarmed him he was quite prepared for any such encounter he would at once approach valentines father and acknowledge all begging villefort to pardon and sanction the love which united two fond and loving hearts morrel was mad happily he did not meet anyone now especially did he find the description valentine had given of the interior of the house useful to him he arrived safely at the top of the staircase and while he was feeling his way a sob indicated the direction he was to take he turned back a door partly open enabled him to see his road and to hear the voice of one in sorrow he pushed the door open and entered at the other end of the room under a white sheet which covered it lay the corpse still more alarming to morrel since the account he had so unexpectedly overheard by its side on her knees and with her head buried in the cushion of an easy-chair was valentine trembling and sobbing her hands extended above her head clasped and stiff she had turned from the window which remained open and was praying in accents that would have affected the most unfeeling her words were rapid incoherent unintelligible for the burning weight of grief almost stopped her utterance the moon shining through the open blinds made the lamp appear to burn paler and cast a sepulchral hue over the whole scene morrel could not resist this he was not exemplary for piety he was not easily impressed but valentine suffering weeping wringing her hands before him was more than he could bear in silence he sighed and whispered a name and the head bathed in tears and pressed on the velvet cushion of the chair a head like that of a magdalen by correggio was raised and turned towards him valentine perceived him without betraying the least surprise a heart overwhelmed with one great grief is insensible to minor emotions morrel held out his hand to her valentine as her only apology for not having met him pointed to the corpse under the sheet and began to sob again neither dared for some time to speak in that room they hesitated to break the silence which death seemed to impose at length valentine ventured my friend said she how came you here alas i would say you are welcome had not death opened the way for you into this house valentine said morrel with a trembling voice i had waited since half-past eight and did not see you come i became uneasy leaped the wall found my way through the garden when voices conversing about the fatal event what voices asked valentine morrel shuddered as he thought of the conversation of the doctor and m de villefort and he thought he could see through the sheet the extended hands the stiff neck and the purple lips your servants said he who were repeating the whole of the sorrowful story from them i learned
