parish as a sort of take-leave i was told that they wished it but all these things took up a great deal of time oh well and after a moments pause but you have never asked me one word about our dinner at the pooles yesterday did you go then i have made no enquiries because i concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party oh yes i went i was very well yesterday nothing at all the matter with me till this morning it would have been strange if i had not gone i am very glad you were well enough and i hope you had a pleasant party nothing remarkable one always knows beforehand what the dinner will be and who will be there and it is so very uncomfortable not having a carriage of ones own mr and mrs musgrove took me and we were so crowded they are both so very large and take up so much room and mr musgrove always sits forward so there was i crowded into the back seat with henrietta and louisa and i think it very likely that my illness to-day may be owing to it a little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on annes side produced nearly a cure on marys she could soon sit upright on the sofa and began to hope she might be able to leave it by dinner-time then forgetting to think of it she was at the other end of the room beautifying a nosegay then she ate her cold meat and then she was well enough to propose a little walk where shall we go said she when they were ready i suppose you will not like to call at the great house before they have been to see you i have not the smallest objection on that account replied anne i should never think of standing on such ceremony with people i know so well as mrs and the miss musgroves oh but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible they ought to feel what is due to you as my sister however we may as well go and sit with them a little while and when we have that over we can enjoy our walk anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent but she had ceased to endeavour to check it from believing that though there were on each side continual subjects of offence neither family could now do without it to the great house accordingly they went to sit the full half hour in the old-fashioned square parlour with a small carpet and shining floor to which the present daughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion by a grand piano-forte and a harp flower-stands and little tables placed in every direction oh could the originals of the portraits against the wainscot could the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on have been conscious of such an overthrow of all order and neatness the portraits themselves seemed to be staring in astonishment the musgroves like their houses were in a state of alteration perhaps of improvement the father and mother were in the old english style and the young people in the new mr and mrs musgrove were a very good sort of people friendly and hospitable not much educated and not at all elegant their children had more modern minds and manners there was a numerous family but the only two grown up excepting charles were henrietta and louisa young ladies of nineteen and twenty who had brought from school at exeter all the usual stock of accomplishments and were now like thousands of other young ladies living to be fashionable happy and merry their dress had every advantage their faces were rather pretty their spirits extremely good their manner unembarrassed and pleasant they were of consequence at home and favourites abroad anne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures of her acquaintance but still saved as we all are by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility of exchange she would not have given up her own more elegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments and envied them nothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together that good-humoured mutual affection of which she had known so little herself with either of her sisters they were received with great cordiality nothing seemed amiss on the side of the great house family which was generally as anne very well knew the least to blame the half hour was chatted away pleasantly enough and she was not at all surprised at the end of it to have their walking party joined by both the miss musgroves at marys particular invitation chapter anne had not wanted this visit to uppercross to learn that a removal from one set of people to another though at a distance of only three miles will often include a total change of conversation opinion and idea she had never been staying there before without being struck by it or without wishing that other elliots could have her advantage in seeing how unknown or unconsidered there were the affairs which at kellynch hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervading interest yet with all this
