on signor pastrini turned toward franz who seemed to him the more reasonable of the two we must do him justice he had had a great many frenchmen in his house but had never been able to comprehend them excellency said he gravely addressing franz if you look upon me as a liar it is useless for me to say anything it was for your interest i albert does not say you are a liar signor pastrini said franz but that he will not believe what you are going to tell us but i will believe all you say so proceed but if your excellency doubt my veracity signor pastrini returned franz you are more susceptible than cassandra who was a prophetess and yet no one believed her while you at least are sure of the credence of half your audience come sit down and tell us all about this signor vampa i had told your excellency he is the most famous bandit we have had since the days of mastrilla well what has this bandit to do with the order i have given the coachman to leave the city by the porta del popolo and to re-enter by the porta san giovanni m this replied signor pastrini that you will go out by one but i very much doubt your returning by the other why asked franz because after nightfall you are not safe fifty yards from the gates on your honor is that true cried albert count returned signor pastrini hurt at alberts repeated doubts of the truth of his assertions i do not say this to you but to your companion who knows rome and knows too that these things are not to be laughed at my dear fellow said albert turning to franz here is an admirable adventure we will fill our carriage with pistols blunderbusses and double-barrelled guns luigi vampa comes to take us and we take him we bring him back to rome and present him to his holiness the pope who asks how he can repay so great a service then we merely ask for a carriage and a pair of horses and we see the carnival in the carriage and doubtless the roman people will crown us at the capitol and proclaim us like curtius and horatius cocles the preservers of their country whilst albert proposed this scheme signor pastrinis face assumed an expression impossible to describe and pray asked franz where are these pistols blunderbusses and other deadly weapons with which you intend filling the carriage not out of my armory for at terracina i was plundered even of my hunting-knife and you i shared the same fate at aquapendente do you know signor pastrini said albert lighting a second cigar at the first that this practice is very convenient for bandits and that it seems to be due to an arrangement of their own doubtless signor pastrini found this pleasantry compromising for he only answered half the question and then he spoke to franz as the only one likely to listen with attention your excellency knows that it is not customary to defend yourself when attacked by bandits what cried albert whose courage revolted at the idea of being plundered tamely not make any resistance no for it would be useless what could you do against a dozen bandits who spring out of some pit ruin or aqueduct and level their pieces at you eh parbleu they should kill me the innkeeper turned to franz with an air that seemed to say your friend is decidedly mad my dear albert returned franz your answer is sublime and worthy the let him die of corneille only when horace made that answer the safety of rome was concerned but as for us it is only to gratify a whim and it would be ridiculous to risk our lives for so foolish a motive albert poured himself out a glass of lacryma christi which he sipped at intervals muttering some unintelligible words well signor pastrini said franz now that my companion is quieted and you have seen how peaceful my intentions are tell me who is this luigi vampa is he a shepherd or a nobleman young or old tall or short describe him in order that if we meet him by chance like jean sbogar or lara we may recognize him you could not apply to anyone better able to inform you on all these points for i knew him when he was a child and one day that i fell into his hands going from ferentino to alatri he fortunately for me recollected me and set me free not only without ransom but made me a present of a very splendid watch and related his history to me let us see the watch said albert signor pastrini drew from his fob a magnificent brguet bearing the name of its maker of parisian manufacture and a counts coronet here it is said he peste returned albert i compliment you on it i have its fellow he took his watch from his waistcoat pocket and it cost me francs let us hear the history said franz motioning signor pastrini to seat himself your excellencies permit it asked the host pardieu cried albert you are not a preacher to remain standing the host sat down after having made each of them a respectful bow which meant
