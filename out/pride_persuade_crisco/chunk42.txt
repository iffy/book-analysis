was nothing else than to secure her from any return of mr collinss addresses by engaging them towards herself such was miss lucass scheme and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success might be known likewise for though feeling almost secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday his reception however was of the most flattering kind miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there in as short a time as mr collinss long speeches would allow everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that establishment were gained sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity mr collinss present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom they could give little fortune and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer mr bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st jamess the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion the younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlottes dying an old maid charlotte herself was tolerably composed she had gained her point and had time to consider of it her reflections were in general satisfactory mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary but still he would be her husband without thinking highly either of men or matrimony marriage had always been her object it was the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest preservative from want this preservative she had now obtained and at the age of twenty-seven without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation she resolved to give her the information herself and therefore charged mr collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial for he was longing to publish his prosperous love as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night and mrs bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever his engagements might allow him to visit them my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible they were all astonished and mr bennet who could by no means wish for so speedy a return immediately said but is there not danger of lady catherines disapprobation here my good sir you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness my dear sir replied mr collins i am particularly obliged to you
