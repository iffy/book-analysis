render you this slight service also he extended his hand and rang the bell thrice did you ever occupy yourself said he to franz with the employment of time and the means of simplifying the summoning your servants i have when i ring once it is for my valet twice for my majordomo thrice for my steward thus i do not waste a minute or a word here he is a man of about forty-five or fifty entered exactly resembling the smuggler who had introduced franz into the cavern but he did not appear to recognize him it was evident he had his orders monsieur bertuccio said the count you have procured me windows looking on the piazza del popolo as i ordered you yesterday yes excellency returned the steward but it was very late did i not tell you i wished for one replied the count frowning and your excellency has one which was let to prince lobanieff but i was obliged to pay a hundred that will do that will do monsieur bertuccio spare these gentlemen all such domestic arrangements you have the window that is sufficient give orders to the coachman and be in readiness on the stairs to conduct us to it the steward bowed and was about to quit the room ah continued the count be good enough to ask pastrini if he has received the tavoletta and if he can send us an account of the execution there is no need to do that said franz taking out his tablets for i saw the account and copied it down very well you can retire m bertuccio i need you no longer let us know when breakfast is ready these gentlemen added he turning to the two friends will i trust do me the honor to breakfast with me but my dear count said albert we shall abuse your kindness not at all on the contrary you will give me great pleasure you will one or other of you perhaps both return it to me at paris m bertuccio lay covers for three he then took franzs tablets out of his hand we announce he read in the same tone with which he would have read a newspaper that today the rd of february will be executed andrea rondolo guilty of murder on the person of the respected and venerated don csar torlini canon of the church of st john lateran and peppino called rocca priori convicted of complicity with the detestable bandit luigi vampa and the men of his band hum the first will be mazzolato the second decapitato yes continued the count it was at first arranged in this way but i think since yesterday some change has taken place in the order of the ceremony really said franz yes i passed the evening at the cardinal rospigliosis and there mention was made of something like a pardon for one of the two men for andrea rondolo asked franz no replied the count carelessly for the other he glanced at the tablets as if to recall the name for peppino called rocca priori you are thus deprived of seeing a man guillotined but the mazzolata still remains which is a very curious punishment when seen for the first time and even the second while the other as you must know is very simple the mandaa never fails never trembles never strikes thirty times ineffectually like the soldier who beheaded the count of chalais and to whose tender mercy richelieu had doubtless recommended the sufferer ah added the count in a contemptuous tone do not tell me of european punishments they are in the infancy or rather the old age of cruelty really count replied franz one would think that you had studied the different tortures of all the nations of the world there are at least few that i have not seen said the count coldly and you took pleasure in beholding these dreadful spectacles my first sentiment was horror the second indifference the third curiosity curiosity that is a terrible word why so in life our greatest preoccupation is death is it not then curious to study the different ways by which the soul and body can part and how according to their different characters temperaments and even the different customs of their countries different persons bear the transition from life to death from existence to annihilation as for myself i can assure you of one thing the more men you see die the easier it becomes to die yourself and in my opinion death may be a torture but it is not an expiation i do not quite understand you replied franz pray explain your meaning for you excite my curiosity to the highest pitch listen said the count and deep hatred mounted to his face as the blood would to the face of any other if a man had by unheard-of and excruciating tortures destroyed your father your mother your betrothed a being who when torn from you left a desolation a wound that never closes in your breast do you think the reparation that society gives you is sufficient when it interposes the knife of the guillotine between the base of the occiput and the trapezal muscles of the murderer and allows him who has caused us years of moral sufferings to escape with a few moments of physical pain yes
