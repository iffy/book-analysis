at finding after an absence of nine months that you had been enceinte six i am brutal i not only allow it but boast of it it is one of the reasons of my success in commercial business why did he kill himself instead of you because he had no cash to save my life belongs to my cash m debray has made me lose francs let him bear his share of the loss and we will go on as before if not let him become bankrupt for the livres and do as all bankrupts do disappear he is a charming fellow i allow when his news is correct but when it is not there are fifty others in the world who would do better than he madame danglars was rooted to the spot she made a violent effort to reply to this last attack but she fell upon a chair thinking of villefort of the dinner scene of the strange series of misfortunes which had taken place in her house during the last few days and changed the usual calm of her establishment to a scene of scandalous debate danglars did not even look at her though she did her best to faint he shut the bedroom door after him without adding another word and returned to his apartments and when madame danglars recovered from her half-fainting condition she could almost believe that she had had a disagreeable dream chapter matrimonial projects the day following this scene at the hour debray usually chose to pay a visit to madame danglars on his way to his office his coup did not appear at this time that is about half-past twelve madame danglars ordered her carriage and went out danglars hidden behind a curtain watched the departure he had been waiting for he gave orders that he should be informed as soon as madame danglars appeared but at two oclock she had not returned he then called for his horses drove to the chamber and inscribed his name to speak against the budget from twelve to two oclock danglars had remained in his study unsealing his dispatches and becoming more and more sad every minute heaping figure upon figure and receiving among other visits one from major cavalcanti who as stiff and exact as ever presented himself precisely at the hour named the night before to terminate his business with the banker on leaving the chamber danglars who had shown violent marks of agitation during the sitting and been more bitter than ever against the ministry re-entered his carriage and told the coachman to drive to the avenue des champs-lyses no monte cristo was at home only he was engaged with someone and begged danglars to wait for a moment in the drawing-room while the banker was waiting in the anteroom the door opened and a man dressed as an abb and doubtless more familiar with the house than he was came in and instead of waiting merely bowed passed on to the farther apartments and disappeared a minute after the door by which the priest had entered reopened and monte cristo appeared pardon me said he my dear baron but one of my friends the abb busoni whom you perhaps saw pass by has just arrived in paris not having seen him for a long time i could not make up my mind to leave him sooner so i hope this will be sufficient reason for my having made you wait nay said danglars it is my fault i have chosen my visit at a wrong time and will retire not at all on the contrary be seated but what is the matter with you you look careworn really you alarm me melancholy in a capitalist like the appearance of a comet presages some misfortune to the world i have been in ill-luck for several days said danglars and i have heard nothing but bad news ah indeed said monte cristo have you had another fall at the bourse no i am safe for a few days at least i am only annoyed about a bankrupt of trieste really does it happen to be jacopo manfredi exactly so imagine a man who has transacted business with me for i dont know how long to the amount of or francs during the year never a mistake or delay a fellow who paid like a prince well i was a million in advance with him and now my fine jacopo manfredi suspends payment really it is an unheard-of fatality i draw upon him for francs my bills are returned unpaid and more than that i hold bills of exchange signed by him to the value of francs payable at his correspondents in paris at the end of this month today is the th i present them but my correspondent has disappeared this with my spanish affairs made a pretty end to the month then you really lost by that affair in spain yes only francs out of my cash box nothing more why how could you make such a mistake such an old stager oh it is all my wifes fault she dreamed don carlos had returned to spain she believes in dreams it is magnetism she says and when she dreams a thing it is sure to happen she assures me on this conviction i allow her to speculate she having her bank
