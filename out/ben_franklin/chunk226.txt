this incident i thought it likely that if i were to remain in england and open a swimming-school i might get a good deal of money and it struck me so strongly that had the overture been sooner made me probably i should not so soon have returned to america after many years you and i had something of more importance to do with one of these sons of sir william wyndham become earl of egremont which i shall mention in its place thus i spent about eighteen months in london most part of the time i work'd hard at my business
