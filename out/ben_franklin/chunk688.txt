friend what poor richard says employ thy time well if thou meanest to gain leisure and since thou art not sure of a minute throw not away an hour leisure is time for doing something useful this leisure the diligent man will obtain but the lazy man never so that as poor richard says a life of leisure and a life of laziness are two things keep thy shop and thy shop will keep thee and again if you would have your business done go if not send if you would have a faithful servant and one that you like serve
