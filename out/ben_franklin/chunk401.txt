members being annual a new member made a long speech against me in order to favour some other candidate i was however chosen which was the more agreeable to me as besides the pay for the immediate service as clerk the place gave me a better opportunity of keeping up an interest among the members which securd to me the business of printing the votes laws paper money and other occasional jobbs for the public that on the whole were very profitable i therefore did not like the opposition of this new member who was a gentleman of fortune and education
