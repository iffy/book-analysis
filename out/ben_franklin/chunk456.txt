reminds me of what i think a more prudent conduct in another sect among us that of the dunkers i was acquainted with one of its founders michael welfare soon after it appeard he complaind to me that they were grievously calumniated by the zealots of other persuasions and chargd with abominable principles and practices to which they were utter strangers i told him this had always been the case with new sects and that to put a stop to such abuse i imagind it might be well to publish the articles of their belief and the rules of their discipline
