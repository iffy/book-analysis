will not take me long to describe it i am a widower and have an only son arthur he has been a disappointment to me mr holmes a grievous disappointment i have no doubt that i am myself to blame people tell me that i have spoiled him very likely i have when my dear wife died i felt that he was all i had to love i could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face i have never denied him a wish perhaps it would have been better for both of us had i been sterner but i meant it for the best it was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business but he was not of a business turn he was wild wayward and to speak the truth
