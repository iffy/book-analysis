know i am sorry that miss sutherland has troubled you about this little matter for i think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public it was quite against my wishes that she came but she is a very excitable impulsive girl as you may have noticed and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point of course i did not mind you so much as you are not connected with the official police but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad besides it is a useless expense for how could you possibly find this hosmer angel on the contrary said holmes quietly i have every reason to believe that i will succeed in discovering mr hosmer angel mr windibank gave a violent start
