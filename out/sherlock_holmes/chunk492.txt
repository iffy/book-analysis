time how is that i asked when i had finished capital between your brandy and your bandage i feel a new man i was very weak but i have had a good deal to go through perhaps you had better not speak of the matter it is evidently trying to your nerves oh no not now i shall have to tell my tale to the police but between ourselves if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine i should be surprised if they believed my statement for it is a very extraordinary one and i have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up and even if they believe me the clues which i can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done ha
