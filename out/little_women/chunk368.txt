wedding the june roses over the porch were awake bright and early on that morning rejoicing with all their hearts in the cloudless sunshine like friendly little neighbors as they were quite flushed with excitement were their ruddy faces as they swung in the wind whispering to one another what they had seen for some peeped in at the dining room windows where the feast was spread some climbed up to nod and smile at the sisters as they dressed the bride others waved a welcome to those who came and went on various errands in garden porch and hall and all from the rosiest full-blown flower to the palest baby bud offered their tribute of beauty and fragrance to the gentle mistress who had loved and tended them so long meg looked very like a rose herself for all that was best and sweetest in heart and soul seemed to bloom into her face that day making it fair and tender with a charm more beautiful than beauty neither silk lace nor orange flowers would she have i dont want a fashionable wedding but only those about me whom i love and to them i wish to look and be my familiar self so she made her wedding gown herself sewing into it the tender hopes and innocent romances of a girlish heart her sisters braided up her pretty hair and the only ornaments she wore were the lilies of the valley which her john liked best of all the flowers
