wish i was going to college you dont look as if you liked it i hate it nothing but grinding or skylarking and i dont like the way fellows do either in this country what do you like to live in italy and to enjoy myself in my own way jo wanted very much to ask what his own way was but his black brows looked rather threatening as he knit them so she changed the subject by saying as her foot kept time thats a splendid polka why dont you go and try it if you will come too he answered with a gallant little bow i cant for i told meg i wouldnt because there jo stopped and looked undecided whether to tell or to laugh because what you wont tell never well i have a bad trick of standing before the fire and so i burn my frocks and i scorched this one and though its nicely mended it shows and meg told me to keep still so no one would see it you may laugh if you want to it is funny i know but laurie didnt laugh he only looked down a minute and the expression of his face puzzled jo when he said very gently never mind that ill tell you how we can manage theres a long hall out there and we can dance grandly and no one will see us please come jo thanked him and gladly went wishing she had two neat gloves
