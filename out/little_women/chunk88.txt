mrs march the boy neglects his music now and im glad of it for he was getting too fond of it but the piano suffers for want of use wouldnt some of your girls like to run over and practice on it now and then just to keep it in tune you know maam beth took a step forward and pressed her hands tightly together to keep from clapping them for this was an irresistible temptation and the thought of practicing on that splendid instrument quite took her breath away before mrs march could reply mr laurence went on with an odd little nod and smile they neednt see or speak to anyone but run in at any time for im shut up in my study at the other end of the house laurie is out a great deal and the servants are never near the drawing room after nine oclock here he rose as if going and beth made up her mind to speak for that last arrangement left nothing to be desired please tell the young ladies what i say and if they dont care to come why never mind here a little hand slipped into his and beth looked up at him with a face full of gratitude as she said in her earnest yet timid way oh sir they do care very very much are you the musical girl he asked without any startling hey as he looked down at her very kindly im beth i love it
