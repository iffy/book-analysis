believe the happy truth the doctor came to confirm it he was a homely man but they thought his face quite heavenly when he smiled and said with a fatherly look at them yes my dears i think the little girl will pull through this time keep the house quiet let her sleep and when she wakes give her what they were to give neither heard for both crept into the dark hall and sitting on the stairs held each other close rejoicing with hearts too full for words when they went back to be kissed and cuddled by faithful hannah they found beth lying as she used to do with her cheek pillowed on her hand the dreadful pallor gone and breathing quietly as if just fallen asleep if mother would only come now said jo as the winter night began to wane see said meg coming up with a white half-opened rose i thought this would hardly be ready to lay in beths hand tomorrow if she went away from us but it has blossomed in the night and now i mean to put it in my vase here so that when the darling wakes the first thing she sees will be the little rose and mothers face never had the sun risen so beautifully and never had the world seemed so lovely as it did to the heavy eyes of meg and jo as they looked out in the early morning when their long sad vigil was done it
