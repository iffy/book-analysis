a great tear dropped on the golden hair of the sleeping child in her arms for her one well-beloved daughter was a frail little creature and the dread of losing her was the shadow over amys sunshine this cross was doing much for both father and mother for one love and sorrow bound them closely together amys nature was growing sweeter deeper and more tender laurie was growing more serious strong and firm and both were learning that beauty youth good fortune even love itself cannot keep care and pain loss and sorrow from the most blessed for into each life some rain must fall some days must be dark and sad and dreary she is growing better i am sure of it my dear dont despond but hope and keep happy said mrs march as tenderhearted daisy stooped from her knee to lay her rosy cheek against her little cousins pale one i never ought to while i have you to cheer me up marmee and laurie to take more than half of every burden replied amy warmly he never lets me see his anxiety but is so sweet and patient with me so devoted to beth and such a stay and comfort to me always that i cant love him enough so in spite of my one cross i can say with meg thank god im a happy woman theres no need for me to say it for everyone can see that im far happier than i deserve added
