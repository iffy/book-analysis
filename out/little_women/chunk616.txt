better than i do i think they would came from under the hat in a grim tone quite as touching as a broken one they ought to have told me and not let me go blundering and scolding when i should have been more kind and patient than ever i never did like that miss randal and now i hate her said artful amy wishing to be sure of her facts this time hang miss randal and laurie knocked the hat off his face with a look that left no doubt of his sentiments toward that young lady i beg pardon i thought and there she paused diplomatically no you didnt you knew perfectly well i never cared for anyone but jo laurie said that in his old impetuous tone and turned his face away as he spoke i did think so but as they never said anything about it and you came away i supposed i was mistaken and jo wouldnt be kind to you why i was sure she loved you dearly she was kind but not in the right way and its lucky for her she didnt love me if im the good-for-nothing fellow you think me its her fault though and you may tell her so the hard bitter look came back again as he said that and it troubled amy for she did not know what balm to apply i was wrong i didnt know im very sorry i was so cross but i cant help
