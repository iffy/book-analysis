themselves i owe jo for a part of my education and she believes in peoples paying their honest debts so ill get round her in that way how delightful it is to be able to help others isnt it that was always one of my dreams to have the power of giving freely and thanks to you the dream has come true ah well do quantities of good wont we theres one sort of poverty that i particularly like to help out-and-out beggars get taken care of but poor gentle folks fare badly because they wont ask and people dont dare to offer charity yet there are a thousand ways of helping them if one only knows how to do it so delicately that it does not offend i must say i like to serve a decayed gentleman better than a blarnerying beggar i suppose its wrong but i do though it is harder because it takes a gentleman to do it added the other member of the domestic admiration society thank you im afraid i dont deserve that pretty compliment but i was going to say that while i was dawdling about abroad i saw a good many talented young fellows making all sorts of sacrifices and enduring real hardships that they might realize their dreams splendid fellows some of them working like heros poor and friendless but so full of courage patience and ambition that i was ashamed of myself and longed to give them a right good lift
