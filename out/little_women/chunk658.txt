any objection to make you like it mother said jo as they laid down the closely written sheets and looked at one another yes i hoped it would be so ever since amy wrote that she had refused fred i felt sure then that something better than what you call the mercenary spirit had come over her and a hint here and there in her letters made me suspect that love and laurie would win the day how sharp you are marmee and how silent you never said a word to me mothers have need of sharp eyes and discreet tongues when they have girls to manage i was half afraid to put the idea into your head lest you should write and congratulate them before the thing was settled im not the scatterbrain i was you may trust me im sober and sensible enough for anyones confidante now so you are my dear and i should have made you mine only i fancied it might pain you to learn that your teddy loved someone else now mother did you really think i could be so silly and selfish after id refused his love when it was freshest if not best i knew you were sincere then jo but lately i have thought that if he came back and asked again you might perhaps feel like giving another answer forgive me dear i cant help seeing that you are very lonely and sometimes there is a hungry look in your eyes
