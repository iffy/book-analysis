is a good fellow but not at all the man i fancied you would ever like and lauries face when he uttered them kept returning to her as pertinaciously as her own did when she said in look if not in words i shall marry for money it troubled her to remember that now she wished she could take it back it sounded so unwomanly she didnt want laurie to think her a heartless worldly creature she didnt care to be a queen of society now half so much as she did to be a lovable woman she was so glad he didnt hate her for the dreadful things she said but took them so beautifully and was kinder than ever his letters were such a comfort for the home letters were very irregular and not half so satisfactory as his when they did come it was not only a pleasure but a duty to answer them for the poor fellow was forlorn and needed petting since jo persisted in being stonyhearted she ought to have made an effort and tried to love him it couldnt be very hard many people would be proud and glad to have such a dear boy care for them but jo never would act like other girls so there was nothing to do but be very kind and treat him like a brother if all brothers were treated as well as laurie was at this period they would be a much happier race of beings
