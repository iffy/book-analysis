named for grandpa and teddy a happy-go-lucky baby who seemed to have inherited his papas sunshiny temper as well as his mothers lively spirit how they ever grew up alive in that whirlpool of boys was a mystery to their grandma and aunts but they flourished like dandelions in spring and their rough nurses loved and served them well there were a great many holidays at plumfield and one of the most delightful was the yearly apple-picking for then the marches laurences brookes and bhaers turned out in full force and made a day of it five years after jos wedding one of these fruitful festivals occurred a mellow october day when the air was full of an exhilarating freshness which made the spirits rise and the blood dance healthily in the veins the old orchard wore its holiday attire goldenrod and asters fringed the mossy walls grasshoppers skipped briskly in the sere grass and crickets chirped like fairy pipers at a feast squirrels were busy with their small harvesting birds twittered their adieux from the alders in the lane and every tree stood ready to send down its shower of red or yellow apples at the first shake everybody was there everybody laughed and sang climbed up and tumbled down everybody declared that there never had been such a perfect day or such a jolly set to enjoy it and everyone gave themselves up to the simple pleasures of the hour as freely as if there were no such things
