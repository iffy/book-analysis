that goes to my heart so i fancied that your boy might fill the empty place if he tried now no mother it is better as it is and im glad amy has learned to love him but you are right in one thing i am lonely and perhaps if teddy had tried again i might have said yes not because i love him any more but because i care more to be loved than when he went away im glad of that jo for it shows that you are getting on there are plenty to love you so try to be satisfied with father and mother sisters and brothers friends and babies till the best lover of all comes to give you your reward mothers are the best lovers in the world but i dont mind whispering to marmee that id like to try all kinds its very curious but the more i try to satisfy myself with all sorts of natural affections the more i seem to want id no idea hearts could take in so many mine is so elastic it never seems full now and i used to be quite contented with my family i dont understand it i do and mrs march smiled her wise smile as jo turned back the leaves to read what amy said of laurie it is so beautiful to be loved as laurie loves me he isnt sentimental doesnt say much about it but i see and feel it in all
