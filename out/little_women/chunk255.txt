pome yesterday when i was helping hannah wash and as father likes my silly little things i put it in to amuse him give him my lovingest hug that ever was and kiss yourself a dozen times for your topsy-turvy jo a song from the suds queen of my tub i merrily sing while the white foam rises high and sturdily wash and rinse and wring and fasten the clothes to dry then out in the free fresh air they swing under the sunny sky i wish we could wash from our hearts and souls the stains of the week away and let water and air by their magic make ourselves as pure as they then on the earth there would be indeed a glorious washing day along the path of a useful life will hearts-ease ever bloom the busy mind has no time to think of sorrow or care or gloom and anxious thoughts may be swept away as we bravely wield a broom i am glad a task to me is given to labor at day by day for it brings me health and strength and hope and i cheerfully learn to say head you may think heart you may feel but hand you shall work alway dear mother there is only room for me to send my love and some pressed pansies from the root i have been keeping safe in the house for father to see i read every morning try to be good all day and sing
