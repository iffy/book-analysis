the picturesque scenes that delight beauty-loving eyes here an ancient monastery whence the solemn chanting of the monks came down to them there a bare-legged shepherd in wooden shoes pointed hat and rough jacket over one shoulder sat piping on a stone while his goats skipped among the rocks or lay at his feet meek mouse-colored donkeys laden with panniers of freshly cut grass passed by with a pretty girl in a capaline sitting between the green piles or an old woman spinning with a distaff as she went brown soft-eyed children ran out from the quaint stone hovels to offer nosegays or bunches of oranges still on the bough gnarled olive trees covered the hills with their dusky foliage fruit hung golden in the orchard and great scarlet anemones fringed the roadside while beyond green slopes and craggy heights the maritime alps rose sharp and white against the blue italian sky valrosa well deserved its name for in that climate of perpetual summer roses blossomed everywhere they overhung the archway thrust themselves between the bars of the great gate with a sweet welcome to passers-by and lined the avenue winding through lemon trees and feathery palms up to the villa on the hill every shadowy nook where seats invited one to stop and rest was a mass of bloom every cool grotto had its marble nymph smiling from a veil of flowers and every fountain reflected crimson white or pale pink roses leaning down to smile at their own beauty
