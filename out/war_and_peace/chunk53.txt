to what temptations he will be exposed if i were asked what i desire most on earth it would be to be poorer than the poorest beggar a thousand thanks dear friend for the volume you have sent me and which has such success in moscow yet since you tell me that among some good things it contains others which our weak human understanding cannot grasp it seems to me rather useless to spend time in reading what is unintelligible and can therefore bear no fruit i never could understand the fondness some people have for confusing their minds by dwelling on mystical books that merely awaken their doubts and excite their imagination giving them a bent for exaggeration quite contrary to christian simplicity let us rather read the epistles and gospels let us not seek to penetrate what mysteries they contain for how can we miserable sinners that we are know the terrible and holy secrets of providence while we remain in this flesh which forms an impenetrable veil between us and the eternal let us rather confine ourselves to studying those sublime rules which our divine saviour has left for our guidance here below let us try to conform to them and follow them and let us be persuaded that the less we let our feeble human minds roam the better we shall please god who rejects all knowledge that does not come from him and the less we seek to fathom what he has been pleased to conceal from us the sooner will he vouchsafe its revelation to us through his divine spirit my father has not spoken to me of a suitor but has only told me that he has received a letter and is expecting a visit from prince vasli in regard to this project of marriage for me i will tell you dear sweet friend that i look on marriage as a divine institution to which we must conform however painful it may be to me should the almighty lay the duties of wife and mother upon me i shall try to perform them as faithfully as i can without disquieting myself by examining my feelings toward him whom he may give me for husband i have had a letter from my brother who announces his speedy arrival at bald hills with his wife this pleasure will be but a brief one however for he will leave us again to take part in this unhappy war into which we have been drawn god knows how or why not only where you are at the heart of affairs and of the world is the talk all of war even here amid fieldwork and the calm of nature which townsfolk consider characteristic of the country rumors of war are heard and painfully felt my father talks of nothing but marches and countermarches things of which i understand nothing and the day before yesterday during my daily walk through the village i witnessed a heartrending scene it was a convoy of conscripts enrolled from our people and starting to join the army you should have seen the state of the mothers wives and children of the men who were going and should have heard the sobs it seems as though mankind has forgotten the laws of its divine saviour who preached love and forgiveness of injuries and that men attribute the greatest merit to skill in killing one another adieu dear and kind friend may our divine saviour and his most holy mother keep you in their holy and all-powerful care mary ah you are sending off a letter princess i have already dispatched mine i have written to my poor mother said the smiling mademoiselle bourienne rapidly in her pleasant mellow tones and with guttural rs she brought into princess marys strenuous mournful and gloomy world a quite different atmosphere careless lighthearted and self-satisfied princess i must warn you she added lowering her voice and evidently listening to herself with pleasure and speaking with exaggerated grasseyement the prince has been scolding michael ivnovich he is in a very bad humor very morose be prepared ah dear friend replied princess mary i have asked you never to warn me of the humor my father is in i do not allow myself to judge him and would not have others do so the princess glanced at her watch and seeing that she was five minutes late in starting her practice on the clavichord went into the sitting room with a look of alarm between twelve and two oclock as the day
