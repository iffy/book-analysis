with greater suffering timkhin the red-nosed major of prince andrews regiment had joined him in moscow and was being taken along with him having been wounded in the leg at the battle of borodin they were accompanied by a doctor prince andrews valet his coachman and two orderlies they gave prince andrew some tea he drank it eagerly looking with feverish eyes at the door in front of him as if trying to understand and remember something i dont want any more is timkhin here he asked timkhin crept along the bench to him i am here your excellency hows your wound mine sir all right but how about you prince andrew again pondered as if trying to remember something couldnt one get a book he asked what book the gospels i havent one the doctor promised to procure it for him and began to ask how he was feeling prince andrew answered all his questions reluctantly but reasonably and then said he wanted a bolster placed under him as he was uncomfortable and in great pain the doctor and valet lifted the cloak with which he was covered and making wry faces at the noisome smell of mortifying flesh that came from the wound began examining that dreadful place the doctor was very much displeased about something and made a change in the dressings turning the wounded man over so that he groaned again and grew unconscious and delirious from the agony he kept asking them to get him the book and put it under him what trouble would it be to you he said i have not got one please get it for me and put it under for a moment he pleaded in a piteous voice the doctor went into the passage to wash his hands you fellows have no conscience said he to the valet who was pouring water over his hands for just one moment i didnt look after you its such pain you know that i wonder how he can bear it by the lord jesus christ i thought we had put something under him said the valet the first time prince andrew understood where he was and what was the matter with him and remembered being wounded and how was when he asked to be carried into the hut after his calche had stopped at mytshchi after growing confused from pain while being carried into the hut he again regained consciousness and while drinking tea once more recalled all that had happened to him and above all vividly remembered the moment at the ambulance station when at the sight of the sufferings of a man he disliked those new thoughts had come to him which promised him happiness and those thoughts though now vague and indefinite again possessed his soul he remembered that he had now a new source of happiness and that this happiness had something to do with the gospels that was why he asked for a copy of them the uncomfortable position in which they had put him and turned him over again confused his thoughts and when he came to himself a third time it was in the complete stillness of the night everybody near him was sleeping a cricket chirped from across the passage someone was shouting and singing in the street cockroaches rustled on the table on the icons and on the walls and a big fly flopped at the head of the bed and around the candle beside him the wick of which was charred and had shaped itself like a mushroom his mind was not in a normal state a healthy man usually thinks of feels and remembers innumerable things simultaneously but has the power and will to select one sequence of thoughts or events on which to fix his whole attention a healthy man can tear himself away from the deepest reflections to say a civil word to someone who comes in and can then return again to his own thoughts but prince andrews mind was not in a normal state in that respect all the powers of his mind were more active and clearer than ever but they acted apart from his will most diverse thoughts and images occupied him simultaneously at times his brain suddenly began to work with a vigor clearness and depth it had never reached when he was in health but suddenly in the midst of its work it would turn to some unexpected idea and he had not the strength to turn it back again yes a new happiness was
