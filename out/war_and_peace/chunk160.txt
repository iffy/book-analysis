an officer ah those damned germans they dont know their own country said another what division are you shouted an adjutant riding up the eighteenth then why are you here you should have gone on long ago now you wont get there till evening what stupid orders they dont themselves know what they are doing said the officer and rode off then a general rode past shouting something angrily not in russian tafa-lafa but what hes jabbering no one can make out said a soldier mimicking the general who had ridden away id shoot them the scoundrels we were ordered to be at the place before nine but we havent got halfway fine orders was being repeated on different sides and the feeling of energy with which the troops had started began to turn into vexation and anger at the stupid arrangements and at the germans the cause of the confusion was that while the austrian cavalry was moving toward our left flank the higher command found that our center was too far separated from our right flank and the cavalry were all ordered to turn back to the right several thousand cavalry crossed in front of the infantry who had to wait at the front an altercation occurred between an austrian guide and a russian general the general shouted a demand that the cavalry should be halted the austrian argued that not he but the higher command was to blame the troops meanwhile stood growing listless and dispirited after an hours delay they at last moved on descending the hill the fog that was dispersing on the hill lay still more densely below where they were descending in front in the fog a shot was heard and then another at first irregularly at varying intervals tratatat and then more and more regularly and rapidly and the action at the goldbach stream began not expecting to come on the enemy down by the stream and having stumbled on him in the fog hearing no encouraging word from their commanders and with a consciousness of being too late spreading through the ranks and above all being unable to see anything in front or around them in the thick fog the russians exchanged shots with the enemy lazily and advanced and again halted receiving no timely orders from the officers or adjutants who wandered about in the fog in those unknown surroundings unable to find their own regiments in this way the action began for the first second and third columns which had gone down into the valley the fourth column with which kutzov was stood on the pratzen heights below where the fight was beginning there was still thick fog on the higher ground it was clearing but nothing could be seen of what was going on in front whether all the enemy forces were as we supposed six miles away or whether they were near by in that sea of mist no one knew till after eight oclock it was nine oclock in the morning the fog lay unbroken like a sea down below but higher up at the village of schlappanitz where napoleon stood with his marshals around him it was quite light above him was a clear blue sky and the suns vast orb quivered like a huge hollow crimson float on the surface of that milky sea of mist the whole french army and even napoleon himself with his staff were not on the far side of the streams and hollows of sokolnitz and schlappanitz beyond which we intended to take up our position and begin the action but were on this side so close to our own forces that napoleon with the naked eye could distinguish a mounted man from one on foot napoleon in the blue cloak which he had worn on his italian campaign sat on his small gray arab horse a little in front of his marshals he gazed silently at the hills which seemed to rise out of the sea of mist and on which the russian troops were moving in the distance and he listened to the sounds of firing in the valley not a single muscle of his face which in those days was still thin moved his gleaming eyes were fixed intently on one spot his predictions were being justified part of the russian force had already descended into the valley toward the ponds and lakes and part were leaving these pratzen heights which he intended to attack and regarded as the key to the position he saw over the mist
