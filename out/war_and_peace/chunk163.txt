on the field of olmtz where bolknski had seen him for the first time abroad but there was still the same bewitching combination of majesty and mildness in his fine gray eyes and on his delicate lips the same capacity for varying expression and the same prevalent appearance of goodhearted innocent youth at the olmtz review he had seemed more majestic here he seemed brighter and more energetic he was slightly flushed after galloping two miles and reining in his horse he sighed restfully and looked round at the faces of his suite young and animated as his own czartorski novosltsev prince volknsky strgonov and the others all richly dressed gay young men on splendid well-groomed fresh only slightly heated horses exchanging remarks and smiling had stopped behind the emperor the emperor francis a rosy long faced young man sat very erect on his handsome black horse looking about him in a leisurely and preoccupied manner he beckoned to one of his white adjutants and asked some question most likely he is asking at what oclock they started thought prince andrew watching his old acquaintance with a smile he could not repress as he recalled his reception at brnn in the emperors suite were the picked young orderly officers of the guard and line regiments russian and austrian among them were grooms leading the tsars beautiful relay horses covered with embroidered cloths as when a window is opened a whiff of fresh air from the fields enters a stuffy room so a whiff of youthfulness energy and confidence of success reached kutzovs cheerless staff with the galloping advent of all these brilliant young men why arent you beginning michael ilarinovich said the emperor alexander hurriedly to kutzov glancing courteously at the same time at the emperor francis i am waiting your majesty answered kutzov bending forward respectfully the emperor frowning slightly bent his ear forward as if he had not quite heard waiting your majesty repeated kutzov prince andrew noted that kutzovs upper lip twitched unnaturally as he said the word waiting not all the columns have formed up yet your majesty the tsar heard but obviously did not like the reply he shrugged his rather round shoulders and glanced at novosltsev who was near him as if complaining of kutzov you know michael ilarinovich we are not on the empress field where a parade does not begin till all the troops are assembled said the tsar with another glance at the emperor francis as if inviting him if not to join in at least to listen to what he was saying but the emperor francis continued to look about him and did not listen that is just why i do not begin sire said kutzov in a resounding voice apparently to preclude the possibility of not being heard and again something in his face twitched that is just why i do not begin sire because we are not on parade and not on the empress field said he clearly and distinctly in the emperors suite all exchanged rapid looks that expressed dissatisfaction and reproach old though he may be he should not he certainly should not speak like that their glances seemed to say the tsar looked intently and observantly into kutzovs eye waiting to hear whether he would say anything more but kutzov with respectfully bowed head seemed also to be waiting the silence lasted for about a minute however if you command it your majesty said kutzov lifting his head and again assuming his former tone of a dull unreasoning but submissive general he touched his horse and having called milordovich the commander of the column gave him the order to advance the troops again began to move and two battalions of the nvgorod and one of the psheron regiment went forward past the emperor as this psheron battalion marched by the red-faced milordovich without his greatcoat with his orders on his breast and an enormous tuft of plumes in his cocked hat worn on one side with its corners front and back galloped strenuously forward and with a dashing salute reined in his horse before the emperor god be with you general said the emperor ma foi sire nous ferons ce qui sera dans notre possibilit sire he answered gaily raising nevertheless ironic smiles among the gentlemen of the tsars suite by his poor french indeed sire we shall do everything it is possible to do sire milordovich wheeled his horse sharply and stationed himself a little behind the emperor the psheron men excited by the tsars presence
