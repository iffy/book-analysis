amiably an argument which was embarrassing for his companion if you will do me the honor of calling on me on wednesday he added i will after talking with magntski let you know what may interest you and shall also have the pleasure of a more detailed chat with you closing his eyes he bowed la franaise without taking leave and trying to attract as little attention as possible he left the room chapter vi during the first weeks of his stay in petersburg prince andrew felt the whole trend of thought he had formed during his life of seclusion quite overshadowed by the trifling cares that engrossed him in that city on returning home in the evening he would jot down in his notebook four or five necessary calls or appointments for certain hours the mechanism of life the arrangement of the day so as to be in time everywhere absorbed the greater part of his vital energy he did nothing did not even think or find time to think but only talked and talked successfully of what he had thought while in the country he sometimes noticed with dissatisfaction that he repeated the same remark on the same day in different circles but he was so busy for whole days together that he had no time to notice that he was thinking of nothing as he had done on their first meeting at kochubys spernski produced a strong impression on prince andrew on the wednesday when he received him tte--tte at his own house and talked to him long and confidentially to bolknski so many people appeared contemptible and insignificant creatures and he so longed to find in someone the living ideal of that perfection toward which he strove that he readily believed that in spernski he had found this ideal of a perfectly rational and virtuous man had spernski sprung from the same class as himself and possessed the same breeding and traditions bolknski would soon have discovered his weak human unheroic sides but as it was spernskis strange and logical turn of mind inspired him with respect all the more because he did not quite understand him moreover spernski either because he appreciated the others capacity or because he considered it necessary to win him to his side showed off his dispassionate calm reasonableness before prince andrew and flattered him with that subtle flattery which goes hand in hand with self-assurance and consists in a tacit assumption that ones companion is the only man besides oneself capable of understanding the folly of the rest of mankind and the reasonableness and profundity of ones own ideas during their long conversation on wednesday evening spernski more than once remarked we regard everything that is above the common level of rooted custom or with a smile but we want the wolves to be fed and the sheep to be safe or they cannot understand this and all in a way that seemed to say we you and i understand what they are and who we are this first long conversation with spernski only strengthened in prince andrew the feeling he had experienced toward him at their first meeting he saw in him a remarkable clear-thinking man of vast intellect who by his energy and persistence had attained power which he was using solely for the welfare of russia in prince andrews eyes spernski was the man he would himself have wished to be one who explained all the facts of life reasonably considered important only what was rational and was capable of applying the standard of reason to everything everything seemed so simple and clear in spernskis exposition that prince andrew involuntarily agreed with him about everything if he replied and argued it was only because he wished to maintain his independence and not submit to spernskis opinions entirely everything was right and everything was as it should be only one thing disconcerted prince andrew this was spernskis cold mirrorlike look which did not allow one to penetrate to his soul and his delicate white hands which prince andrew involuntarily watched as one does watch the hands of those who possess power this mirrorlike gaze and those delicate hands irritated prince andrew he knew not why he was unpleasantly struck too by the excessive contempt for others that he observed in spernski and by the diversity of lines of argument he used to support his opinions he made use of every kind of mental device except analogy and passed too boldly it seemed to prince andrew from one to another now
