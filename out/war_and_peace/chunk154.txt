staff finished reading then milordovich looked round significantly at the other generals but one could not tell from that significant look whether he agreed or disagreed and was satisfied or not with the arrangements next to weyrother sat count langeron who with a subtle smile that never left his typically southern french face during the whole time of the reading gazed at his delicate fingers which rapidly twirled by its corners a gold snuffbox on which was a portrait in the middle of one of the longest sentences he stopped the rotary motion of the snuffbox raised his head and with inimical politeness lurking in the corners of his thin lips interrupted weyrother wishing to say something but the austrian general continuing to read frowned angrily and jerked his elbows as if to say you can tell me your views later but now be so good as to look at the map and listen langeron lifted his eyes with an expression of perplexity turned round to milordovich as if seeking an explanation but meeting the latters impressive but meaningless gaze drooped his eyes sadly and again took to twirling his snuffbox a geography lesson he muttered as if to himself but loud enough to be heard przebyszwski with respectful but dignified politeness held his hand to his ear toward weyrother with the air of a man absorbed in attention dohktrov a little man sat opposite weyrother with an assiduous and modest mien and stooping over the outspread map conscientiously studied the dispositions and the unfamiliar locality he asked weyrother several times to repeat words he had not clearly heard and the difficult names of villages weyrother complied and dohktrov noted them down when the reading which lasted more than an hour was over langeron again brought his snuffbox to rest and without looking at weyrother or at anyone in particular began to say how difficult it was to carry out such a plan in which the enemys position was assumed to be known whereas it was perhaps not known since the enemy was in movement langerons objections were valid but it was obvious that their chief aim was to show general weyrother who had read his dispositions with as much self-confidence as if he were addressing school children that he had to do not with fools but with men who could teach him something in military matters when the monotonous sound of weyrothers voice ceased kutzov opened his eye as a miller wakes up when the soporific drone of the mill wheel is interrupted he listened to what langeron said as if remarking so you are still at that silly business quickly closed his eye again and let his head sink still lower langeron trying as virulently as possible to sting weyrothers vanity as author of the military plan argued that bonaparte might easily attack instead of being attacked and so render the whole of this plan perfectly worthless weyrother met all objections with a firm and contemptuous smile evidently prepared beforehand to meet all objections be they what they might if he could attack us he would have done so today said he so you think he is powerless said langeron he has forty thousand men at most replied weyrother with the smile of a doctor to whom an old wife wishes to explain the treatment of a case in that case he is inviting his doom by awaiting our attack said langeron with a subtly ironical smile again glancing round for support to milordovich who was near him but milordovich was at that moment evidently thinking of anything rather than of what the generals were disputing about ma foi said he tomorrow we shall see all that on the battlefield weyrother again gave that smile which seemed to say that to him it was strange and ridiculous to meet objections from russian generals and to have to prove to them what he had not merely convinced himself of but had also convinced the sovereign emperors of the enemy has quenched his fires and a continual noise is heard from his camp said he what does that mean either he is retreating which is the only thing we need fear or he is changing his position he smiled ironically but even if he also took up a position in the thuerassa he merely saves us a great deal of trouble and all our arrangements to the minutest detail remain the same how is that began prince andrew who had for long been waiting an opportunity to express his doubts kutzov here
