attained by the guerrilla warfare which was destroying the french and thirdly by the fact that a large russian army was following the french ready to use its strength in case their movement stopped the russian army had to act like a whip to a running animal and the experienced driver knew it was better to hold the whip raised as a menace than to strike the running animal on the head book fifteen chapter i when seeing a dying animal a man feels a sense of horror substance similar to his own is perishing before his eyes but when it is a beloved and intimate human being that is dying besides this horror at the extinction of life there is a severance a spiritual wound which like a physical wound is sometimes fatal and sometimes heals but always aches and shrinks at any external irritating touch after prince andrews death natsha and princess mary alike felt this drooping in spirit and closing their eyes before the menacing cloud of death that overhung them they dared not look life in the face they carefully guarded their open wounds from any rough and painful contact everything a carriage passing rapidly in the street a summons to dinner the maids inquiry what dress to prepare or worse still any word of insincere or feeble sympathy seemed an insult painfully irritated the wound interrupting that necessary quiet in which they both tried to listen to the stern and dreadful choir that still resounded in their imagination and hindered their gazing into those mysterious limitless vistas that for an instant had opened out before them only when alone together were they free from such outrage and pain they spoke little even to one another and when they did it was of very unimportant matters both avoided any allusion to the future to admit the possibility of a future seemed to them to insult his memory still more carefully did they avoid anything relating to him who was dead it seemed to them that what they had lived through and experienced could not be expressed in words and that any reference to the details of his life infringed the majesty and sacredness of the mystery that had been accomplished before their eyes continued abstention from speech and constant avoidance of everything that might lead up to the subject this halting on all sides at the boundary of what they might not mention brought before their minds with still greater purity and clearness what they were both feeling but pure and complete sorrow is as impossible as pure and complete joy princess mary in her position as absolute and independent arbiter of her own fate and guardian and instructor of her nephew was the first to be called back to life from that realm of sorrow in which she had dwelt for the first fortnight she received letters from her relations to which she had to reply the room in which little nicholas had been put was damp and he began to cough alptych came to yaroslvl with reports on the state of their affairs and with advice and suggestions that they should return to moscow to the house on the vozdvzhenka street which had remained uninjured and needed only slight repairs life did not stand still and it was necessary to live hard as it was for princess mary to emerge from the realm of secluded contemplation in which she had lived till then and sorry and almost ashamed as she felt to leave natsha alone yet the cares of life demanded her attention and she involuntarily yielded to them she went through the accounts with alptych conferred with dessalles about her nephew and gave orders and made preparations for the journey to moscow natsha remained alone and from the time princess mary began making preparations for departure held aloof from her too princess mary asked the countess to let natsha go with her to moscow and both parents gladly accepted this offer for they saw their daughter losing strength every day and thought that a change of scene and the advice of moscow doctors would be good for her i am not going anywhere natsha replied when this was proposed to her do please just leave me alone and she ran out of the room with difficulty refraining from tears of vexation and irritation rather than of sorrow after she felt herself deserted by princes mary and alone in her grief natsha spent most of the time in her room by herself sitting huddled up feet
