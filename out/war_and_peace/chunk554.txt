captain looking with glistening eyes at pierre began talking of love and of his love affairs there were very many of these as one could easily believe looking at the officers handsome self-satisfied face and noting the eager enthusiasm with which he spoke of women though all ramballes love stories had the sensual character which frenchmen regard as the special charm and poetry of love yet he told his story with such sincere conviction that he alone had experienced and known all the charm of love and he described women so alluringly that pierre listened to him with curiosity it was plain that lamour which the frenchman was so fond of was not that low and simple kind that pierre had once felt for his wife nor was it the romantic love stimulated by himself that he experienced for natsha ramballe despised both these kinds of love equally the one he considered the love of clodhoppers and the other the love of simpletons lamour which the frenchman worshiped consisted principally in the unnaturalness of his relation to the woman and in a combination of incongruities giving the chief charm to the feeling thus the captain touchingly recounted the story of his love for a fascinating marquise of thirty-five and at the same time for a charming innocent child of seventeen daughter of the bewitching marquise the conflict of magnanimity between the mother and the daughter ending in the mothers sacrificing herself and offering her daughter in marriage to her lover even now agitated the captain though it was the memory of a distant past then he recounted an episode in which the husband played the part of the lover and he the lover assumed the role of the husband as well as several droll incidents from his recollections of germany where shelter is called unterkunft and where the husbands eat sauerkraut and the young girls are too blonde finally the latest episode in poland still fresh in the captains memory and which he narrated with rapid gestures and glowing face was of how he had saved the life of a pole in general the saving of life continually occurred in the captains stories and the pole had entrusted to him his enchanting wife parisienne de cur while himself entering the french service the captain was happy the enchanting polish lady wished to elope with him but prompted by magnanimity the captain restored the wife to the husband saying as he did so i have saved your life and i save your honor having repeated these words the captain wiped his eyes and gave himself a shake as if driving away the weakness which assailed him at this touching recollection listening to the captains tales pierre as often happens late in the evening and under the influence of wine followed all that was told him understood it all and at the same time followed a train of personal memories which he knew not why suddenly arose in his mind while listening to these love stories his own love for natsha unexpectedly rose to his mind and going over the pictures of that love in his imagination he mentally compared them with ramballes tales listening to the story of the struggle between love and duty pierre saw before his eyes every minutest detail of his last meeting with the object of his love at the skharev water tower at the time of that meeting it had not produced an effect upon him he had not even once recalled it but now it seemed to him that that meeting had had in it something very important and poetic peter kirlovich come here we have recognized you he now seemed to hear the words she had uttered and to see before him her eyes her smile her traveling hood and a stray lock of her hair and there seemed to him something pathetic and touching in all this having finished his tale about the enchanting polish lady the captain asked pierre if he had ever experienced a similar impulse to sacrifice himself for love and a feeling of envy of the legitimate husband challenged by this question pierre raised his head and felt a need to express the thoughts that filled his mind he began to explain that he understood love for a woman somewhat differently he said that in all his life he had loved and still loved only one woman and that she could never be his tiens said the captain pierre then explained that he had loved this woman from his earliest years
