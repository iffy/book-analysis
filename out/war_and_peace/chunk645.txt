with karatev the day before at their yesterdays halting place feeling chilly by a dying campfire pierre had got up and gone to the next one which was burning better there platn karatev was sitting covered up head and all with his greatcoat as if it were a vestment telling the soldiers in his effective and pleasant though now feeble voice a story pierre knew it was already past midnight the hour when karatev was usually free of his fever and particularly lively when pierre reached the fire and heard platns voice enfeebled by illness and saw his pathetic face brightly lit up by the blaze he felt a painful prick at his heart his feeling of pity for this man frightened him and he wished to go away but there was no other fire and pierre sat down trying not to look at platn well how are you he asked how am i if we grumble at sickness god wont grant us death replied platn and at once resumed the story he had begun and so brother he continued with a smile on his pale emaciated face and a particularly happy light in his eyes you see brother pierre had long been familiar with that story karatev had told it to him alone some half-dozen times and always with a specially joyful emotion but well as he knew it pierre now listened to that tale as to something new and the quiet rapture karatev evidently felt as he told it communicated itself also to pierre the story was of an old merchant who lived a good and god-fearing life with his family and who went once to the nzhni fair with a companion a rich merchant having put up at an inn they both went to sleep and next morning his companion was found robbed and with his throat cut a bloodstained knife was found under the old merchants pillow he was tried knouted and his nostrils having been torn off all in due form as karatev put it he was sent to hard labor in siberia and so brother it was at this point that pierre came up ten years or more passed by the old man was living as a convict submitting as he should and doing no wrong only he prayed to god for death well one night the convicts were gathered just as we are with the old man among them and they began telling what each was suffering for and how they had sinned against god one told how he had taken a life another had taken two a third had set a house on fire while another had simply been a vagrant and had done nothing so they asked the old man what are you being punished for daddy i my dear brothers said he am being punished for my own and other mens sins but i have not killed anyone or taken anything that was not mine but have only helped my poorer brothers i was a merchant my dear brothers and had much property and he went on to tell them all about it in due order i dont grieve for myself he says god it seems has chastened me only i am sorry for my old wife and the children and the old man began to weep now it happened that in the group was the very man who had killed the other merchant where did it happen daddy he said when and in what month he asked all about it and his heart began to ache so he comes up to the old man like this and falls down at his feet you are perishing because of me daddy he says its quite true lads that this man he says is being tortured innocently and for nothing i he says did that deed and i put the knife under your head while you were asleep forgive me daddy he says for christs sake karatev paused smiling joyously as he gazed into the fire and he drew the logs together and the old man said god will forgive you we are all sinners in his sight i suffer for my own sins and he wept bitter tears well and what do you think dear friends karatev continued his face brightening more and more with a rapturous smile as if what he now had to tell contained the chief charm and the whole meaning of his story what do you think dear fellows that murderer confessed to the authorities i have taken six
