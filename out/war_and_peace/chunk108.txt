lay between them all were conscious of this unseen line and the question whether they would cross it or not and how they would cross it agitated them all the colonel rode to the front angrily gave some reply to questions put to him by the officers and like a man desperately insisting on having his own way gave an order no one said anything definite but the rumor of an attack spread through the squadron the command to form up rang out and the sabers whizzed as they were drawn from their scabbards still no one moved the troops of the left flank infantry and hussars alike felt that the commander did not himself know what to do and this irresolution communicated itself to the men if only they would be quick thought rostv feeling that at last the time had come to experience the joy of an attack of which he had so often heard from his fellow hussars foward with god lads rang out densovs voice at a twot foward the horses croups began to sway in the front line rook pulled at the reins and started of his own accord before him on the right rostv saw the front lines of his hussars and still farther ahead a dark line which he could not see distinctly but took to be the enemy shots could be heard but some way off faster came the word of command and rostv felt rooks flanks drooping as he broke into a gallop rostv anticipated his horses movements and became more and more elated he had noticed a solitary tree ahead of him this tree had been in the middle of the line that had seemed so terrible and now he had crossed that line and not only was there nothing terrible but everything was becoming more and more happy and animated oh how i will slash at him thought rostv gripping the hilt of his saber hur-a-a-a-ah came a roar of voices let anyone come my way now thought rostv driving his spurs into rook and letting him go at a full gallop so that he outstripped the others ahead the enemy was already visible suddenly something like a birch broom seemed to sweep over the squadron rostv raised his saber ready to strike but at that instant the trooper niktenko who was galloping ahead shot away from him and rostv felt as in a dream that he continued to be carried forward with unnatural speed but yet stayed on the same spot from behind him bondarchk an hussar he knew jolted against him and looked angrily at him bondarchks horse swerved and galloped past how is it i am not moving i have fallen i am killed rostv asked and answered at the same instant he was alone in the middle of a field instead of the moving horses and hussars backs he saw nothing before him but the motionless earth and the stubble around him there was warm blood under his arm no i am wounded and the horse is killed rook tried to rise on his forelegs but fell back pinning his riders leg blood was flowing from his head he struggled but could not rise rostv also tried to rise but fell back his sabretache having become entangled in the saddle where our men were and where the french he did not know there was no one near having disentangled his leg he rose where on which side was now the line that had so sharply divided the two armies he asked himself and could not answer can something bad have happened to me he wondered as he got up and at that moment he felt that something superfluous was hanging on his benumbed left arm the wrist felt as if it were not his he examined his hand carefully vainly trying to find blood on it ah here are people coming he thought joyfully seeing some men running toward him they will help me in front came a man wearing a strange shako and a blue cloak swarthy sunburned and with a hooked nose then came two more and many more running behind one of them said something strange not in russian in among the hindmost of these men wearing similar shakos was a russian hussar he was being held by the arms and his horse was being led behind him it must be one of ours a prisoner yes can it be that they will take me too who are these men thought rostv scarcely believing
