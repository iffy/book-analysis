hole in it with its pole several soldiers ran toward the cart from different sides some beat the carriage horses on their heads turning them aside others fought among themselves and pierre saw that one german was badly wounded on the head by a sword it seemed that all these men now that they had stopped amid fields in the chill dusk of the autumn evening experienced one and the same feeling of unpleasant awakening from the hurry and eagerness to push on that had seized them at the start once at a standstill they all seemed to understand that they did not yet know where they were going and that much that was painful and difficult awaited them on this journey during this halt the escort treated the prisoners even worse than they had done at the start it was here that the prisoners for the first time received horseflesh for their meat ration from the officer down to the lowest soldier they showed what seemed like personal spite against each of the prisoners in unexpected contrast to their former friendly relations this spite increased still more when on calling over the roll of prisoners it was found that in the bustle of leaving moscow one russian soldier who had pretended to suffer from colic had escaped pierre saw a frenchman beat a russian soldier cruelly for straying too far from the road and heard his friend the captain reprimand and threaten to court-martial a noncommissioned officer on account of the escape of the russian to the noncommissioned officers excuse that the prisoner was ill and could not walk the officer replied that the order was to shoot those who lagged behind pierre felt that that fatal force which had crushed him during the executions but which he had not felt during his imprisonment now again controlled his existence it was terrible but he felt that in proportion to the efforts of that fatal force to crush him there grew and strengthened in his soul a power of life independent of it he ate his supper of buckwheat soup with horseflesh and chatted with his comrades neither pierre nor any of the others spoke of what they had seen in moscow or of the roughness of their treatment by the french or of the order to shoot them which had been announced to them as if in reaction against the worsening of their position they were all particularly animated and gay they spoke of personal reminiscences of amusing scenes they had witnessed during the campaign and avoided all talk of their present situation the sun had set long since bright stars shone out here and there in the sky a red glow as of a conflagration spread above the horizon from the rising full moon and that vast red ball swayed strangely in the gray haze it grew light the evening was ending but the night had not yet come pierre got up and left his new companions crossing between the campfires to the other side of the road where he had been told the common soldier prisoners were stationed he wanted to talk to them on the road he was stopped by a french sentinel who ordered him back pierre turned back not to his companions by the campfire but to an unharnessed cart where there was nobody tucking his legs under him and dropping his head he sat down on the cold ground by the wheel of the cart and remained motionless a long while sunk in thought suddenly he burst out into a fit of his broad good-natured laughter so loud that men from various sides turned with surprise to see what this strange and evidently solitary laughter could mean ha-ha-ha laughed pierre and he said aloud to himself the soldier did not let me pass they took me and shut me up they hold me captive what me me my immortal soul ha-ha-ha ha-ha-ha and he laughed till tears started to his eyes a man got up and came to see what this queer big fellow was laughing at all by himself pierre stopped laughing got up went farther away from the inquisitive man and looked around him the huge endless bivouac that had previously resounded with the crackling of campfires and the voices of many men had grown quiet the red campfires were growing paler and dying down high up in the light sky hung the full moon forests and fields beyond the camp unseen before were now visible in the distance and farther still beyond
