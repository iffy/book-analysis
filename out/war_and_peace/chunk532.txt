shouts drawn on by the movement of his troops napoleon rode with them as far as the dorogomlov gate but there again stopped and dismounting from his horse paced for a long time by the kmmer-kollzski rampart awaiting the deputation chapter xx meanwhile moscow was empty there were still people in it perhaps a fiftieth part of its former inhabitants had remained but it was empty it was empty in the sense that a dying queenless hive is empty in a queenless hive no life is left though to a superficial glance it seems as much alive as other hives the bees circle round a queenless hive in the hot beams of the midday sun as gaily as around the living hives from a distance it smells of honey like the others and bees fly in and out in the same way but one has only to observe that hive to realize that there is no longer any life in it the bees do not fly in the same way the smell and the sound that meet the beekeeper are not the same to the beekeepers tap on the wall of the sick hive instead of the former instant unanimous humming of tens of thousands of bees with their abdomens threateningly compressed and producing by the rapid vibration of their wings an aerial living sound the only reply is a disconnected buzzing from different parts of the deserted hive from the alighting board instead of the former spirituous fragrant smell of honey and venom and the warm whiffs of crowded life comes an odor of emptiness and decay mingling with the smell of honey there are no longer sentinels sounding the alarm with their abdomens raised and ready to die in defense of the hive there is no longer the measured quiet sound of throbbing activity like the sound of boiling water but diverse discordant sounds of disorder in and out of the hive long black robber bees smeared with honey fly timidly and shiftily they do not sting but crawl away from danger formerly only bees laden with honey flew into the hive and they flew out empty now they fly out laden the beekeeper opens the lower part of the hive and peers in instead of black glossy bees tamed by toil clinging to one anothers legs and drawing out the wax with a ceaseless hum of labor that used to hang in long clusters down to the floor of the hive drowsy shriveled bees crawl about separately in various directions on the floor and walls of the hive instead of a neatly glued floor swept by the bees with the fanning of their wings there is a floor littered with bits of wax excrement dying bees scarcely moving their legs and dead ones that have not been cleared away the beekeeper opens the upper part of the hive and examines the super instead of serried rows of bees sealing up every gap in the combs and keeping the brood warm he sees the skillful complex structures of the combs but no longer in their former state of purity all is neglected and foul black robber bees are swiftly and stealthily prowling about the combs and the short home bees shriveled and listless as if they were old creep slowly about without trying to hinder the robbers having lost all motive and all sense of life drones bumblebees wasps and butterflies knock awkwardly against the walls of the hive in their flight here and there among the cells containing dead brood and honey an angry buzzing can sometimes be heard here and there a couple of bees by force of habit and custom cleaning out the brood cells with efforts beyond their strength laboriously drag away a dead bee or bumblebee without knowing why they do it in another corner two old bees are languidly fighting or cleaning themselves or feeding one another without themselves knowing whether they do it with friendly or hostile intent in a third place a crowd of bees crushing one another attack some victim and fight and smother it and the victim enfeebled or killed drops from above slowly and lightly as a feather among the heap of corpses the keeper opens the two center partitions to examine the brood cells in place of the former close dark circles formed by thousands of bees sitting back to back and guarding the high mystery of generation he sees hundreds of dull listless and sleepy shells of bees they have almost all died unawares sitting in the
