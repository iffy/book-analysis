back past it carrying their wounded on their muskets a general with his suite came to the battery and after speaking to the colonel gave pierre an angry look and went away again having ordered the infantry supports behind the battery to lie down so as to be less exposed to fire after this from amid the ranks of infantry to the right of the battery came the sound of a drum and shouts of command and from the battery one saw how those ranks of infantry moved forward pierre looked over the wall of the trench and was particularly struck by a pale young officer who letting his sword hang down was walking backwards and kept glancing uneasily around the ranks of the infantry disappeared amid the smoke but their long-drawn shout and rapid musketry firing could still be heard a few minutes later crowds of wounded men and stretcher-bearers came back from that direction projectiles began to fall still more frequently in the battery several men were lying about who had not been removed around the cannon the men moved still more briskly and busily no one any longer took notice of pierre once or twice he was shouted at for being in the way the senior officer moved with big rapid strides from one gun to another with a frowning face the young officer with his face still more flushed commanded the men more scrupulously than ever the soldiers handed up the charges turned loaded and did their business with strained smartness they gave little jumps as they walked as though they were on springs the stormcloud had come upon them and in every face the fire which pierre had watched kindle burned up brightly pierre standing beside the commanding officer the young officer his hand to his shako ran up to his superior i have the honor to report sir that only eight rounds are left are we to continue firing he asked grapeshot the senior shouted without answering the question looking over the wall of the trench suddenly something happened the young officer gave a gasp and bending double sat down on the ground like a bird shot on the wing everything became strange confused and misty in pierres eyes one cannon ball after another whistled by and struck the earthwork a soldier or a gun pierre who had not noticed these sounds before now heard nothing else on the right of the battery soldiers shouting hurrah were running not forwards but backwards it seemed to pierre a cannon ball struck the very end of the earth work by which he was standing crumbling down the earth a black ball flashed before his eyes and at the same instant plumped into something some militiamen who were entering the battery ran back all with grapeshot shouted the officer the sergeant ran up to the officer and in a frightened whisper informed him as a butler at dinner informs his master that there is no more of some wine asked for that there were no more charges the scoundrels what are they doing shouted the officer turning to pierre the officers face was red and perspiring and his eyes glittered under his frowning brow run to the reserves and bring up the ammunition boxes he yelled angrily avoiding pierre with his eyes and speaking to his men ill go said pierre the officer without answering him strode across to the opposite side dont fire wait he shouted the man who had been ordered to go for ammunition stumbled against pierre eh sir this is no place for you said he and ran down the slope pierre ran after him avoiding the spot where the young officer was sitting one cannon ball another and a third flew over him falling in front beside and behind him pierre ran down the slope where am i going he suddenly asked himself when he was already near the green ammunition wagons he halted irresolutely not knowing whether to return or go on suddenly a terrible concussion threw him backwards to the ground at the same instant he was dazzled by a great flash of flame and immediately a deafening roar crackling and whistling made his ears tingle when he came to himself he was sitting on the ground leaning on his hands the ammunition wagons he had been approaching no longer existed only charred green boards and rags littered the scorched grass and a horse dangling fragments of its shaft behind it galloped past while another horse lay like pierre on the ground
