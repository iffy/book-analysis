morning after the storm drops still continued to fall but vertically now and all was still the whole sun appeared on the horizon and disappeared behind a long narrow cloud that hung above it a few minutes later it reappeared brighter still from behind the top of the cloud tearing its edge everything grew bright and glittered and with that light and as if in reply to it came the sound of guns ahead of them before rostv had had time to consider and determine the distance of that firing count ostermann-tolstys adjutant came galloping from vtebsk with orders to advance at a trot along the road the squadron overtook and passed the infantry and the battery which had also quickened their pace rode down a hill and passing through an empty and deserted village again ascended the horses began to lather and the men to flush halt dress your ranks the order of the regimental commander was heard ahead forward by the left walk march came the order from in front and the hussars passing along the line of troops on the left flank of our position halted behind our uhlans who were in the front line to the right stood our infantry in a dense column they were the reserve higher up the hill on the very horizon our guns were visible through the wonderfully clear air brightly illuminated by slanting morning sunbeams in front beyond a hollow dale could be seen the enemys columns and guns our advanced line already in action could be heard briskly exchanging shots with the enemy in the dale at these sounds long unheard rostvs spirits rose as at the strains of the merriest music trap-ta-ta-tap cracked the shots now together now several quickly one after another again all was silent and then again it sounded as if someone were walking on detonators and exploding them the hussars remained in the same place for about an hour a cannonade began count ostermann with his suite rode up behind the squadron halted spoke to the commander of the regiment and rode up the hill to the guns after ostermann had gone a command rang out to the uhlans form column prepare to charge the infantry in front of them parted into platoons to allow the cavalry to pass the uhlans started the streamers on their spears fluttering and trotted downhill toward the french cavalry which was seen below to the left as soon as the uhlans descended the hill the hussars were ordered up the hill to support the battery as they took the places vacated by the uhlans bullets came from the front whining and whistling but fell spent without taking effect the sounds which he had not heard for so long had an even more pleasurable and exhilarating effect on rostv than the previous sounds of firing drawing himself up he viewed the field of battle opening out before him from the hill and with his whole soul followed the movement of the uhlans they swooped down close to the french dragoons something confused happened there amid the smoke and five minutes later our uhlans were galloping back not to the place they had occupied but more to the left and among the orange-colored uhlans on chestnut horses and behind them in a large group blue french dragoons on gray horses could be seen chapter xv rostv with his keen sportsmans eye was one of the first to catch sight of these blue french dragoons pursuing our uhlans nearer and nearer in disorderly crowds came the uhlans and the french dragoons pursuing them he could already see how these men who looked so small at the foot of the hill jostled and overtook one another waving their arms and their sabers in the air rostv gazed at what was happening before him as at a hunt he felt instinctively that if the hussars struck at the french dragoons now the latter could not withstand them but if a charge was to be made it must be done now at that very moment or it would be too late he looked around a captain standing beside him was gazing like himself with eyes fixed on the cavalry below them andrew sevastynych said rostv you know we could crush them a fine thing too replied the captain and really rostv without waiting to hear him out touched his horse galloped to the front of his squadron and before he had time to finish giving the word of command the whole squadron sharing his feeling was
