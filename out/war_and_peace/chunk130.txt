at annettes receptions where you always ran away you remember cette chre annette anna pvlovna ah but you wont talk politics to me like annette and our little tea table oh yes why is it you were never at annettes the little princess asked anatole ah i know i know she said with a sly glance your brother hippolyte told me about your goings on oh and she shook her finger at him i have even heard of your doings in paris and didnt hippolyte tell you asked prince vasli turning to his son and seizing the little princess arm as if she would have run away and he had just managed to catch her didnt he tell you how he himself was pining for the dear princess and how she showed him the door oh she is a pearl among women princess he added turning to princess mary when paris was mentioned mademoiselle bourienne for her part seized the opportunity of joining in the general current of recollections she took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since anatole had left paris and how he had liked that city anatole answered the frenchwoman very readily and looking at her with a smile talked to her about her native land when he saw the pretty little bourienne anatole came to the conclusion that he would not find bald hills dull either not at all bad he thought examining her not at all bad that little companion i hope she will bring her along with her when were married la petite est gentille the little one is charming the old prince dressed leisurely in his study frowning and considering what he was to do the coming of these visitors annoyed him what are prince vasli and that son of his to me prince vasli is a shallow braggart and his son no doubt is a fine specimen he grumbled to himself what angered him was that the coming of these visitors revived in his mind an unsettled question he always tried to stifle one about which he always deceived himself the question was whether he could ever bring himself to part from his daughter and give her to a husband the prince never directly asked himself that question knowing beforehand that he would have to answer it justly and justice clashed not only with his feelings but with the very possibility of life life without princess mary little as he seemed to value her was unthinkable to him and why should she marry he thought to be unhappy for certain theres lise married to andrew a better husband one would think could hardly be found nowadays but is she contented with her lot and who would marry marie for love plain and awkward theyll take her for her connections and wealth are there no women living unmarried and even the happier for it so thought prince bolknski while dressing and yet the question he was always putting off demanded an immediate answer prince vasli had brought his son with the evident intention of proposing and today or tomorrow he would probably ask for an answer his birth and position in society were not bad well ive nothing against it the prince said to himself but he must be worthy of her and that is what we shall see that is what we shall see that is what we shall see he added aloud he entered the drawing room with his usual alert step glancing rapidly round the company he noticed the change in the little princess dress mademoiselle bouriennes ribbon princess marys unbecoming coiffure mademoiselle bouriennes and anatoles smiles and the loneliness of his daughter amid the general conversation got herself up like a fool he thought looking irritably at her she is shameless and he ignores her he went straight up to prince vasli well how dye do how dye do glad to see you friendship laughs at distance began prince vasli in his usual rapid self-confident familiar tone here is my second son please love and befriend him prince bolknski surveyed anatole fine young fellow fine young fellow he said well come and kiss me and he offered his cheek anatole kissed the old man and looked at him with curiosity and perfect composure waiting for a display of the eccentricities his father had told him to expect prince bolknski sat down in his usual place in the corner of the sofa and drawing up an armchair for prince vasli pointed to it and began questioning him about political affairs
