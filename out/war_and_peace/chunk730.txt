occurs be it what it may then out of all the continually expressed wishes of different people some will always be found which by their meaning and their time of utterance are related as commands to the events arriving at this conclusion we can reply directly and positively to these two essential questions of history what is power what force produces the movement of the nations power is the relation of a given person to other individuals in which the more this person expresses opinions predictions and justifications of the collective action that is performed the less is his participation in that action the movement of nations is caused not by power nor by intellectual activity nor even by a combination of the two as historians have supposed but by the activity of all the people who participate in the events and who always combine in such a way that those taking the largest direct share in the event take on themselves the least responsibility and vice versa morally the wielder of power appears to cause the event physically it is those who submit to the power but as the moral activity is inconceivable without the physical the cause of the event is neither in the one nor in the other but in the union of the two or in other words the conception of a cause is inapplicable to the phenomena we are examining in the last analysis we reach the circle of infinity that final limit to which in every domain of thought mans reason arrives if it is not playing with the subject electricity produces heat heat produces electricity atoms attract each other and atoms repel one another speaking of the interaction of heat and electricity and of atoms we cannot say why this occurs and we say that it is so because it is inconceivable otherwise because it must be so and that it is a law the same applies to historical events why war and revolution occur we do not know we only know that to produce the one or the other action people combine in a certain formation in which they all take part and we say that this is so because it is unthinkable otherwise or in other words that it is a law chapter viii if history dealt only with external phenomena the establishment of this simple and obvious law would suffice and we should have finished our argument but the law of history relates to man a particle of matter cannot tell us that it does not feel the law of attraction or repulsion and that that law is untrue but man who is the subject of history says plainly i am free and am therefore not subject to the law the presence of the problem of mans free will though unexpressed is felt at every step of history all seriously thinking historians have involuntarily encountered this question all the contradictions and obscurities of history and the false path historical science has followed are due solely to the lack of a solution of that question if the will of every man were free that is if each man could act as he pleased all history would be a series of disconnected incidents if in a thousand years even one man in a million could act freely that is as he chose it is evident that one single free act of that mans in violation of the laws governing human action would destroy the possibility of the existence of any laws for the whole of humanity if there be a single law governing the actions of men free will cannot exist for then mans will is subject to that law in this contradiction lies the problem of free will which from most ancient times has occupied the best human minds and from most ancient times has been presented in its whole tremendous significance the problem is that regarding man as a subject of observation from whatever point of view theological historical ethical or philosophic we find a general law of necessity to which he like all that exists is subject but regarding him from within ourselves as what we are conscious of we feel ourselves to be free this consciousness is a source of self-cognition quite apart from and independent of reason through his reason man observes himself but only through consciousness does he know himself apart from consciousness of self no observation or application of reason is conceivable to understand observe and draw conclusions man must first of all be conscious of himself
