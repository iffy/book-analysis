they break into the cellars and stores containing army supplies others have disgraced themselves to the extent of disobeying sentinels and officers and have abused and beaten them the grand marshal of the palace wrote the governor complains bitterly that in spite of repeated orders the soldiers continue to commit nuisances in all the courtyards and even under the very windows of the emperor that army like a herd of cattle run wild and trampling underfoot the provender which might have saved it from starvation disintegrated and perished with each additional day it remained in moscow but it did not go away it began to run away only when suddenly seized by a panic caused by the capture of transport trains on the smolnsk road and by the battle of tartino the news of that battle of tartino unexpectedly received by napoleon at a review evoked in him a desire to punish the russians thiers says and he issued the order for departure which the whole army was demanding fleeing from moscow the soldiers took with them everything they had stolen napoleon too carried away his own personal trsor but on seeing the baggage trains that impeded the army he was thiers says horror-struck and yet with his experience of war he did not order all the superfluous vehicles to be burned as he had done with those of a certain marshal when approaching moscow he gazed at the calches and carriages in which soldiers were riding and remarked that it was a very good thing as those vehicles could be used to carry provisions the sick and the wounded the plight of the whole army resembled that of a wounded animal which feels it is perishing and does not know what it is doing to study the skillful tactics and aims of napoleon and his army from the time it entered moscow till it was destroyed is like studying the dying leaps and shudders of a mortally wounded animal very often a wounded animal hearing a rustle rushes straight at the hunters gun runs forward and back again and hastens its own end napoleon under pressure from his whole army did the same thing the rustle of the battle of tartino frightened the beast and it rushed forward onto the hunters gun reached him turned back and finally like any wild beast ran back along the most disadvantageous and dangerous path where the old scent was familiar during the whole of that period napoleon who seems to us to have been the leader of all these movements as the figurehead of a ship may seem to a savage to guide the vessel acted like a child who holding a couple of strings inside a carriage thinks he is driving it chapter xi early in the morning of the sixth of october pierre went out of the shed and on returning stopped by the door to play with a little blue-gray dog with a long body and short bandy legs that jumped about him this little dog lived in their shed sleeping beside karatev at night it sometimes made excursions into the town but always returned again probably it had never had an owner and it still belonged to nobody and had no name the french called it azor the soldier who told stories called it femglka karatev and others called it gray or sometimes flabby its lack of a master a name or even of a breed or any definite color did not seem to trouble the blue-gray dog in the least its furry tail stood up firm and round as a plume its bandy legs served it so well that it would often gracefully lift a hind leg and run very easily and quickly on three legs as if disdaining to use all four everything pleased it now it would roll on its back yelping with delight now bask in the sun with a thoughtful air of importance and now frolic about playing with a chip of wood or a straw pierres attire by now consisted of a dirty torn shirt the only remnant of his former clothing a pair of soldiers trousers which by karatevs advice he tied with string round the ankles for warmth and a peasant coat and cap physically he had changed much during this time he no longer seemed stout though he still had the appearance of solidity and strength hereditary in his family a beard and mustache covered the lower part of his face and a tangle of hair infested with lice curled round
