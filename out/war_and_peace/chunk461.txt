as a result of the loss of the shevrdino redoubt the russians fought the battle of borodin on an open and almost unentrenched position with forces only half as numerous as the french that is to say under conditions in which it was not merely unthinkable to fight for ten hours and secure an indecisive result but unthinkable to keep an army even from complete disintegration and flight chapter xx on the morning of the twenty-fifth pierre was leaving mozhysk at the descent of the high steep hill down which a winding road led out of the town past the cathedral on the right where a service was being held and the bells were ringing pierre got out of his vehicle and proceeded on foot behind him a cavalry regiment was coming down the hill preceded by its singers coming up toward him was a train of carts carrying men who had been wounded in the engagement the day before the peasant drivers shouting and lashing their horses kept crossing from side to side the carts in each of which three or four wounded soldiers were lying or sitting jolted over the stones that had been thrown on the steep incline to make it something like a road the wounded bandaged with rags with pale cheeks compressed lips and knitted brows held on to the sides of the carts as they were jolted against one another almost all of them stared with nave childlike curiosity at pierres white hat and green swallow-tail coat pierres coachman shouted angrily at the convoy of wounded to keep to one side of the road the cavalry regiment as it descended the hill with its singers surrounded pierres carriage and blocked the road pierre stopped being pressed against the side of the cutting in which the road ran the sunshine from behind the hill did not penetrate into the cutting and there it was cold and damp but above pierres head was the bright august sunshine and the bells sounded merrily one of the carts with wounded stopped by the side of the road close to pierre the driver in his bast shoes ran panting up to it placed a stone under one of its tireless hind wheels and began arranging the breech-band on his little horse one of the wounded an old soldier with a bandaged arm who was following the cart on foot caught hold of it with his sound hand and turned to look at pierre i say fellow countryman will they set us down here or take us on to moscow he asked pierre was so deep in thought that he did not hear the question he was looking now at the cavalry regiment that had met the convoy of wounded now at the cart by which he was standing in which two wounded men were sitting and one was lying one of those sitting up in the cart had probably been wounded in the cheek his whole head was wrapped in rags and one cheek was swollen to the size of a babys head his nose and mouth were twisted to one side this soldier was looking at the cathedral and crossing himself another a young lad a fair-haired recruit as white as though there was no blood in his thin face looked at pierre kindly with a fixed smile the third lay prone so that his face was not visible the cavalry singers were passing close by ah lost quite lost is my head so keen living in a foreign land they sang their soldiers dance song as if responding to them but with a different sort of merriment the metallic sound of the bells reverberated high above and the hot rays of the sun bathed the top of the opposite slope with yet another sort of merriment but beneath the slope by the cart with the wounded near the panting little nag where pierre stood it was damp somber and sad the soldier with the swollen cheek looked angrily at the cavalry singers oh the coxcombs he muttered reproachfully its not the soldiers only but ive seen peasants today too the peasants even they have to go said the soldier behind the cart addressing pierre with a sad smile no distinctions made nowadays they want the whole nation to fall on them in a word its moscow they want to make an end of it in spite of the obscurity of the soldiers words pierre understood what he wanted to say and nodded approval the road was clear again pierre
