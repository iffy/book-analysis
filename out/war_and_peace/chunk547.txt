it is impossible not to see that there could be no such direct cause of the fire for moscow had to burn as every village factory or house must burn which is left by its owners and in which strangers are allowed to live and cook their porridge moscow was burned by its inhabitants it is true but by those who had abandoned it and not by those who remained in it moscow when occupied by the enemy did not remain intact like berlin vienna and other towns simply because its inhabitants abandoned it and did not welcome the french with bread and salt nor bring them the keys of the city chapter xxvii the absorption of the french by moscow radiating starwise as it did only reached the quarter where pierre was staying by the evening of the second of september after the last two days spent in solitude and unusual circumstances pierre was in a state bordering on insanity he was completely obsessed by one persistent thought he did not know how or when this thought had taken such possession of him but he remembered nothing of the past understood nothing of the present and all he saw and heard appeared to him like a dream he had left home only to escape the intricate tangle of lifes demands that enmeshed him and which in his present condition he was unable to unravel he had gone to joseph alexevichs house on the plea of sorting the deceaseds books and papers only in search of rest from lifes turmoil for in his mind the memory of joseph alexevich was connected with a world of eternal solemn and calm thoughts quite contrary to the restless confusion into which he felt himself being drawn he sought a quiet refuge and in joseph alexevichs study he really found it when he sat with his elbows on the dusty writing table in the deathlike stillness of the study calm and significant memories of the last few days rose one after another in his imagination particularly of the battle of borodin and of that vague sense of his own insignificance and insincerity compared with the truth simplicity and strength of the class of men he mentally classed as they when gersim roused him from his reverie the idea occurred to him of taking part in the popular defense of moscow which he knew was projected and with that object he had asked gersim to get him a peasants coat and a pistol confiding to him his intentions of remaining in joseph alexevichs house and keeping his name secret then during the first day spent in inaction and solitude he tried several times to fix his attention on the masonic manuscripts but was unable to do so the idea that had previously occurred to him of the cabalistic significance of his name in connection with bonapartes more than once vaguely presented itself but the idea that he lrusse besuhof was destined to set a limit to the power of the beast was as yet only one of the fancies that often passed through his mind and left no trace behind when having bought the coat merely with the object of taking part among the people in the defense of moscow pierre had met the rostvs and natsha had said to him are you remaining in moscow how splendid the thought flashed into his mind that it really would be a good thing even if moscow were taken for him to remain there and do what he was predestined to do next day with the sole idea of not sparing himself and not lagging in any way behind them pierre went to the three hills gate but when he returned to the house convinced that moscow would not be defended he suddenly felt that what before had seemed to him merely a possibility had now become absolutely necessary and inevitable he must remain in moscow concealing his name and must meet napoleon and kill him and either perish or put an end to the misery of all europe which it seemed to him was solely due to napoleon pierre knew all the details of the attempt on bonapartes life in by a german student in vienna and knew that the student had been shot and the risk to which he would expose his life by carrying out his design excited him still more two equally strong feelings drew pierre irresistibly to this purpose the first was a feeling of the necessity of sacrifice and suffering in view of
