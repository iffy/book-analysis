the french who were attacking suddenly and without any apparent reason ran back and disappeared from the outskirts and russian sharpshooters showed themselves in the copse it was timkhins company which alone had maintained its order in the wood and having lain in ambush in a ditch now attacked the french unexpectedly timkhin armed only with a sword had rushed at the enemy with such a desperate cry and such mad drunken determination that taken by surprise the french had thrown down their muskets and run dlokhov running beside timkhin killed a frenchman at close quarters and was the first to seize the surrendering french officer by his collar our fugitives returned the battalions re-formed and the french who had nearly cut our left flank in half were for the moment repulsed our reserve units were able to join up and the fight was at an end the regimental commander and major ekonmov had stopped beside a bridge letting the retreating companies pass by them when a soldier came up and took hold of the commanders stirrup almost leaning against him the man was wearing a bluish coat of broadcloth he had no knapsack or cap his head was bandaged and over his shoulder a french munition pouch was slung he had an officers sword in his hand the soldier was pale his blue eyes looked impudently into the commanders face and his lips were smiling though the commander was occupied in giving instructions to major ekonmov he could not help taking notice of the soldier your excellency here are two trophies said dlokhov pointing to the french sword and pouch i have taken an officer prisoner i stopped the company dlokhov breathed heavily from weariness and spoke in abrupt sentences the whole company can bear witness i beg you will remember this your excellency all right all right replied the commander and turned to major ekonmov but dlokhov did not go away he untied the handkerchief around his head pulled it off and showed the blood congealed on his hair a bayonet wound i remained at the front remember your excellency tshins battery had been forgotten and only at the very end of the action did prince bagratin still hearing the cannonade in the center send his orderly staff officer and later prince andrew also to order the battery to retire as quickly as possible when the supports attached to tshins battery had been moved away in the middle of the action by someones order the battery had continued firing and was only not captured by the french because the enemy could not surmise that anyone could have the effrontery to continue firing from four quite undefended guns on the contrary the energetic action of that battery led the french to suppose that here in the center the main russian forces were concentrated twice they had attempted to attack this point but on each occasion had been driven back by grapeshot from the four isolated guns on the hillock soon after prince bagratin had left him tshin had succeeded in setting fire to schn grabern look at them scurrying its burning just see the smoke fine grand look at the smoke the smoke exclaimed the artillerymen brightening up all the guns without waiting for orders were being fired in the direction of the conflagration as if urging each other on the soldiers cried at each shot fine thats good look at it grand the fire fanned by the breeze was rapidly spreading the french columns that had advanced beyond the village went back but as though in revenge for this failure the enemy placed ten guns to the right of the village and began firing them at tshins battery in their childlike glee aroused by the fire and their luck in successfully cannonading the french our artillerymen only noticed this battery when two balls and then four more fell among our guns one knocking over two horses and another tearing off a munition-wagon drivers leg their spirits once roused were however not diminished but only changed character the horses were replaced by others from a reserve gun carriage the wounded were carried away and the four guns were turned against the ten-gun battery tshins companion officer had been killed at the beginning of the engagement and within an hour seventeen of the forty men of the guns crews had been disabled but the artillerymen were still as merry and lively as ever twice they noticed the french appearing below them and then they fired grapeshot at them little tshin moving feebly
