of simple human needs and that all unhappiness arises not from privation but from superfluity and now during these last three weeks of the march he had learned still another new consolatory truth that nothing in this world is terrible he had learned that as there is no condition in which man can be happy and entirely free so there is no condition in which he need be unhappy and lack freedom he learned that suffering and freedom have their limits and that those limits are very near together that the person in a bed of roses with one crumpled petal suffered as keenly as he now sleeping on the bare damp earth with one side growing chilled while the other was warming and that when he had put on tight dancing shoes he had suffered just as he did now when he walked with bare feet that were covered with sores his footgear having long since fallen to pieces he discovered that when he had married his wife of his own free will as it had seemed to him he had been no more free than now when they locked him up at night in a stable of all that he himself subsequently termed his sufferings but which at the time he scarcely felt the worst was the state of his bare raw and scab-covered feet the horseflesh was appetizing and nourishing the saltpeter flavor of the gunpowder they used instead of salt was even pleasant there was no great cold it was always warm walking in the daytime and at night there were the campfires the lice that devoured him warmed his body the one thing that was at first hard to bear was his feet after the second days march pierre having examined his feet by the campfire thought it would be impossible to walk on them but when everybody got up he went along limping and when he had warmed up walked without feeling the pain though at night his feet were more terrible to look at than before however he did not look at them now but thought of other things only now did pierre realize the full strength of life in man and the saving power he has of transferring his attention from one thing to another which is like the safety valve of a boiler that allows superfluous steam to blow off when the pressure exceeds a certain limit he did not see and did not hear how they shot the prisoners who lagged behind though more than a hundred perished in that way he did not think of karatev who grew weaker every day and evidently would soon have to share that fate still less did pierre think about himself the harder his position became and the more terrible the future the more independent of that position in which he found himself were the joyful and comforting thoughts memories and imaginings that came to him chapter xiii at midday on the twenty-second of october pierre was going uphill along the muddy slippery road looking at his feet and at the roughness of the way occasionally he glanced at the familiar crowd around him and then again at his feet the former and the latter were alike familiar and his own the blue-gray bandy legged dog ran merrily along the side of the road sometimes in proof of its agility and self-satisfaction lifting one hind leg and hopping along on three and then again going on all four and rushing to bark at the crows that sat on the carrion the dog was merrier and sleeker than it had been in moscow all around lay the flesh of different animals from men to horses in various stages of decomposition and as the wolves were kept off by the passing men the dog could eat all it wanted it had been raining since morning and had seemed as if at any moment it might cease and the sky clear but after a short break it began raining harder than before the saturated road no longer absorbed the water which ran along the ruts in streams pierre walked along looking from side to side counting his steps in threes and reckoning them off on his fingers mentally addressing the rain he repeated now then now then go on pelt harder it seemed to him that he was thinking of nothing but far down and deep within him his soul was occupied with something important and comforting this something was a most subtle spiritual deduction from a conversation
