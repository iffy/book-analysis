hlne and tickle her at a moment when all was quiet before the commencement of a song a door leading to the stalls on the side nearest the rostvs box creaked and the steps of a belated arrival were heard theres kurgin whispered shinshn countess bezkhova turned smiling to the newcomer and natsha following the direction of that look saw an exceptionally handsome adjutant approaching their box with a self-assured yet courteous bearing this was anatole kurgin whom she had seen and noticed long ago at the ball in petersburg he was now in an adjutants uniform with one epaulet and a shoulder knot he moved with a restrained swagger which would have been ridiculous had he not been so good-looking and had his handsome face not worn such an expression of good-humored complacency and gaiety though the performance was proceeding he walked deliberately down the carpeted gangway his sword and spurs slightly jingling and his handsome perfumed head held high having looked at natsha he approached his sister laid his well gloved hand on the edge of her box nodded to her and leaning forward asked a question with a motion toward natsha mais charmante said he evidently referring to natsha who did not exactly hear his words but understood them from the movement of his lips then he took his place in the first row of the stalls and sat down beside dlokhov nudging with his elbow in a friendly and offhand way that dlokhov whom others treated so fawningly he winked at him gaily smiled and rested his foot against the orchestra screen how like the brother is to the sister remarked the count and how handsome they both are shinshn lowering his voice began to tell the count of some intrigue of kurgins in moscow and natsha tried to overhear it just because he had said she was charmante the first act was over in the stalls everyone began moving about going out and coming in bors came to the rostvs box received their congratulations very simply and raising his eyebrows with an absent-minded smile conveyed to natsha and snya his fiances invitation to her wedding and went away natsha with a gay coquettish smile talked to him and congratulated on his approaching wedding that same bors with whom she had formerly been in love in the state of intoxication she was in everything seemed simple and natural the scantily clad hlne smiled at everyone in the same way and natsha gave bors a similar smile hlnes box was filled and surrounded from the stalls by the most distinguished and intellectual men who seemed to vie with one another in their wish to let everyone see that they knew her during the whole of that entracte kurgin stood with dlokhov in front of the orchestra partition looking at the rostvs box natsha knew he was talking about her and this afforded her pleasure she even turned so that he should see her profile in what she thought was its most becoming aspect before the beginning of the second act pierre appeared in the stalls the rostvs had not seen him since their arrival his face looked sad and he had grown still stouter since natsha last saw him he passed up to the front rows not noticing anyone anatole went up to him and began speaking to him looking at and indicating the rostvs box on seeing natsha pierre grew animated and hastily passing between the rows came toward their box when he got there he leaned on his elbows and smiling talked to her for a long time while conversing with pierre natsha heard a mans voice in countess bezkhovas box and something told her it was kurgin she turned and their eyes met almost smiling he gazed straight into her eyes with such an enraptured caressing look that it seemed strange to be so near him to look at him like that to be so sure he admired her and not to be acquainted with him in the second act there was scenery representing tombstones there was a round hole in the canvas to represent the moon shades were raised over the footlights and from horns and contrabass came deep notes while many people appeared from right and left wearing black cloaks and holding things like daggers in their hands they began waving their arms then some other people ran in and began dragging away the maiden who had been in white and was now in light blue they did not drag her away at once
