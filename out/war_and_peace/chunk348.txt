and talk dressmakers came again mrya dmtrievna appeared and they were called to breakfast natsha kept looking uneasily at everybody with wide-open eyes as if wishing to intercept every glance directed toward her and tried to appear the same as usual after breakfast which was her best time mrya dmtrievna sat down in her armchair and called natsha and the count to her well friends i have now thought the whole matter over and this is my advice she began yesterday as you know i went to see prince bolknski well i had a talk with him he took it into his head to begin shouting but i am not one to be shouted down i said what i had to say well and he asked the count he hes crazy he did not want to listen but whats the use of talking as it is we have worn the poor girl out said mrya dmtrievna my advice to you is finish your business and go back home to otrdnoe and wait there oh no exclaimed natsha yes go back said mrya dmtrievna and wait there if your betrothed comes here now there will be no avoiding a quarrel but alone with the old man he will talk things over and then come on to you count rostv approved of this suggestion appreciating its reasonableness if the old man came round it would be all the better to visit him in moscow or at bald hills later on and if not the wedding against his wishes could only be arranged at otrdnoe that is perfectly true and i am sorry i went to see him and took her said the old count no why be sorry being here you had to pay your respects but if he wont thats his affair said mrya dmtrievna looking for something in her reticule besides the trousseau is ready so there is nothing to wait for and what is not ready ill send after you though i dont like letting you go it is the best way so go with gods blessing having found what she was looking for in the reticule she handed it to natsha it was a letter from princess mary she has written to you how she torments herself poor thing shes afraid you might think that she does not like you but she doesnt like me said natsha dont talk nonsense cried mrya dmtrievna i shant believe anyone i know she doesnt like me replied natsha boldly as she took the letter and her face expressed a cold and angry resolution that caused mrya dmtrievna to look at her more intently and to frown dont answer like that my good girl she said what i say is true write an answer natsha did not reply and went to her own room to read princess marys letter princess mary wrote that she was in despair at the misunderstanding that had occurred between them whatever her fathers feelings might be she begged natsha to believe that she could not help loving her as the one chosen by her brother for whose happiness she was ready to sacrifice everything do not think however she wrote that my father is ill-disposed toward you he is an invalid and an old man who must be forgiven but he is good and magnanimous and will love her who makes his son happy princess mary went on to ask natsha to fix a time when she could see her again after reading the letter natsha sat down at the writing table to answer it dear princess she wrote in french quickly and mechanically and then paused what more could she write after all that had happened the evening before yes yes all that has happened and now all is changed she thought as she sat with the letter she had begun before her must i break off with him must i really thats awful and to escape from these dreadful thoughts she went to snya and began sorting patterns with her after dinner natsha went to her room and again took up princess marys letter can it be that it is all over she thought can it be that all this has happened so quickly and has destroyed all that went before she recalled her love for prince andrew in all its former strength and at the same time felt that she loved kurgin she vividly pictured herself as prince andrews wife and the scenes of happiness with him she had so often repeated in her imagination and
