him and having pressed her hand to his lips had shed gentle happy tears love for a particular woman again crept unobserved into his heart and once more bound him to life and joyful and agitating thoughts began to occupy his mind recalling the moment at the ambulance station when he had seen kurgin he could not now regain the feeling he then had but was tormented by the question whether kurgin was alive and he dared not inquire his illness pursued its normal physical course but what natsha referred to when she said this suddenly happened had occurred two days before princess mary arrived it was the last spiritual struggle between life and death in which death gained the victory it was the unexpected realization of the fact that he still valued life as presented to him in the form of his love for natsha and a last though ultimately vanquished attack of terror before the unknown it was evening as usual after dinner he was slightly feverish and his thoughts were preternaturally clear snya was sitting by the table he began to doze suddenly a feeling of happiness seized him ah she has come thought he and so it was in snyas place sat natsha who had just come in noiselessly since she had begun looking after him he had always experienced this physical consciousness of her nearness she was sitting in an armchair placed sideways screening the light of the candle from him and was knitting a stocking she had learned to knit stockings since prince andrew had casually mentioned that no one nursed the sick so well as old nurses who knit stockings and that there is something soothing in the knitting of stockings the needles clicked lightly in her slender rapidly moving hands and he could clearly see the thoughtful profile of her drooping face she moved and the ball rolled off her knees she started glanced round at him and screening the candle with her hand stooped carefully with a supple and exact movement picked up the ball and regained her former position he looked at her without moving and saw that she wanted to draw a deep breath after stooping but refrained from doing so and breathed cautiously at the tritsa monastery they had spoken of the past and he had told her that if he lived he would always thank god for his wound which had brought them together again but after that they never spoke of the future can it or can it not be he now thought as he looked at her and listened to the light click of the steel needles can fate have brought me to her so strangely only for me to die is it possible that the truth of life has been revealed to me only to show me that i have spent my life in falsity i love her more than anything in the world but what am i to do if i love her he thought and he involuntarily groaned from a habit acquired during his sufferings on hearing that sound natsha put down the stocking leaned nearer to him and suddenly noticing his shining eyes stepped lightly up to him and bent over him you are not asleep no i have been looking at you a long time i felt you come in no one else gives me that sense of soft tranquillity that you do that light i want to weep for joy natsha drew closer to him her face shone with rapturous joy natsha i love you too much more than anything in the world and i she turned away for an instant why too much she asked why too much well what do you what do you feel in your soul your whole soul shall i live what do you think i am sure of it sure natsha almost shouted taking hold of both his hands with a passionate movement he remained silent awhile how good it would be and taking her hand he kissed it natsha felt happy and agitated but at once remembered that this would not do and that he had to be quiet but you have not slept she said repressing her joy try to sleep please he pressed her hand and released it and she went back to the candle and sat down again in her former position twice she turned and looked at him and her eyes met his beaming at her she set herself a task on her stocking and resolved not to turn round
