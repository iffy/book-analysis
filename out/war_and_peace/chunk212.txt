combat the evil which sways the world think this over and i will come to you again to combat the evil which sways the world pierre repeated and a mental image of his future activity in this direction rose in his mind he imagined men such as he had himself been a fortnight ago and he addressed an edifying exhortation to them he imagined to himself vicious and unfortunate people whom he would assist by word and deed imagined oppressors whose victims he would rescue of the three objects mentioned by the rhetor this last that of improving mankind especially appealed to pierre the important mystery mentioned by the rhetor though it aroused his curiosity did not seem to him essential and the second aim that of purifying and regenerating himself did not much interest him because at that moment he felt with delight that he was already perfectly cured of his former faults and was ready for all that was good half an hour later the rhetor returned to inform the seeker of the seven virtues corresponding to the seven steps of solomons temple which every freemason should cultivate in himself these virtues were discretion the keeping of the secrets of the order obedience to those of higher ranks in the order morality love of mankind courage generosity the love of death in the seventh place try by the frequent thought of death the rhetor said to bring yourself to regard it not as a dreaded foe but as a friend that frees the soul grown weary in the labors of virtue from this distressful life and leads it to its place of recompense and peace yes that must be so thought pierre when after these words the rhetor went away leaving him to solitary meditation it must be so but i am still so weak that i love my life the meaning of which is only now gradually opening before me but five of the other virtues which pierre recalled counting them on his fingers he felt already in his soul courage generosity morality love of mankind and especially obedience which did not even seem to him a virtue but a joy he now felt so glad to be free from his own lawlessness and to submit his will to those who knew the indubitable truth he forgot what the seventh virtue was and could not recall it the third time the rhetor came back more quickly and asked pierre whether he was still firm in his intention and determined to submit to all that would be required of him i am ready for everything said pierre i must also inform you said the rhetor that our order delivers its teaching not in words only but also by other means which may perhaps have a stronger effect on the sincere seeker after wisdom and virtue than mere words this chamber with what you see therein should already have suggested to your heart if it is sincere more than words could do you will perhaps also see in your further initiation a like method of enlightenment our order imitates the ancient societies that explained their teaching by hieroglyphics a hieroglyph said the rhetor is an emblem of something not cognizable by the senses but which possesses qualities resembling those of the symbol pierre knew very well what a hieroglyph was but dared not speak he listened to the rhetor in silence feeling from all he said that his ordeal was about to begin if you are resolved i must begin your initiation said the rhetor coming closer to pierre in token of generosity i ask you to give me all your valuables but i have nothing here replied pierre supposing that he was asked to give up all he possessed what you have with you watch money rings pierre quickly took out his purse and watch but could not manage for some time to get the wedding ring off his fat finger when that had been done the rhetor said in token of obedience i ask you to undress pierre took off his coat waistcoat and left boot according to the rhetors instructions the mason drew the shirt back from pierres left breast and stooping down pulled up the left leg of his trousers to above the knee pierre hurriedly began taking off his right boot also and was going to tuck up the other trouser leg to save this stranger the trouble but the mason told him that was not necessary and gave him a slipper for his left foot
