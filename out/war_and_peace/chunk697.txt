he asked himself before he had solved that point he glanced again at her face filled with love and pain and he suddenly realized that she was right and that he had long been sinning against himself mary he said softly going up to her it will never happen again i give you my word never he repeated in a trembling voice like a boy asking for forgiveness the tears flowed faster still from the countess eyes she took his hand and kissed it nicholas when did you break your cameo she asked to change the subject looking at his finger on which he wore a ring with a cameo of laocons head today it was the same affair oh mary dont remind me of it and again he flushed i give you my word of honor it shant occur again and let this always be a reminder to me and he pointed to the broken ring after that when in discussions with his village elders or stewards the blood rushed to his face and his fists began to clench nicholas would turn the broken ring on his finger and would drop his eyes before the man who was making him angry but he did forget himself once or twice within a twelvemonth and then he would go and confess to his wife and would again promise that this should really be the very last time mary you must despise me he would say i deserve it you should go go away at once if you dont feel strong enough to control yourself she would reply sadly trying to comfort her husband among the gentry of the province nicholas was respected but not liked he did not concern himself with the interests of his own class and consequently some thought him proud and others thought him stupid the whole summer from spring sowing to harvest he was busy with the work on his farm in autumn he gave himself up to hunting with the same business-like seriousness leaving home for a month or even two with his hunt in winter he visited his other villages or spent his time reading the books he read were chiefly historical and on these he spent a certain sum every year he was collecting as he said a serious library and he made it a rule to read through all the books he bought he would sit in his study with a grave air reading a task he first imposed upon himself as a duty but which afterwards became a habit affording him a special kind of pleasure and a consciousness of being occupied with serious matters in winter except for business excursions he spent most of his time at home making himself one with his family and entering into all the details of his childrens relations with their mother the harmony between him and his wife grew closer and closer and he daily discovered fresh spiritual treasures in her from the time of his marriage snya had lived in his house before that nicholas had told his wife all that had passed between himself and snya blaming himself and commending her he had asked princess mary to be gentle and kind to his cousin she thoroughly realized the wrong he had done snya felt herself to blame toward her and imagined that her wealth had influenced nicholas choice she could not find fault with snya in any way and tried to be fond of her but often felt ill-will toward her which she could not overcome once she had a talk with her friend natsha about snya and about her own injustice toward her you know said natsha you have read the gospels a great deal there is a passage in them that just fits snya what asked countess mary surprised to him that hath shall be given and from him that hath not shall be taken away you remember she is one that hath not why i dont know perhaps she lacks egotism i dont know but from her is taken away and everything has been taken away sometimes i am dreadfully sorry for her formerly i very much wanted nicholas to marry her but i always had a sort of presentiment that it would not come off she is a sterile flower you know like some strawberry blossoms sometimes i am sorry for her and sometimes i think she doesnt feel it as you or i would though countess mary told natsha that those words in the gospel must be understood differently yet
