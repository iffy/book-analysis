merrier and some of them could not refrain from laughter for which they hurriedly sought plausible pretexts when he had gone taking his wife with him and had settled down with her in their covered cart the officers lay down in the tavern covering themselves with their wet cloaks but they did not sleep for a long time now they exchanged remarks recalling the doctors uneasiness and his wifes delight now they ran out into the porch and reported what was taking place in the covered trap several times rostv covering his head tried to go to sleep but some remark would arouse him and conversation would be resumed to the accompaniment of unreasoning merry childlike laughter chapter xiv it was nearly three oclock but no one was yet asleep when the quartermaster appeared with an order to move on to the little town of ostrvna still laughing and talking the officers began hurriedly getting ready and again boiled some muddy water in the samovar but rostv went off to his squadron without waiting for tea day was breaking the rain had ceased and the clouds were dispersing it felt damp and cold especially in clothes that were still moist as they left the tavern in the twilight of the dawn rostv and ilyn both glanced under the wet and glistening leather hood of the doctors cart from under the apron of which his feet were sticking out and in the middle of which his wifes nightcap was visible and her sleepy breathing audible she really is a dear little thing said rostv to ilyn who was following him a charming woman said ilyn with all the gravity of a boy of sixteen half an hour later the squadron was lined up on the road the command was heard to mount and the soldiers crossed themselves and mounted rostv riding in front gave the order forward and the hussars with clanking sabers and subdued talk their horses hoofs splashing in the mud defiled in fours and moved along the broad road planted with birch trees on each side following the infantry and a battery that had gone on in front tattered blue-purple clouds reddening in the east were scudding before the wind it was growing lighter and lighter that curly grass which always grows by country roadsides became clearly visible still wet with the nights rain the drooping branches of the birches also wet swayed in the wind and flung down bright drops of water to one side the soldiers faces were more and more clearly visible rostv always closely followed by ilyn rode along the side of the road between two rows of birch trees when campaigning rostv allowed himself the indulgence of riding not a regimental but a cossack horse a judge of horses and a sportsman he had lately procured himself a large fine mettlesome donts horse dun-colored with light mane and tail and when he rode it no one could outgallop him to ride this horse was a pleasure to him and he thought of the horse of the morning of the doctors wife but not once of the impending danger formerly when going into action rostv had felt afraid now he had not the least feeling of fear he was fearless not because he had grown used to being under fire one cannot grow used to danger but because he had learned how to manage his thoughts when in danger he had grown accustomed when going into action to think about anything but what would seem most likely to interest him the impending danger during the first period of his service hard as he tried and much as he reproached himself with cowardice he had not been able to do this but with time it had come of itself now he rode beside ilyn under the birch trees occasionally plucking leaves from a branch that met his hand sometimes touching his horses side with his foot or without turning round handing a pipe he had finished to an hussar riding behind him with as calm and careless an air as though he were merely out for a ride he glanced with pity at the excited face of ilyn who talked much and in great agitation he knew from experience the tormenting expectation of terror and death the cornet was suffering and knew that only time could help him as soon as the sun appeared in a clear strip of sky beneath the clouds the wind fell as if it dared not spoil the beauty of the summer
