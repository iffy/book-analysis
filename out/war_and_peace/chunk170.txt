giving it the rein leaped lightly over only a little earth crumbled from the bank under the horses hind hoofs turning the horse sharply he again jumped the ditch and deferentially addressed the horseman with the white plumes evidently suggesting that he should do the same the rider whose figure seemed familiar to rostv and involuntarily riveted his attention made a gesture of refusal with his head and hand and by that gesture rostv instantly recognized his lamented and adored monarch but it cant be he alone in the midst of this empty field thought rostv at that moment alexander turned his head and rostv saw the beloved features that were so deeply engraved on his memory the emperor was pale his cheeks sunken and his eyes hollow but the charm the mildness of his features was all the greater rostv was happy in the assurance that the rumors about the emperor being wounded were false he was happy to be seeing him he knew that he might and even ought to go straight to him and give the message dolgorkov had ordered him to deliver but as a youth in love trembles is unnerved and dares not utter the thoughts he has dreamed of for nights but looks around for help or a chance of delay and flight when the longed-for moment comes and he is alone with her so rostv now that he had attained what he had longed for more than anything else in the world did not know how to approach the emperor and a thousand reasons occurred to him why it would be inconvenient unseemly and impossible to do so what it is as if i were glad of a chance to take advantage of his being alone and despondent a strange face may seem unpleasant or painful to him at this moment of sorrow besides what can i say to him now when my heart fails me and my mouth feels dry at the mere sight of him not one of the innumerable speeches addressed to the emperor that he had composed in his imagination could he now recall those speeches were intended for quite other conditions they were for the most part to be spoken at a moment of victory and triumph generally when he was dying of wounds and the sovereign had thanked him for heroic deeds and while dying he expressed the love his actions had proved besides how can i ask the emperor for his instructions for the right flank now that it is nearly four oclock and the battle is lost no certainly i must not approach him i must not intrude on his reflections better die a thousand times than risk receiving an unkind look or bad opinion from him rostv decided and sorrowfully and with a heart full despair he rode away continually looking back at the tsar who still remained in the same attitude of indecision while rostv was thus arguing with himself and riding sadly away captain von toll chanced to ride to the same spot and seeing the emperor at once rode up to him offered his services and assisted him to cross the ditch on foot the emperor wishing to rest and feeling unwell sat down under an apple tree and von toll remained beside him rostv from a distance saw with envy and remorse how von toll spoke long and warmly to the emperor and how the emperor evidently weeping covered his eyes with his hand and pressed von tolls hand and i might have been in his place thought rostv and hardly restraining his tears of pity for the emperor he rode on in utter despair not knowing where to or why he was now riding his despair was all the greater from feeling that his own weakness was the cause of his grief he might not only might but should have gone up to the sovereign it was a unique chance to show his devotion to the emperor and he had not made use of it what have i done thought he and he turned round and galloped back to the place where he had seen the emperor but there was no one beyond the ditch now only some carts and carriages were passing by from one of the drivers he learned that kutzovs staff were not far off in the village the vehicles were going to rostv followed them in front of him walked kutzovs groom leading horses in horsecloths then came a cart and behind that walked an old bandy-legged
