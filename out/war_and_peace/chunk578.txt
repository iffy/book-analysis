a possible wife adapting her in his imagination to all the conditions of married life a white dressing gown his wife at the tea table his wifes carriage little ones mamma and papa their relations to her and so on and these pictures of the future had given him pleasure but with princess mary to whom they were trying to get him engaged he could never picture anything of future married life if he tried his pictures seemed incongruous and false it made him afraid chapter vii the dreadful news of the battle of borodin of our losses in killed and wounded and the still more terrible news of the loss of moscow reached vornezh in the middle of september princess mary having learned of her brothers wound only from the gazette and having no definite news of him prepared so nicholas heard he had not seen her again himself to set off in search of prince andrew when he received the news of the battle of borodin and the abandonment of moscow rostv was not seized with despair anger the desire for vengeance or any feeling of that kind but everything in vornezh suddenly seemed to him dull and tiresome and he experienced an indefinite feeling of shame and awkwardness the conversations he heard seemed to him insincere he did not know how to judge all these affairs and felt that only in the regiment would everything again become clear to him he made haste to finish buying the horses and often became unreasonably angry with his servant and squadron quartermaster a few days before his departure a special thanksgiving at which nicholas was present was held in the cathedral for the russian victory he stood a little behind the governor and held himself with military decorum through the service meditating on a great variety of subjects when the service was over the governors wife beckoned him to her have you seen the princess she asked indicating with a movement of her head a lady standing on the opposite side beyond the choir nicholas immediately recognized princess mary not so much by the profile he saw under her bonnet as by the feeling of solicitude timidity and pity that immediately overcame him princess mary evidently engrossed by her thoughts was crossing herself for the last time before leaving the church nicholas looked at her face with surprise it was the same face he had seen before there was the same general expression of refined inner spiritual labor but now it was quite differently lit up there was a pathetic expression of sorrow prayer and hope in it as had occurred before when she was present nicholas went up to her without waiting to be prompted by the governors wife and not asking himself whether or not it was right and proper to address her here in church and told her he had heard of her trouble and sympathized with his whole soul as soon as she heard his voice a vivid glow kindled in her face lighting up both her sorrow and her joy there is one thing i wanted to tell you princess said rostv it is that if your brother prince andrew nikolevich were not living it would have been at once announced in the gazette as he is a colonel the princess looked at him not grasping what he was saying but cheered by the expression of regretful sympathy on his face and i have known so many cases of a splinter wound the gazette said it was a shell either proving fatal at once or being very slight continued nicholas we must hope for the best and i am sure princess mary interrupted him oh that would be so dread she began and prevented by agitation from finishing she bent her head with a movement as graceful as everything she did in his presence and looking up at him gratefully went out following her aunt that evening nicholas did not go out but stayed at home to settle some accounts with the horse dealers when he had finished that business it was already too late to go anywhere but still too early to go to bed and for a long time he paced up and down the room reflecting on his life a thing he rarely did princess mary had made an agreeable impression on him when he had met her in smolnsk province his having encountered her in such exceptional circumstances and his mother having at one time mentioned her to him as a good match
