steward who considered the young counts attempts almost insane unprofitable to himself to the count and to the serfs made some concessions continuing to represent the liberation of the serfs as impracticable he arranged for the erection of large buildings schools hospitals and asylums on all the estates before the master arrived everywhere preparations were made not for ceremonious welcomes which he knew pierre would not like but for just such gratefully religious ones with offerings of icons and the bread and salt of hospitality as according to his understanding of his master would touch and delude him the southern spring the comfortable rapid traveling in a vienna carriage and the solitude of the road all had a gladdening effect on pierre the estates he had not before visited were each more picturesque than the other the serfs everywhere seemed thriving and touchingly grateful for the benefits conferred on them everywhere were receptions which though they embarrassed pierre awakened a joyful feeling in the depth of his heart in one place the peasants presented him with bread and salt and an icon of saint peter and saint paul asking permission as a mark of their gratitude for the benefits he had conferred on them to build a new chantry to the church at their own expense in honor of peter and paul his patron saints in another place the women with infants in arms met him to thank him for releasing them from hard work on a third estate the priest bearing a cross came to meet him surrounded by children whom by the counts generosity he was instructing in reading writing and religion on all his estates pierre saw with his own eyes brick buildings erected or in course of erection all on one plan for hospitals schools and almshouses which were soon to be opened everywhere he saw the stewards accounts according to which the serfs manorial labor had been diminished and heard the touching thanks of deputations of serfs in their full-skirted blue coats what pierre did not know was that the place where they presented him with bread and salt and wished to build a chantry in honor of peter and paul was a market village where a fair was held on st peters day and that the richest peasants who formed the deputation had begun the chantry long before but that nine tenths of the peasants in that villages were in a state of the greatest poverty he did not know that since the nursing mothers were no longer sent to work on his land they did still harder work on their own land he did not know that the priest who met him with the cross oppressed the peasants by his exactions and that the pupils parents wept at having to let him take their children and secured their release by heavy payments he did not know that the brick buildings built to plan were being built by serfs whose manorial labor was thus increased though lessened on paper he did not know that where the steward had shown him in the accounts that the serfs payments had been diminished by a third their obligatory manorial work had been increased by a half and so pierre was delighted with his visit to his estates and quite recovered the philanthropic mood in which he had left petersburg and wrote enthusiastic letters to his brother-instructor as he called the grand master how easy it is how little effort it needs to do so much good thought pierre and how little attention we pay to it he was pleased at the gratitude he received but felt abashed at receiving it this gratitude reminded him of how much more he might do for these simple kindly people the chief steward a very stupid but cunning man who saw perfectly through the nave and intelligent count and played with him as with a toy seeing the effect these prearranged receptions had on pierre pressed him still harder with proofs of the impossibility and above all the uselessness of freeing the serfs who were quite happy as it was pierre in his secret soul agreed with the steward that it would be difficult to imagine happier people and that god only knew what would happen to them when they were free but he insisted though reluctantly on what he thought right the steward promised to do all in his power to carry out the counts wishes seeing clearly that not only would the count never be able to find out whether all
