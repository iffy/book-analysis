plan of campaign that work of genius of which thiers remarks that his genius never devised anything more profound more skillful or more admirable and enters into a polemic with m fain to prove that this work of genius must be referred not to the fourth but to the fifteenth of october that plan never was or could be executed for it was quite out of touch with the facts of the case the fortifying of the krmlin for which la mosque as napoleon termed the church of basil the beatified was to have been razed to the ground proved quite useless the mining of the krmlin only helped toward fulfilling napoleons wish that it should be blown up when he left moscow as a child wants the floor on which he has hurt himself to be beaten the pursuit of the russian army about which napoleon was so concerned produced an unheard-of result the french generals lost touch with the russian army of sixty thousand men and according to thiers it was only eventually found like a lost pin by the skill and apparently the genius of murat with reference to diplomacy all napoleons arguments as to his magnanimity and justice both to tutlmin and to ykovlev whose chief concern was to obtain a greatcoat and a conveyance proved useless alexander did not receive these envoys and did not reply to their embassage with regard to legal matters after the execution of the supposed incendiaries the rest of moscow burned down with regard to administrative matters the establishment of a municipality did not stop the robberies and was only of use to certain people who formed part of that municipality and under pretext of preserving order looted moscow or saved their own property from being looted with regard to religion as to which in egypt matters had so easily been settled by napoleons visit to a mosque no results were achieved two or three priests who were found in moscow did try to carry out napoleons wish but one of them was slapped in the face by a french soldier while conducting service and a french official reported of another that the priest whom i found and invited to say mass cleaned and locked up the church that night the doors were again broken open the padlocks smashed the books mutilated and other disorders perpetrated with reference to commerce the proclamation to industrious workmen and to peasants evoked no response there were no industrious workmen and the peasants caught the commissaries who ventured too far out of town with the proclamation and killed them as to the theaters for the entertainment of the people and the troops these did not meet with success either the theaters set up in the krmlin and in posnykovs house were closed again at once because the actors and actresses were robbed even philanthropy did not have the desired effect the genuine as well as the false paper money which flooded moscow lost its value the french collecting booty cared only for gold not only was the paper money valueless which napoleon so graciously distributed to the unfortunate but even silver lost its value in relation to gold but the most amazing example of the ineffectiveness of the orders given by the authorities at that time was napoleons attempt to stop the looting and re-establish discipline this is what the army authorities were reporting looting continues in the city despite the decrees against it order is not yet restored and not a single merchant is carrying on trade in a lawful manner the sutlers alone venture to trade and they sell stolen goods the neighborhood of my ward continues to be pillaged by soldiers of the rd corps who not satisfied with taking from the unfortunate inhabitants hiding in the cellars the little they have left even have the ferocity to wound them with their sabers as i have repeatedly witnessed nothing new except that the soldiers are robbing and pillaging october robbery and pillaging continue there is a band of thieves in our district who ought to be arrested by a strong force october the emperor is extremely displeased that despite the strict orders to stop pillage parties of marauding guards are continually seen returning to the krmlin among the old guard disorder and pillage were renewed more violently than ever yesterday evening last night and today the emperor sees with regret that the picked soldiers appointed to guard his person who should set an example of discipline carry disobedience to such a point that
