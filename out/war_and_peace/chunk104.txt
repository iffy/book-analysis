the horizon bounded by the adjacent wood prince bagratin ordered two battalions from the center to be sent to reinforce the right flank the officer of the suite ventured to remark to the prince that if these battalions went away the guns would remain without support prince bagratin turned to the officer and with his dull eyes looked at him in silence it seemed to prince andrew that the officers remark was just and that really no answer could be made to it but at that moment an adjutant galloped up with a message from the commander of the regiment in the hollow and news that immense masses of the french were coming down upon them and that his regiment was in disorder and was retreating upon the kiev grenadiers prince bagratin bowed his head in sign of assent and approval he rode off at a walk to the right and sent an adjutant to the dragoons with orders to attack the french but this adjutant returned half an hour later with the news that the commander of the dragoons had already retreated beyond the dip in the ground as a heavy fire had been opened on him and he was losing men uselessly and so had hastened to throw some sharpshooters into the wood very good said bagratin as he was leaving the battery firing was heard on the left also and as it was too far to the left flank for him to have time to go there himself prince bagratin sent zherkv to tell the general in command the one who had paraded his regiment before kutzov at braunau that he must retreat as quickly as possible behind the hollow in the rear as the right flank would probably not be able to withstand the enemys attack very long about tshin and the battalion that had been in support of his battery all was forgotten prince andrew listened attentively to bagratins colloquies with the commanding officers and the orders he gave them and to his surprise found that no orders were really given but that prince bagratin tried to make it appear that everything done by necessity by accident or by the will of subordinate commanders was done if not by his direct command at least in accord with his intentions prince andrew noticed however that though what happened was due to chance and was independent of the commanders will owing to the tact bagratin showed his presence was very valuable officers who approached him with disturbed countenances became calm soldiers and officers greeted him gaily grew more cheerful in his presence and were evidently anxious to display their courage before him chapter xviii prince bagratin having reached the highest point of our right flank began riding downhill to where the roll of musketry was heard but where on account of the smoke nothing could be seen the nearer they got to the hollow the less they could see but the more they felt the nearness of the actual battlefield they began to meet wounded men one with a bleeding head and no cap was being dragged along by two soldiers who supported him under the arms there was a gurgle in his throat and he was spitting blood a bullet had evidently hit him in the throat or mouth another was walking sturdily by himself but without his musket groaning aloud and swinging his arm which had just been hurt while blood from it was streaming over his greatcoat as from a bottle he had that moment been wounded and his face showed fear rather than suffering crossing a road they descended a steep incline and saw several men lying on the ground they also met a crowd of soldiers some of whom were unwounded the soldiers were ascending the hill breathing heavily and despite the generals presence were talking loudly and gesticulating in front of them rows of gray cloaks were already visible through the smoke and an officer catching sight of bagratin rushed shouting after the crowd of retreating soldiers ordering them back bagratin rode up to the ranks along which shots crackled now here and now there drowning the sound of voices and the shouts of command the whole air reeked with smoke the excited faces of the soldiers were blackened with it some were using their ramrods others putting powder on the touchpans or taking charges from their pouches while others were firing though who they were firing at could not be seen for the smoke which there was no wind to carry away
