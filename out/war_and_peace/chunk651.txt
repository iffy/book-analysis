that man did not execute such and such maneuvers but why did they not execute those maneuvers and why if they were guilty of not carrying out a prearranged plan were they not tried and punished but even if we admitted that kutzov chichagv and others were the cause of the russian failures it is still incomprehensible why the position of the russian army being what it was at krsnoe and at the berzina in both cases we had superior forces the french army with its marshals kings and emperor was not captured if that was what the russians aimed at the explanation of this strange fact given by russian military historians to the effect that kutzov hindered an attack is unfounded for we know that he could not restrain the troops from attacking at vyzma and tartino why was the russian army which with inferior forces had withstood the enemy in full strength at borodin defeated at krsnoe and the berzina by the disorganized crowds of the french when it was numerically superior if the aim of the russians consisted in cutting off and capturing napoleon and his marshals and that aim was not merely frustrated but all attempts to attain it were most shamefully baffled then this last period of the campaign is quite rightly considered by the french to be a series of victories and quite wrongly considered victorious by russian historians the russian military historians in so far as they submit to claims of logic must admit that conclusion and in spite of their lyrical rhapsodies about valor devotion and so forth must reluctantly admit that the french retreat from moscow was a series of victories for napoleon and defeats for kutzov but putting national vanity entirely aside one feels that such a conclusion involves a contradiction since the series of french victories brought the french complete destruction while the series of russian defeats led to the total destruction of their enemy and the liberation of their country the source of this contradiction lies in the fact that the historians studying the events from the letters of the sovereigns and the generals from memoirs reports projects and so forth have attributed to this last period of the war of an aim that never existed namely that of cutting off and capturing napoleon with his marshals and his army there never was or could have been such an aim for it would have been senseless and its attainment quite impossible it would have been senseless first because napoleons disorganized army was flying from russia with all possible speed that is to say was doing just what every russian desired so what was the use of performing various operations on the french who were running away as fast as they possibly could secondly it would have been senseless to block the passage of men whose whole energy was directed to flight thirdly it would have been senseless to sacrifice ones own troops in order to destroy the french army which without external interference was destroying itself at such a rate that though its path was not blocked it could not carry across the frontier more than it actually did in december namely a hundredth part of the original army fourthly it would have been senseless to wish to take captive the emperor kings and dukes whose capture would have been in the highest degree embarrassing for the russians as the most adroit diplomatists of the time joseph de maistre and others recognized still more senseless would have been the wish to capture army corps of the french when our own army had melted away to half before reaching krsnoe and a whole division would have been needed to convoy the corps of prisoners and when our men were not always getting full rations and the prisoners already taken were perishing of hunger all the profound plans about cutting off and capturing napoleon and his army were like the plan of a market gardener who when driving out of his garden a cow that had trampled down the beds he had planted should run to the gate and hit the cow on the head the only thing to be said in excuse of that gardener would be that he was very angry but not even that could be said for those who drew up this project for it was not they who had suffered from the trampled beds but besides the fact that cutting off napoleon with his army would have been senseless it was impossible it was impossible first because
