rewarded the name of nicholas rostv awarded a st georges cross of the fourth class for courage shown in the ostrvna affair and in the same order the name of prince andrew bolknski appointed to the command of a regiment of chasseurs though he did not want to remind the rostvs of bolknski pierre could not refrain from making them happy by the news of their sons having received a decoration so he sent that printed army order and nicholas letter to the rostvs keeping the appeal the bulletin and the other orders to take with him when he went to dinner his conversation with count rostopchn and the latters tone of anxious hurry the meeting with the courier who talked casually of how badly things were going in the army the rumors of the discovery of spies in moscow and of a leaflet in circulation stating that napoleon promised to be in both the russian capitals by the autumn and the talk of the emperors being expected to arrive next day all aroused with fresh force that feeling of agitation and expectation in pierre which he had been conscious of ever since the appearance of the comet and especially since the beginning of the war he had long been thinking of entering the army and would have done so had he not been hindered first by his membership of the society of freemasons to which he was bound by oath and which preached perpetual peace and the abolition of war and secondly by the fact that when he saw the great mass of muscovites who had donned uniform and were talking patriotism he somehow felt ashamed to take the step but the chief reason for not carrying out his intention to enter the army lay in the vague idea that he was lrusse besuhof who had the number of the beast that his part in the great affair of setting a limit to the power of the beast that spoke great and blasphemous things had been predestined from eternity and that therefore he ought not to undertake anything but wait for what was bound to come to pass chapter xx a few intimate friends were dining with the rostvs that day as usual on sundays pierre came early so as to find them alone he had grown so stout this year that he would have been abnormal had he not been so tall so broad of limb and so strong that he carried his bulk with evident ease he went up the stairs puffing and muttering something his coachman did not even ask whether he was to wait he knew that when his master was at the rostvs he stayed till midnight the rostvs footman rushed eagerly forward to help him off with his cloak and take his hat and stick pierre from club habit always left both hat and stick in the anteroom the first person he saw in the house was natsha even before he saw her while taking off his cloak he heard her she was practicing solfa exercises in the music room he knew that she had not sung since her illness and so the sound of her voice surprised and delighted him he opened the door softly and saw her in the lilac dress she had worn at church walking about the room singing she had her back to him when he opened the door but when turning quickly she saw his broad surprised face she blushed and came rapidly up to him i want to try to sing again she said adding as if by way of excuse it is at least something to do thats capital how glad i am youve come i am so happy today she said with the old animation pierre had not seen in her for a long time you know nicholas has received a st georges cross i am so proud of him oh yes i sent that announcement but i dont want to interrupt you he added and was about to go to the drawing room natsha stopped him count is it wrong of me to sing she said blushing and fixing her eyes inquiringly on him no why should it be on the contrary but why do you ask me i dont know myself natsha answered quickly but i should not like to do anything you disapproved of i believe in you completely you dont know how important you are to me how much youve done for me she spoke rapidly and did not notice how pierre
