without further effort on the part of the russians it had to perish bleeding from the mortal wound it had received at borodin the direct consequence of the battle of borodin was napoleons senseless flight from moscow his retreat along the old smolnsk road the destruction of the invading army of five hundred thousand men and the downfall of napoleonic france on which at borodin for the first time the hand of an opponent of stronger spirit had been laid book eleven chapter i absolute continuity of motion is not comprehensible to the human mind laws of motion of any kind become comprehensible to man only when he examines arbitrarily selected elements of that motion but at the same time a large proportion of human error comes from the arbitrary division of continuous motion into discontinuous elements there is a well-known so-called sophism of the ancients consisting in this that achilles could never catch up with a tortoise he was following in spite of the fact that he traveled ten times as fast as the tortoise by the time achilles has covered the distance that separated him from the tortoise the tortoise has covered one tenth of that distance ahead of him when achilles has covered that tenth the tortoise has covered another one hundredth and so on forever this problem seemed to the ancients insoluble the absurd answer that achilles could never overtake the tortoise resulted from this that motion was arbitrarily divided into discontinuous elements whereas the motion both of achilles and of the tortoise was continuous by adopting smaller and smaller elements of motion we only approach a solution of the problem but never reach it only when we have admitted the conception of the infinitely small and the resulting geometrical progression with a common ratio of one tenth and have found the sum of this progression to infinity do we reach a solution of the problem a modern branch of mathematics having achieved the art of dealing with the infinitely small can now yield solutions in other more complex problems of motion which used to appear insoluble this modern branch of mathematics unknown to the ancients when dealing with problems of motion admits the conception of the infinitely small and so conforms to the chief condition of motion absolute continuity and thereby corrects the inevitable error which the human mind cannot avoid when it deals with separate elements of motion instead of examining continuous motion in seeking the laws of historical movement just the same thing happens the movement of humanity arising as it does from innumerable arbitrary human wills is continuous to understand the laws of this continuous movement is the aim of history but to arrive at these laws resulting from the sum of all those human wills mans mind postulates arbitrary and disconnected units the first method of history is to take an arbitrarily selected series of continuous events and examine it apart from others though there is and can be no beginning to any event for one event always flows uninterruptedly from another the second method is to consider the actions of some one man a king or a commander as equivalent to the sum of many individual wills whereas the sum of individual wills is never expressed by the activity of a single historic personage historical science in its endeavor to draw nearer to truth continually takes smaller and smaller units for examination but however small the units it takes we feel that to take any unit disconnected from others or to assume a beginning of any phenomenon or to say that the will of many men is expressed by the actions of any one historic personage is in itself false it needs no critical exertion to reduce utterly to dust any deductions drawn from history it is merely necessary to select some larger or smaller unit as the subject of observation as criticism has every right to do seeing that whatever unit history observes must always be arbitrarily selected only by taking infinitesimally small units for observation the differential of history that is the individual tendencies of men and attaining to the art of integrating them that is finding the sum of these infinitesimals can we hope to arrive at the laws of history the first fifteen years of the nineteenth century in europe present an extraordinary movement of millions of people men leave their customary pursuits hasten from one side of europe to the other plunder and slaughter one another triumph and are plunged in despair and for some years the
