the dancers boot was hanging loose what a fellow you are for dancing the dancer stopped pulled off the loose piece of leather and threw it on the fire right enough friend said he and having sat down took out of his knapsack a scrap of blue french cloth and wrapped it round his foot its the steam that spoils them he added stretching out his feet toward the fire theyll soon be issuing us new ones they say that when weve finished hammering them were to receive double kits and that son of a bitch petrv has lagged behind after all it seems said one sergeant major ive had an eye on him this long while said the other well hes a poor sort of soldier but in the third company they say nine men were missing yesterday yes its all very well but when a mans feet are frozen how can he walk eh dont talk nonsense said a sergeant major do you want to be doing the same said an old soldier turning reproachfully to the man who had spoken of frozen feet well you know said the sharp-nosed man they called jackdaw in a squeaky and unsteady voice raising himself at the other side of the fire a plump man gets thin but for a thin one its death take me now ive got no strength left he added with sudden resolution turning to the sergeant major tell them to send me to hospital im aching all over anyway i shant be able to keep up thatll do thatll do replied the sergeant major quietly the soldier said no more and the talk went on what a lot of those frenchies were taken today and the fact is that not one of them had what you might call real boots on said a soldier starting a new theme they were no more than make-believes the cossacks have taken their boots they were clearing the hut for the colonel and carried them out it was pitiful to see them boys put in the dancer as they turned them over one seemed still alive and would you believe it he jabbered something in their lingo but theyre a clean folk lads the first man went on he was white as white as birchbark and some of them are such fine fellows you might think they were nobles well what do you think they make soldiers of all classes there but they dont understand our talk at all said the dancer with a puzzled smile i asked him whose subject he was and he jabbered in his own way a queer lot but its strange friends continued the man who had wondered at their whiteness the peasants at mozhysk were saying that when they began burying the dead where the battle was you know well those dead had been lying there for nearly a month and says the peasant they lie as white as paper clean and not as much smell as a puff of powder smoke was it from the cold asked someone youre a clever fellow from the cold indeed why it was hot if it had been from the cold ours would not have rotted either but he says go up to ours and they are all rotten and maggoty so he says we tie our faces up with kerchiefs and turn our heads away as we drag them off we can hardly do it but theirs he says are white as paper and not so much smell as a whiff of gunpowder all were silent it must be from their food said the sergeant major they used to gobble the same food as the gentry no one contradicted him that peasant near mozhysk where the battle was said the men were all called up from ten villages around and they carted for twenty days and still didnt finish carting the dead away and as for the wolves he says that was a real battle said an old soldier its the only one worth remembering but since that its only been tormenting folk and do you know daddy the day before yesterday we ran at them and my word they didnt let us get near before they just threw down their muskets and went on their knees pardon they say thats only one case they say pltov took poleon himself twice but he didnt know the right charm he catches him and catches him no good he turns into a bird in his hands and flies away and
