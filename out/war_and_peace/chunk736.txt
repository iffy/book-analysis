it is irrevocably linked to the moment at which it was committed can i lift my arm i lift it but ask myself could i have abstained from lifting my arm at the moment that has already passed to convince myself of this i do not lift it the next moment but i am not now abstaining from doing so at the first moment when i asked the question time has gone by which i could not detain the arm i then lifted is no longer the same as the arm i now refrain from lifting nor is the air in which i lifted it the same that now surrounds me the moment in which the first movement was made is irrevocable and at that moment i could make only one movement and whatever movement i made would be the only one that i did not lift my arm a moment later does not prove that i could have abstained from lifting it then and since i could make only one movement at that single moment of time it could not have been any other to imagine it as free it is necessary to imagine it in the present on the boundary between the past and the future that is outside time which is impossible however much the difficulty of understanding the causes may be increased we never reach a conception of complete freedom that is an absence of cause however inaccessible to us may be the cause of the expression of will in any action our own or anothers the first demand of reason is the assumption of and search for a cause for without a cause no phenomenon is conceivable i raise my arm to perform an action independently of any cause but my wish to perform an action without a cause is the cause of my action but even if imagining a man quite exempt from all influences examining only his momentary action in the present unevoked by any cause we were to admit so infinitely small a remainder of inevitability as equaled zero we should even then not have arrived at the conception of complete freedom in man for a being uninfluenced by the external world standing outside of time and independent of cause is no longer a man in the same way we can never imagine the action of a man quite devoid of freedom and entirely subject to the law of inevitability however we may increase our knowledge of the conditions of space in which man is situated that knowledge can never be complete for the number of those conditions is as infinite as the infinity of space and therefore so long as not all the conditions influencing men are defined there is no complete inevitability but a certain measure of freedom remains however we may prolong the period of time between the action we are examining and the judgment upon it that period will be finite while time is infinite and so in this respect too there can never be absolute inevitability however accessible may be the chain of causation of any action we shall never know the whole chain since it is endless and so again we never reach absolute inevitability but besides this even if admitting the remaining minimum of freedom to equal zero we assumed in some given case as for instance in that of a dying man an unborn babe or an idiot complete absence of freedom by so doing we should destroy the very conception of man in the case we are examining for as soon as there is no freedom there is also no man and so the conception of the action of a man subject solely to the law of inevitability without any element of freedom is just as impossible as the conception of a mans completely free action and so to imagine the action of a man entirely subject to the law of inevitability without any freedom we must assume the knowledge of an infinite number of space relations an infinitely long period of time and an infinite series of causes to imagine a man perfectly free and not subject to the law of inevitability we must imagine him all alone beyond space beyond time and free from dependence on cause in the first case if inevitability were possible without freedom we should have reached a definition of inevitability by the laws of inevitability itself that is a mere form without content in the second case if freedom were possible without inevitability we should have arrived at
