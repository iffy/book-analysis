on all sides he acknowledged no acquaintances but saw in all these men only brothers and burned with impatience to set to work with them the grand master rapped with his mallet all the masons sat down in their places and one of them read an exhortation on the necessity of humility the grand master proposed that the last duty should be performed and the distinguished dignitary who bore the title of collector of alms went round to all the brothers pierre would have liked to subscribe all he had but fearing that it might look like pride subscribed the same amount as the others the meeting was at an end and on reaching home pierre felt as if he had returned from a long journey on which he had spent dozens of years had become completely changed and had quite left behind his former habits and way of life chapter v the day after he had been received into the lodge pierre was sitting at home reading a book and trying to fathom the significance of the square one side of which symbolized god another moral things a third physical things and the fourth a combination of these now and then his attention wandered from the book and the square and he formed in imagination a new plan of life on the previous evening at the lodge he had heard that a rumor of his duel had reached the emperor and that it would be wiser for him to leave petersburg pierre proposed going to his estates in the south and there attending to the welfare of his serfs he was joyfully planning this new life when prince vasli suddenly entered the room my dear fellow what have you been up to in moscow why have you quarreled with hlne mon cher you are under a delusion said prince vasli as he entered i know all about it and i can tell you positively that hlne is as innocent before you as christ was before the jews pierre was about to reply but prince vasli interrupted him and why didnt you simply come straight to me as to a friend i know all about it and understand it all he said you behaved as becomes a man who values his honor perhaps too hastily but we wont go into that but consider the position in which you are placing her and me in the eyes of society and even of the court he added lowering his voice she is living in moscow and you are here remember dear boy and he drew pierres arm downwards it is simply a misunderstanding i expect you feel it so yourself let us write her a letter at once and shell come here and all will be explained or else my dear boy let me tell you its quite likely youll have to suffer for it prince vasli gave pierre a significant look i know from reliable sources that the dowager empress is taking a keen interest in the whole affair you know she is very gracious to hlne pierre tried several times to speak but on one hand prince vasli did not let him and on the other pierre himself feared to begin to speak in the tone of decided refusal and disagreement in which he had firmly resolved to answer his father-in-law moreover the words of the masonic statutes be kindly and courteous recurred to him he blinked went red got up and sat down again struggling with himself to do what was for him the most difficult thing in life to say an unpleasant thing to a mans face to say what the other whoever he might be did not expect he was so used to submitting to prince vaslis tone of careless self-assurance that he felt he would be unable to withstand it now but he also felt that on what he said now his future depended whether he would follow the same old road or that new path so attractively shown him by the masons on which he firmly believed he would be reborn to a new life now dear boy said prince vasli playfully say yes and ill write to her myself and we will kill the fatted calf but before prince vasli had finished his playful speech pierre without looking at him and with a kind of fury that made him like his father muttered in a whisper prince i did not ask you here go please go and he jumped up and opened the door for him
