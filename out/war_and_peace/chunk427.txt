and only asked them to allay his grief yes let them have it replied prince andrew if you noticed some disorder in the garden said alptych it was impossible to prevent it three regiments have been here and spent the night dragoons mostly i took down the name and rank of their commanding officer to hand in a complaint about it well and what are you going to do will you stay here if the enemy occupies the place asked prince andrew alptych turned his face to prince andrew looked at him and suddenly with a solemn gesture raised his arm he is my refuge his will be done he exclaimed a group of bareheaded peasants was approaching across the meadow toward the prince well good-by said prince andrew bending over to alptych you must go away too take away what you can and tell the serfs to go to the ryazn estate or to the one near moscow alptych clung to prince andrews leg and burst into sobs gently disengaging himself the prince spurred his horse and rode down the avenue at a gallop the old man was still sitting in the ornamental garden like a fly impassive on the face of a loved one who is dead tapping the last on which he was making the bast shoe and two little girls running out from the hot house carrying in their skirts plums they had plucked from the trees there came upon prince andrew on seeing the young master the elder one with frightened look clutched her younger companion by the hand and hid with her behind a birch tree not stopping to pick up some green plums they had dropped prince andrew turned away with startled haste unwilling to let them see that they had been observed he was sorry for the pretty frightened little girl was afraid of looking at her and yet felt an irresistible desire to do so a new sensation of comfort and relief came over him when seeing these girls he realized the existence of other human interests entirely aloof from his own and just as legitimate as those that occupied him evidently these girls passionately desired one thing to carry away and eat those green plums without being caught and prince andrew shared their wish for the success of their enterprise he could not resist looking at them once more believing their danger past they sprang from their ambush and chirruping something in their shrill little voices and holding up their skirts their bare little sunburned feet scampered merrily and quickly across the meadow grass prince andrew was somewhat refreshed by having ridden off the dusty highroad along which the troops were moving but not far from bald hills he again came out on the road and overtook his regiment at its halting place by the dam of a small pond it was past one oclock the sun a red ball through the dust burned and scorched his back intolerably through his black coat the dust always hung motionless above the buzz of talk that came from the resting troops there was no wind as he crossed the dam prince andrew smelled the ooze and freshness of the pond he longed to get into that water however dirty it might be and he glanced round at the pool from whence came sounds of shrieks and laughter the small muddy green pond had risen visibly more than a foot flooding the dam because it was full of the naked white bodies of soldiers with brick-red hands necks and faces who were splashing about in it all this naked white human flesh laughing and shrieking floundered about in that dirty pool like carp stuffed into a watering can and the suggestion of merriment in that floundering mass rendered it specially pathetic one fair-haired young soldier of the third company whom prince andrew knew and who had a strap round the calf of one leg crossed himself stepped back to get a good run and plunged into the water another a dark noncommissioned officer who was always shaggy stood up to his waist in the water joyfully wriggling his muscular figure and snorted with satisfaction as he poured the water over his head with hands blackened to the wrists there were sounds of men slapping one another yelling and puffing everywhere on the bank on the dam and in the pond there was healthy white muscular flesh the officer timkhin with his red little nose standing on the dam wiping himself with a towel felt confused
