rode beside densov the pulsation of his body constantly increasing it was getting lighter and lighter but the mist still hid distant objects having reached the valley densov looked back and nodded to a cossack beside him the signal said he the cossack raised his arm and a shot rang out in an instant the tramp of horses galloping forward was heard shouts came from various sides and then more shots at the first sound of trampling hoofs and shouting ptya lashed his horse and loosening his rein galloped forward not heeding densov who shouted at him it seemed to ptya that at the moment the shot was fired it suddenly became as bright as noon he galloped to the bridge cossacks were galloping along the road in front of him on the bridge he collided with a cossack who had fallen behind but he galloped on in front of him soldiers probably frenchmen were running from right to left across the road one of them fell in the mud under his horses feet cossacks were crowding about a hut busy with something from the midst of that crowd terrible screams arose ptya galloped up and the first thing he saw was the pale face and trembling jaw of a frenchman clutching the handle of a lance that had been aimed at him hurrah lads ours shouted ptya and giving rein to his excited horse he galloped forward along the village street he could hear shooting ahead of him cossacks hussars and ragged russian prisoners who had come running from both sides of the road were shouting something loudly and incoherently a gallant-looking frenchman in a blue overcoat capless and with a frowning red face had been defending himself against the hussars when ptya galloped up the frenchman had already fallen too late again flashed through ptyas mind and he galloped on to the place from which the rapid firing could be heard the shots came from the yard of the landowners house he had visited the night before with dlokhov the french were making a stand there behind a wattle fence in a garden thickly overgrown with bushes and were firing at the cossacks who crowded at the gateway through the smoke as he approached the gate ptya saw dlokhov whose face was of a pale-greenish tint shouting to his men go round wait for the infantry he exclaimed as ptya rode up to him wait hurrah-ah-ah shouted ptya and without pausing a moment galloped to the place whence came the sounds of firing and where the smoke was thickest a volley was heard and some bullets whistled past while others plashed against something the cossacks and dlokhov galloped after ptya into the gateway of the courtyard in the dense wavering smoke some of the french threw down their arms and ran out of the bushes to meet the cossacks while others ran down the hill toward the pond ptya was galloping along the courtyard but instead of holding the reins he waved both his arms about rapidly and strangely slipping farther and farther to one side in his saddle his horse having galloped up to a campfire that was smoldering in the morning light stopped suddenly and ptya fell heavily on to the wet ground the cossacks saw that his arms and legs jerked rapidly though his head was quite motionless a bullet had pierced his skull after speaking to the senior french officer who came out of the house with a white handkerchief tied to his sword and announced that they surrendered dlokhov dismounted and went up to ptya who lay motionless with outstretched arms done for he said with a frown and went to the gate to meet densov who was riding toward him killed cried densov recognizing from a distance the unmistakably lifeless attitude very familiar to him in which ptyas body was lying done for repeated dlokhov as if the utterance of these words afforded him pleasure and he went quickly up to the prisoners who were surrounded by cossacks who had hurried up we wont take them he called out to densov densov did not reply he rode up to ptya dismounted and with trembling hands turned toward himself the bloodstained mud-bespattered face which had already gone white i am used to something sweet raisins fine ones take them all he recalled ptyas words and the cossacks looked round in surprise at the sound like the yelp of a dog with which densov turned away walked to the wattle fence and seized hold of it
