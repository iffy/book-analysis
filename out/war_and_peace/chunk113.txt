so dark that one could not distinguish the uniforms ten paces off and the firing had begun to subside suddenly near by on the right shouting and firing were again heard flashes of shot gleamed in the darkness this was the last french attack and was met by soldiers who had sheltered in the village houses they all rushed out of the village again but tshins guns could not move and the artillerymen tshin and the cadet exchanged silent glances as they awaited their fate the firing died down and soldiers talking eagerly streamed out of a side street not hurt petrv asked one weve given it em hot mate they wont make another push now said another you couldnt see a thing how they shot at their own fellows nothing could be seen pitch-dark brother isnt there something to drink the french had been repulsed for the last time and again and again in the complete darkness tshins guns moved forward surrounded by the humming infantry as by a frame in the darkness it seemed as though a gloomy unseen river was flowing always in one direction humming with whispers and talk and the sound of hoofs and wheels amid the general rumble the groans and voices of the wounded were more distinctly heard than any other sound in the darkness of the night the gloom that enveloped the army was filled with their groans which seemed to melt into one with the darkness of the night after a while the moving mass became agitated someone rode past on a white horse followed by his suite and said something in passing what did he say where to now halt is it did he thank us came eager questions from all sides the whole moving mass began pressing closer together and a report spread that they were ordered to halt evidently those in front had halted all remained where they were in the middle of the muddy road fires were lighted and the talk became more audible captain tshin having given orders to his company sent a soldier to find a dressing station or a doctor for the cadet and sat down by a bonfire the soldiers had kindled on the road rostv too dragged himself to the fire from pain cold and damp a feverish shivering shook his whole body drowsiness was irresistibly mastering him but he kept awake by an excruciating pain in his arm for which he could find no satisfactory position he kept closing his eyes and then again looking at the fire which seemed to him dazzlingly red and at the feeble round-shouldered figure of tshin who was sitting cross-legged like a turk beside him tshins large kind intelligent eyes were fixed with sympathy and commiseration on rostv who saw that tshin with his whole heart wished to help him but could not from all sides were heard the footsteps and talk of the infantry who were walking driving past and settling down all around the sound of voices the tramping feet the horses hoofs moving in mud the crackling of wood fires near and afar merged into one tremulous rumble it was no longer as before a dark unseen river flowing through the gloom but a dark sea swelling and gradually subsiding after a storm rostv looked at and listened listlessly to what passed before and around him an infantryman came to the fire squatted on his heels held his hands to the blaze and turned away his face you dont mind your honor he asked tshin ive lost my company your honor i dont know where such bad luck with the soldier an infantry officer with a bandaged cheek came up to the bonfire and addressing tshin asked him to have the guns moved a trifle to let a wagon go past after he had gone two soldiers rushed to the campfire they were quarreling and fighting desperately each trying to snatch from the other a boot they were both holding on to you picked it up i dare say youre very smart one of them shouted hoarsely then a thin pale soldier his neck bandaged with a bloodstained leg band came up and in angry tones asked the artillerymen for water must one die like a dog said he tshin told them to give the man some water then a cheerful soldier ran up begging a little fire for the infantry a nice little hot torch for the infantry good luck to you fellow countrymen thanks for the fire well return it with interest
