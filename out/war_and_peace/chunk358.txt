be so in love with him as to agree to run away with him was something pierre could not conceive and could not imagine he could not reconcile the charming impression he had of natsha whom he had known from a child with this new conception of her baseness folly and cruelty he thought of his wife they are all alike he said to himself reflecting that he was not the only man unfortunate enough to be tied to a bad woman but still he pitied prince andrew to the point of tears and sympathized with his wounded pride and the more he pitied his friend the more did he think with contempt and even with disgust of that natsha who had just passed him in the ballroom with such a look of cold dignity he did not know that natshas soul was overflowing with despair shame and humiliation and that it was not her fault that her face happened to assume an expression of calm dignity and severity but how get married said pierre in answer to mrya dmtrievna he could not marry he is married things get worse from hour to hour ejaculated mrya dmtrievna a nice youth what a scoundrel and shes expecting him expecting him since yesterday she must be told then at least she wont go on expecting him after hearing the details of anatoles marriage from pierre and giving vent to her anger against anatole in words of abuse mrya dmtrievna told pierre why she had sent for him she was afraid that the count or bolknski who might arrive at any moment if they knew of this affair which she hoped to hide from them might challenge anatole to a duel and she therefore asked pierre to tell his brother-in-law in her name to leave moscow and not dare to let her set eyes on him again pierre only now realizing the danger to the old count nicholas and prince andrew promised to do as she wished having briefly and exactly explained her wishes to him she let him go to the drawing room mind the count knows nothing behave as if you know nothing either she said and i will go and tell her it is no use expecting him and stay to dinner if you care to she called after pierre pierre met the old count who seemed nervous and upset that morning natsha had told him that she had rejected bolknski troubles troubles my dear fellow he said to pierre what troubles one has with these girls without their mother i do so regret having come here i will be frank with you have you heard she has broken off her engagement without consulting anybody its true this engagement never was much to my liking of course he is an excellent man but still with his fathers disapproval they wouldnt have been happy and natsha wont lack suitors still it has been going on so long and to take such a step without fathers or mothers consent and now shes ill and god knows what its hard count hard to manage daughters in their mothers absence pierre saw that the count was much upset and tried to change the subject but the count returned to his troubles snya entered the room with an agitated face natsha is not quite well shes in her room and would like to see you mrya dmtrievna is with her and she too asks you to come yes you are a great friend of bolknskis no doubt she wants to send him a message said the count oh dear oh dear how happy it all was and clutching the spare gray locks on his temples the count left the room when mrya dmtrievna told natsha that anatole was married natsha did not wish to believe it and insisted on having it confirmed by pierre himself snya told pierre this as she led him along the corridor to natshas room natsha pale and stern was sitting beside mrya dmtrievna and her eyes glittering feverishly met pierre with a questioning look the moment he entered she did not smile or nod but only gazed fixedly at him and her look asked only one thing was he a friend or like the others an enemy in regard to anatole as for pierre he evidently did not exist for her he knows all about it said mrya dmtrievna pointing to pierre and addressing natsha let him tell you whether i have told the truth natsha looked from one to the other
