written by learned men and so it is natural and agreeable for them to think that the activity of their class supplies the basis of the movement of all humanity just as a similar belief is natural and agreeable to traders agriculturists and soldiers if they do not express it that is merely because traders and soldiers do not write history and that spiritual activity enlightenment civilization culture ideas are all indistinct indefinite conceptions under whose banner it is very easy to use words having a still less definite meaning and which can therefore be readily introduced into any theory but not to speak of the intrinsic quality of histories of this kind which may possibly even be of use to someone for something the histories of culture to which all general histories tend more and more to approximate are significant from the fact that after seriously and minutely examining various religious philosophic and political doctrines as causes of events as soon as they have to describe an actual historic event such as the campaign of for instance they involuntarily describe it as resulting from an exercise of power and say plainly that that was the result of napoleons will speaking so the historians of culture involuntarily contradict themselves and show that the new force they have devised does not account for what happens in history and that history can only be explained by introducing a power which they apparently do not recognize chapter iii a locomotive is moving someone asks what moves it a peasant says the devil moves it another man says the locomotive moves because its wheels go round a third asserts that the cause of its movement lies in the smoke which the wind carries away the peasant is irrefutable he has devised a complete explanation to refute him someone would have to prove to him that there is no devil or another peasant would have to explain to him that it is not the devil but a german who moves the locomotive only then as a result of the contradiction will they see that they are both wrong but the man who says that the movement of the wheels is the cause refutes himself for having once begun to analyze he ought to go on and explain further why the wheels go round and till he has reached the ultimate cause of the movement of the locomotive in the pressure of steam in the boiler he has no right to stop in his search for the cause the man who explains the movement of the locomotive by the smoke that is carried back has noticed that the wheels do not supply an explanation and has taken the first sign that occurs to him and in his turn has offered that as an explanation the only conception that can explain the movement of the locomotive is that of a force commensurate with the movement observed the only conception that can explain the movement of the peoples is that of some force commensurate with the whole movement of the peoples yet to supply this conception various historians take forces of different kinds all of which are incommensurate with the movement observed some see it as a force directly inherent in heroes as the peasant sees the devil in the locomotive others as a force resulting from several other forces like the movement of the wheels others again as an intellectual influence like the smoke that is blown away so long as histories are written of separate individuals whether caesars alexanders luthers or voltaires and not the histories of all absolutely all those who take part in an event it is quite impossible to describe the movement of humanity without the conception of a force compelling men to direct their activity toward a certain end and the only such conception known to historians is that of power this conception is the one handle by means of which the material of history as at present expounded can be dealt with and anyone who breaks that handle off as buckle did without finding some other method of treating historical material merely deprives himself of the one possible way of dealing with it the necessity of the conception of power as an explanation of historical events is best demonstrated by the universal historians and historians of culture themselves for they professedly reject that conception but inevitably have recourse to it at every step in dealing with humanitys inquiry the science of history up to now is like money in circulation paper money and
