has the weakness of never agreeing with anything not generally accepted but i understand that you value what opens up a fresh line said she repeating words pierre had once uttered no the chief point is that to nicholas ideas and discussions are an amusement almost a pastime said pierre for instance he is collecting a library and has made it a rule not to buy a new book till he has read what he had already bought sismondi and rousseau and montesquieu he added with a smile you know how much i he began to soften down what he had said but natsha interrupted him to show that this was unnecessary so you say ideas are an amusement to him yes and for me nothing else is serious all the time in petersburg i saw everyone as in a dream when i am taken up by a thought all else is mere amusement ah im so sorry i wasnt there when you met the children said natsha which was most delighted lisa im sure yes pierre replied and went on with what was in his mind nicholas says we ought not to think but i cant help it besides when i was in petersburg i felt i can say this to you that the whole affair would go to pieces without me everyone was pulling his own way but i succeeded in uniting them all and then my idea is so clear and simple you see i dont say that we ought to oppose this and that we may be mistaken what i say is join hands you who love the right and let there be but one banner that of active virtue prince sergy is a fine fellow and clever natsha would have had no doubt as to the greatness of pierres idea but one thing disconcerted her can a man so important and necessary to society be also my husband how did this happen she wished to express this doubt to him now who could decide whether he is really cleverer than all the others she asked herself and passed in review all those whom pierre most respected judging by what he had said there was no one he had respected so highly as platn karatev do you know what i am thinking about she asked about platn karatev would he have approved of you now do you think pierre was not at all surprised at this question he understood his wifes line of thought platn karatev he repeated and pondered evidently sincerely trying to imagine karatevs opinion on the subject he would not have understood yet perhaps he would i love you awfully natsha suddenly said awfully awfully no he would not have approved said pierre after reflection what he would have approved of is our family life he was always so anxious to find seemliness happiness and peace in everything and i should have been proud to let him see us there now you talk of my absence but you wouldnt believe what a special feeling i have for you after a separation yes i should think natsha began no its not that i never leave off loving you and one couldnt love more but this is something special yes of course he did not finish because their eyes meeting said the rest what nonsense it is natsha suddenly exclaimed about honeymoons and that the greatest happiness is at first on the contrary now is the best of all if only you did not go away do you remember how we quarreled and it was always my fault always mine and what we quarreled about i dont even remember always about the same thing said pierre with a smile jealo dont say it i cant bear it natsha cried and her eyes glittered coldly and vindictively did you see her she added after a pause no and if i had i shouldnt have recognized her they were silent for a while oh do you know while you were talking in the study i was looking at you natsha began evidently anxious to disperse the cloud that had come over them you are as like him as two peas like the boy she meant her little son oh its time to go to him the milks come but im sorry to leave you they were silent for a few seconds then suddenly turning to one another at the same time they both began to speak pierre began with self-satisfaction and enthusiasm natsha with a quiet happy smile having
