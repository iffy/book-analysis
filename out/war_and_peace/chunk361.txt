better spirits than usual and awaited his son with great impatience some days after anatoles departure pierre received a note from prince andrew informing him of his arrival and asking him to come to see him as soon as he reached moscow prince andrew had received from his father natshas note to princess mary breaking off her engagement mademoiselle bourienne had purloined it from princess mary and given it to the old prince and he heard from him the story of natshas elopement with additions prince andrew had arrived in the evening and pierre came to see him next morning pierre expected to find prince andrew in almost the same state as natsha and was therefore surprised on entering the drawing room to hear him in the study talking in a loud animated voice about some intrigue going on in petersburg the old princes voice and another now and then interrupted him princess mary came out to meet pierre she sighed looking toward the door of the room where prince andrew was evidently intending to express her sympathy with his sorrow but pierre saw by her face that she was glad both at what had happened and at the way her brother had taken the news of natshas faithlessness he says he expected it she remarked i know his pride will not let him express his feelings but still he has taken it better far better than i expected evidently it had to be but is it possible that all is really ended asked pierre princess mary looked at him with astonishment she did not understand how he could ask such a question pierre went into the study prince andrew greatly changed and plainly in better health but with a fresh horizontal wrinkle between his brows stood in civilian dress facing his father and prince meshchrski warmly disputing and vigorously gesticulating the conversation was about spernski the news of whose sudden exile and alleged treachery had just reached moscow now he is censured and accused by all who were enthusiastic about him a month ago prince andrew was saying and by those who were unable to understand his aims to judge a man who is in disfavor and to throw on him all the blame of other mens mistakes is very easy but i maintain that if anything good has been accomplished in this reign it was done by him by him alone he paused at the sight of pierre his face quivered and immediately assumed a vindictive expression posterity will do him justice he concluded and at once turned to pierre well how are you still getting stouter he said with animation but the new wrinkle on his forehead deepened yes i am well he said in answer to pierres question and smiled to pierre that smile said plainly i am well but my health is now of no use to anyone after a few words to pierre about the awful roads from the polish frontier about people he had met in switzerland who knew pierre and about m dessalles whom he had brought from abroad to be his sons tutor prince andrew again joined warmly in the conversation about spernski which was still going on between the two old men if there were treason or proofs of secret relations with napoleon they would have been made public he said with warmth and haste i do not and never did like spernski personally but i like justice pierre now recognized in his friend a need with which he was only too familiar to get excited and to have arguments about extraneous matters in order to stifle thoughts that were too oppressive and too intimate when prince meshchrski had left prince andrew took pierres arm and asked him into the room that had been assigned him a bed had been made up there and some open portmanteaus and trunks stood about prince andrew went to one and took out a small casket from which he drew a packet wrapped in paper he did it all silently and very quickly he stood up and coughed his face was gloomy and his lips compressed forgive me for troubling you pierre saw that prince andrew was going to speak of natsha and his broad face expressed pity and sympathy this expression irritated prince andrew and in a determined ringing and unpleasant tone he continued i have received a refusal from countess rostva and have heard reports of your brother-in-law having sought her hand or something of that kind is that true both true and untrue
