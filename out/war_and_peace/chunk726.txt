rulers under conditions which they regard as known with this method of observation it often happens that the observer influenced by the direction he himself prefers regards those as leaders who owing to the peoples change of direction are no longer in front but on one side or even in the rear if the animals in front are continually changing and the direction of the whole herd is constantly altered this is because in order to follow a given direction the animals transfer their will to the animals that have attracted our attention and to study the movements of the herd we must watch the movements of all the prominent animals moving on all sides of the herd so say the third class of historians who regard all historical persons from monarchs to journalists as the expression of their age the theory of the transference of the will of the people to historic persons is merely a paraphrase a restatement of the question in other words what causes historical events power what is power power is the collective will of the people transferred to one person under what condition is the will of the people delegated to one person on condition that that person expresses the will of the whole people that is power is power in other words power is a word the meaning of which we do not understand if the realm of human knowledge were confined to abstract reasoning then having subjected to criticism the explanation of power that juridical science gives us humanity would conclude that power is merely a word and has no real existence but to understand phenomena man has besides abstract reasoning experience by which he verifies his reflections and experience tells us that power is not merely a word but an actually existing phenomenon not to speak of the fact that no description of the collective activity of men can do without the conception of power the existence of power is proved both by history and by observing contemporary events whenever an event occurs a man appears or men appear by whose will the event seems to have taken place napoleon iii issues a decree and the french go to mexico the king of prussia and bismarck issue decrees and an army enters bohemia napoleon i issues a decree and an army enters russia alexander i gives a command and the french submit to the bourbons experience shows us that whatever event occurs it is always related to the will of one or of several men who have decreed it the historians in accord with the old habit of acknowledging divine intervention in human affairs want to see the cause of events in the expression of the will of someone endowed with power but that supposition is not confirmed either by reason or by experience on the one side reflection shows that the expression of a mans will his words are only part of the general activity expressed in an event as for instance in a war or a revolution and so without assuming an incomprehensible supernatural force a miracle one cannot admit that words can be the immediate cause of the movements of millions of men on the other hand even if we admitted that words could be the cause of events history shows that the expression of the will of historical personages does not in most cases produce any effect that is to say their commands are often not executed and sometimes the very opposite of what they order occurs without admitting divine intervention in the affairs of humanity we cannot regard power as the cause of events power from the standpoint of experience is merely the relation that exists between the expression of someones will and the execution of that will by others to explain the conditions of that relationship we must first establish a conception of the expression of will referring it to man and not to the deity if the deity issues a command expresses his will as ancient history tells us the expression of that will is independent of time and is not caused by anything for the divinity is not controlled by an event but speaking of commands that are the expression of the will of men acting in time and in relation to one another to explain the connection of commands with events we must restore the condition of all that takes place the continuity of movement in time both of the events and of the person who commands and the inevitability of the connection between
