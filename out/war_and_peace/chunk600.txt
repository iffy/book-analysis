they ascribe the glory of that achievement of genius to different men and dispute as to whom the honor is due even foreign historians including the french acknowledge the genius of the russian commanders when they speak of that flank march but it is hard to understand why military writers and following them others consider this flank march to be the profound conception of some one man who saved russia and destroyed napoleon in the first place it is hard to understand where the profundity and genius of this movement lay for not much mental effort was needed to see that the best position for an army when it is not being attacked is where there are most provisions and even a dull boy of thirteen could have guessed that the best position for an army after its retreat from moscow in was on the kalga road so it is impossible to understand by what reasoning the historians reach the conclusion that this maneuver was a profound one and it is even more difficult to understand just why they think that this maneuver was calculated to save russia and destroy the french for this flank march had it been preceded accompanied or followed by other circumstances might have proved ruinous to the russians and salutary for the french if the position of the russian army really began to improve from the time of that march it does not at all follow that the march was the cause of it that flank march might not only have failed to give any advantage to the russian army but might in other circumstances have led to its destruction what would have happened had moscow not burned down if murat had not lost sight of the russians if napoleon had not remained inactive if the russian army at krsnaya pakhr had given battle as bennigsen and barclay advised what would have happened had the french attacked the russians while they were marching beyond the pakhr what would have happened if on approaching tartino napoleon had attacked the russians with but a tenth of the energy he had shown when he attacked them at smolnsk what would have happened had the french moved on petersburg in any of these eventualities the flank march that brought salvation might have proved disastrous the third and most incomprehensible thing is that people studying history deliberately avoid seeing that this flank march cannot be attributed to any one man that no one ever foresaw it and that in reality like the retreat from fil it did not suggest itself to anyone in its entirety but resulted moment by moment step by step event by event from an endless number of most diverse circumstances and was only seen in its entirety when it had been accomplished and belonged to the past at the council at fil the prevailing thought in the minds of the russian commanders was the one naturally suggesting itself namely a direct retreat by the nzhni road in proof of this there is the fact that the majority of the council voted for such a retreat and above all there is the well-known conversation after the council between the commander in chief and lansky who was in charge of the commissariat department lansky informed the commander in chief that the army supplies were for the most part stored along the ok in the tla and ryazn provinces and that if they retreated on nzhni the army would be separated from its supplies by the broad river ok which cannot be crossed early in winter this was the first indication of the necessity of deviating from what had previously seemed the most natural course a direct retreat on nzhni-nvgorod the army turned more to the south along the ryazn road and nearer to its supplies subsequently the inactivity of the french who even lost sight of the russian army concern for the safety of the arsenal at tla and especially the advantages of drawing nearer to its supplies caused the army to turn still further south to the tla road having crossed over by a forced march to the tla road beyond the pakhr the russian commanders intended to remain at podlsk and had no thought of the tartino position but innumerable circumstances and the reappearance of french troops who had for a time lost touch with the russians and projects of giving battle and above all the abundance of provisions in kalga province obliged our army to turn still more to the south and to cross from the tla
