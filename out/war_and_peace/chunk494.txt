grains that fell some crows scenting blood flew among the birch trees cawing impatiently around the tents over more than five acres bloodstained men in various garbs stood sat or lay around the wounded stood crowds of soldier stretcher-bearers with dismal and attentive faces whom the officers keeping order tried in vain to drive from the spot disregarding the officers orders the soldiers stood leaning against their stretchers and gazing intently as if trying to comprehend the difficult problem of what was taking place before them from the tents came now loud angry cries and now plaintive groans occasionally dressers ran out to fetch water or to point out those who were to be brought in next the wounded men awaiting their turn outside the tents groaned sighed wept screamed swore or asked for vodka some were delirious prince andrews bearers stepping over the wounded who had not yet been bandaged took him as a regimental commander close up to one of the tents and there stopped awaiting instructions prince andrew opened his eyes and for a long time could not make out what was going on around him he remembered the meadow the wormwood the field the whirling black ball and his sudden rush of passionate love of life two steps from him leaning against a branch and talking loudly and attracting general attention stood a tall handsome black-haired noncommissioned officer with a bandaged head he had been wounded in the head and leg by bullets around him eagerly listening to his talk a crowd of wounded and stretcher-bearers was gathered we kicked him out from there so that he chucked everything we grabbed the king himself cried he looking around him with eyes that glittered with fever if only reserves had come up just then lads there wouldnt have been nothing left of him i tell you surely like all the others near the speaker prince andrew looked at him with shining eyes and experienced a sense of comfort but isnt it all the same now thought he and what will be there and what has there been here why was i so reluctant to part with life there was something in this life i did not and do not understand chapter xxxvii one of the doctors came out of the tent in a bloodstained apron holding a cigar between the thumb and little finger of one of his small bloodstained hands so as not to smear it he raised his head and looked about him but above the level of the wounded men he evidently wanted a little respite after turning his head from right to left for some time he sighed and looked down all right immediately he replied to a dresser who pointed prince andrew out to him and he told them to carry him into the tent murmurs arose among the wounded who were waiting it seems that even in the next world only the gentry are to have a chance remarked one prince andrew was carried in and laid on a table that had only just been cleared and which a dresser was washing down prince andrew could not make out distinctly what was in that tent the pitiful groans from all sides and the torturing pain in his thigh stomach and back distracted him all he saw about him merged into a general impression of naked bleeding human bodies that seemed to fill the whole of the low tent as a few weeks previously on that hot august day such bodies had filled the dirty pond beside the smolnsk road yes it was the same flesh the same chair canon the sight of which had even then filled him with horror as by a presentiment there were three operating tables in the tent two were occupied and on the third they placed prince andrew for a little while he was left alone and involuntarily witnessed what was taking place on the other two tables on the nearest one sat a tartar probably a cossack judging by the uniform thrown down beside him four soldiers were holding him and a spectacled doctor was cutting into his muscular brown back ooh ooh ooh grunted the tartar and suddenly lifting up his swarthy snub-nosed face with its high cheekbones and baring his white teeth he began to wriggle and twitch his body and utter piercing ringing and prolonged yells on the other table round which many people were crowding a tall well-fed man lay on his back with his head thrown back his curly hair its color
