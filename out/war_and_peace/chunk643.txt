among the russian prisoners rescued by densov and dlokhov was pierre bezkhov chapter xii during the whole of their march from moscow no fresh orders had been issued by the french authorities concerning the party of prisoners among whom was pierre on the twenty-second of october that party was no longer with the same troops and baggage trains with which it had left moscow half the wagons laden with hardtack that had traveled the first stages with them had been captured by cossacks the other half had gone on ahead not one of those dismounted cavalrymen who had marched in front of the prisoners was left they had all disappeared the artillery the prisoners had seen in front of them during the first days was now replaced by marshal junots enormous baggage train convoyed by westphalians behind the prisoners came a cavalry baggage train from vyzma onwards the french army which had till then moved in three columns went on as a single group the symptoms of disorder that pierre had noticed at their first halting place after leaving moscow had now reached the utmost limit the road along which they moved was bordered on both sides by dead horses ragged men who had fallen behind from various regiments continually changed about now joining the moving column now again lagging behind it several times during the march false alarms had been given and the soldiers of the escort had raised their muskets fired and run headlong crushing one another but had afterwards reassembled and abused each other for their causeless panic these three groups traveling together the cavalry stores the convoy of prisoners and junots baggage train still constituted a separate and united whole though each of the groups was rapidly melting away of the artillery baggage train which had consisted of a hundred and twenty wagons not more than sixty now remained the rest had been captured or left behind some of junots wagons also had been captured or abandoned three wagons had been raided and robbed by stragglers from davouts corps from the talk of the germans pierre learned that a larger guard had been allotted to that baggage train than to the prisoners and that one of their comrades a german soldier had been shot by the marshals own order because a silver spoon belonging to the marshal had been found in his possession the group of prisoners had melted away most of all of the three hundred and thirty men who had set out from moscow fewer than a hundred now remained the prisoners were more burdensome to the escort than even the cavalry saddles or junots baggage they understood that the saddles and junots spoon might be of some use but that cold and hungry soldiers should have to stand and guard equally cold and hungry russians who froze and lagged behind on the road in which case the order was to shoot them was not merely incomprehensible but revolting and the escort as if afraid in the grievous condition they themselves were in of giving way to the pity they felt for the prisoners and so rendering their own plight still worse treated them with particular moroseness and severity at dorogobzh while the soldiers of the convoy after locking the prisoners in a stable had gone off to pillage their own stores several of the soldier prisoners tunneled under the wall and ran away but were recaptured by the french and shot the arrangement adopted when they started that the officer prisoners should be kept separate from the rest had long since been abandoned all who could walk went together and after the third stage pierre had rejoined karatev and the gray-blue bandy-legged dog that had chosen karatev for its master on the third day after leaving moscow karatev again fell ill with the fever he had suffered from in the hospital in moscow and as he grew gradually weaker pierre kept away from him pierre did not know why but since karatev had begun to grow weaker it had cost him an effort to go near him when he did so and heard the subdued moaning with which karatev generally lay down at the halting places and when he smelled the odor emanating from him which was now stronger than before pierre moved farther away and did not think about him while imprisoned in the shed pierre had learned not with his intellect but with his whole being by life itself that man is created for happiness that happiness is within him in the satisfaction
