and let me have this card and ill take my cap and drive home to supper with densov natsha and snya and will certainly never touch a card again at that moment his home life jokes with ptya talks with snya duets with natsha piquet with his father and even his comfortable bed in the house on the povarskya rose before him with such vividness clearness and charm that it seemed as if it were all a lost and unappreciated bliss long past he could not conceive that a stupid chance letting the seven be dealt to the right rather than to the left might deprive him of all this happiness newly appreciated and newly illumined and plunge him into the depths of unknown and undefined misery that could not be yet he awaited with a sinking heart the movement of dlokhovs hands those broad reddish hands with hairy wrists visible from under the shirt cuffs laid down the pack and took up a glass and a pipe that were handed him so you are not afraid to play with me repeated dlokhov and as if about to tell a good story he put down the cards leaned back in his chair and began deliberately with a smile yes gentlemen ive been told theres a rumor going about moscow that im a sharper so i advise you to be careful come now deal exclaimed rostv oh those moscow gossips said dlokhov and he took up the cards with a smile aah rostv almost screamed lifting both hands to his head the seven he needed was lying uppermost the first card in the pack he had lost more than he could pay still dont ruin yourself said dlokhov with a side glance at rostv as he continued to deal chapter xiv an hour and a half later most of the players were but little interested in their own play the whole interest was concentrated on rostv instead of sixteen hundred rubles he had a long column of figures scored against him which he had reckoned up to ten thousand but that now as he vaguely supposed must have risen to fifteen thousand in reality it already exceeded twenty thousand rubles dlokhov was no longer listening to stories or telling them but followed every movement of rostvs hands and occasionally ran his eyes over the score against him he had decided to play until that score reached forty-three thousand he had fixed on that number because forty-three was the sum of his and snyas joint ages rostv leaning his head on both hands sat at the table which was scrawled over with figures wet with spilled wine and littered with cards one tormenting impression did not leave him that those broad-boned reddish hands with hairy wrists visible from under the shirt sleeves those hands which he loved and hated held him in their power six hundred rubles ace a corner a nine winning it backs impossible oh how pleasant it was at home the knave double or quits it cant be and why is he doing this to me rostv pondered sometimes he staked a large sum but dlokhov refused to accept it and fixed the stake himself nicholas submitted to him and at one moment prayed to god as he had done on the battlefield at the bridge over the enns and then guessed that the card that came first to hand from the crumpled heap under the table would save him now counted the cords on his coat and took a card with that number and tried staking the total of his losses on it then he looked round for aid from the other players or peered at the now cold face of dlokhov and tried to read what was passing in his mind he knows of course what this loss means to me he cant want my ruin wasnt he my friend wasnt i fond of him but its not his fault whats he to do if he has such luck and its not my fault either he thought to himself i have done nothing wrong have i killed anyone or insulted or wished harm to anyone why such a terrible misfortune and when did it begin such a little while ago i came to this table with the thought of winning a hundred rubles to buy that casket for mammas name day and then going home i was so happy so free so lighthearted and i did not realize how happy i was when did that end and when did
