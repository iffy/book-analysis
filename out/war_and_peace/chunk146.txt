my duty i would not talk to you for a moment was listening to an old russian general with decorations who stood very erect almost on tiptoe with a soldiers obsequious expression on his purple face reporting something very well then be so good as to wait said prince andrew to the general in russian speaking with the french intonation he affected when he wished to speak contemptuously and noticing bors prince andrew paying no more heed to the general who ran after him imploring him to hear something more nodded and turned to him with a cheerful smile at that moment bors clearly realized what he had before surmised that in the army besides the subordination and discipline prescribed in the military code which he and the others knew in the regiment there was another more important subordination which made this tight-laced purple-faced general wait respectfully while captain prince andrew for his own pleasure chose to chat with lieutenant drubetsky more than ever was bors resolved to serve in future not according to the written code but under this unwritten law he felt now that merely by having been recommended to prince andrew he had already risen above the general who at the front had the power to annihilate him a lieutenant of the guards prince andrew came up to him and took his hand i am very sorry you did not find me in yesterday i was fussing about with germans all day we went with weyrother to survey the dispositions when germans start being accurate theres no end to it bors smiled as if he understood what prince andrew was alluding to as something generally known but it was the first time he had heard weyrothers name or even the term dispositions well my dear fellow so you still want to be an adjutant i have been thinking about you yes i was thinking for some reason bors could not help blushing of asking the commander in chief he has had a letter from prince kurgin about me i only wanted to ask because i fear the guards wont be in action he added as if in apology all right all right well talk it over replied prince andrew only let me report this gentlemans business and i shall be at your disposal while prince andrew went to report about the purple-faced general that gentleman evidently not sharing bors conception of the advantages of the unwritten code of subordination looked so fixedly at the presumptuous lieutenant who had prevented his finishing what he had to say to the adjutant that bors felt uncomfortable he turned away and waited impatiently for prince andrews return from the commander in chiefs room you see my dear fellow i have been thinking about you said prince andrew when they had gone into the large room where the clavichord was its no use your going to the commander in chief he would say a lot of pleasant things ask you to dinner that would not be bad as regards the unwritten code thought bors but nothing more would come of it there will soon be a battalion of us aides-de-camp and adjutants but this is what well do i have a good friend an adjutant general and an excellent fellow prince dolgorkov and though you may not know it the fact is that now kutzov with his staff and all of us count for nothing everything is now centered round the emperor so we will go to dolgorkov i have to go there anyhow and i have already spoken to him about you we shall see whether he cannot attach you to himself or find a place for you somewhere nearer the sun prince andrew always became specially keen when he had to guide a young man and help him to worldly success under cover of obtaining help of this kind for another which from pride he would never accept for himself he kept in touch with the circle which confers success and which attracted him he very readily took up bors cause and went with him to dolgorkov it was late in the evening when they entered the palace at olmtz occupied by the emperors and their retinues that same day a council of war had been held in which all the members of the hofkriegsrath and both emperors took part at that council contrary to the views of the old generals kutzov and prince schwartzenberg it had been decided to advance immediately and give battle to bonaparte the council of war was
