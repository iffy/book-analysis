of an old maidservant saying straight straight along the path miss only dont look back i am not afraid answered snyas voice and along the path toward nicholas came the crunching whistling sound of snyas feet in her thin shoes snya came along wrapped in her cloak she was only a couple of paces away when she saw him and to her too he was not the nicholas she had known and always slightly feared he was in a womans dress with tousled hair and a happy smile new to snya she ran rapidly toward him quite different and yet the same thought nicholas looking at her face all lit up by the moonlight he slipped his arms under the cloak that covered her head embraced her pressed her to him and kissed her on the lips that wore a mustache and had a smell of burnt cork snya kissed him full on the lips and disengaging her little hands pressed them to his cheeks snya nicholas was all they said they ran to the barn and then back again re-entering he by the front and she by the back porch chapter xii when they all drove back from pelagya danlovnas natsha who always saw and noticed everything arranged that she and madame schoss should go back in the sleigh with dimmler and snya with nicholas and the maids on the way back nicholas drove at a steady pace instead of racing and kept peering by that fantastic all-transforming light into snyas face and searching beneath the eyebrows and mustache for his former and his present snya from whom he had resolved never to be parted again he looked and recognizing in her both the old and the new snya and being reminded by the smell of burnt cork of the sensation of her kiss inhaled the frosty air with a full breast and looking at the ground flying beneath him and at the sparkling sky felt himself again in fairyland snya is it well with thee he asked from time to time yes she replied and with thee when halfway home nicholas handed the reins to the coachman and ran for a moment to natshas sleigh and stood on its wing natsha he whispered in french do you know i have made up my mind about snya have you told her asked natsha suddenly beaming all over with joy oh how strange you are with that mustache and those eyebrows natsha are you glad i am so glad so glad i was beginning to be vexed with you i did not tell you but you have been treating her badly what a heart she has nicholas i am horrid sometimes but i was ashamed to be happy while snya was not continued natsha now i am so glad well run back to her no wait a bit oh how funny you look cried nicholas peering into her face and finding in his sister too something new unusual and bewitchingly tender that he had not seen in her before natsha its magical isnt it yes she replied you have done splendidly had i seen her before as she is now thought nicholas i should long ago have asked her what to do and have done whatever she told me and all would have been well so you are glad and i have done right oh quite right i had a quarrel with mamma some time ago about it mamma said she was angling for you how could she say such a thing i nearly stormed at mamma i will never let anyone say anything bad of snya for there is nothing but good in her then its all right said nicholas again scrutinizing the expression of his sisters face to see if she was in earnest then he jumped down and his boots scrunching the snow ran back to his sleigh the same happy smiling circassian with mustache and beaming eyes looking up from under a sable hood was still sitting there and that circassian was snya and that snya was certainly his future happy and loving wife when they reached home and had told their mother how they had spent the evening at the melyukvs the girls went to their bedroom when they had undressed but without washing off the cork mustaches they sat a long time talking of their happiness they talked of how they would live when they were married how their husbands would be friends and how happy they would be on natshas table stood two looking glasses
