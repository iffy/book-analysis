since he had joined the active army and taken part in the battle of vyzma ptya had been in a constant state of blissful excitement at being grown-up and in a perpetual ecstatic hurry not to miss any chance to do something really heroic he was highly delighted with what he saw and experienced in the army but at the same time it always seemed to him that the really heroic exploits were being performed just where he did not happen to be and he was always in a hurry to get where he was not when on the twenty-first of october his general expressed a wish to send somebody to densovs detachment ptya begged so piteously to be sent that the general could not refuse but when dispatching him he recalled ptyas mad action at the battle of vyzma where instead of riding by the road to the place to which he had been sent he had galloped to the advanced line under the fire of the french and had there twice fired his pistol so now the general explicitly forbade his taking part in any action whatever of densovs that was why ptya had blushed and grown confused when densov asked him whether he could stay before they had ridden to the outskirts of the forest ptya had considered he must carry out his instructions strictly and return at once but when he saw the french and saw tkhon and learned that there would certainly be an attack that night he decided with the rapidity with which young people change their views that the general whom he had greatly respected till then was a rubbishy german that densov was a hero the esaul a hero and tkhon a hero too and that it would be shameful for him to leave them at a moment of difficulty it was already growing dusk when densov ptya and the esaul rode up to the watchhouse in the twilight saddled horses could be seen and cossacks and hussars who had rigged up rough shelters in the glade and were kindling glowing fires in a hollow of the forest where the french could not see the smoke in the passage of the small watchhouse a cossack with sleeves rolled up was chopping some mutton in the room three officers of densovs band were converting a door into a tabletop ptya took off his wet clothes gave them to be dried and at once began helping the officers to fix up the dinner table in ten minutes the table was ready and a napkin spread on it on the table were vodka a flask of rum white bread roast mutton and salt sitting at table with the officers and tearing the fat savory mutton with his hands down which the grease trickled ptya was in an ecstatic childish state of love for all men and consequently of confidence that others loved him in the same way so then what do you think vasli dmtrich said he to densov its all right my staying a day with you and not waiting for a reply he answered his own question you see i was told to find out well i am finding out only do let me into the very into the chief i dont want a reward but i want ptya clenched his teeth and looked around throwing back his head and flourishing his arms into the vewy chief densov repeated with a smile only please let me command something so that i may really command ptya went on what would it be to you oh you want a knife he said turning to an officer who wished to cut himself a piece of mutton and he handed him his clasp knife the officer admired it please keep it i have several like it said ptya blushing heavens i was quite forgetting he suddenly cried i have some raisins fine ones you know seedless ones we have a new sutler and he has such capital things i bought ten pounds i am used to something sweet would you like some and ptya ran out into the passage to his cossack and brought back some bags which contained about five pounds of raisins have some gentlemen have some you want a coffeepot dont you he asked the esaul i bought a capital one from our sutler he has splendid things and hes very honest thats the chief thing ill be sure to send it to you or perhaps your flints are giving out or are worn out that
