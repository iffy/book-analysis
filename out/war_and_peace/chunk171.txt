domestic serf in a peaked cap and sheepskin coat tit i say tit said the groom what answered the old man absent-mindedly go tit thresh a bit oh you fool said the old man spitting angrily some time passed in silence and then the same joke was repeated before five in the evening the battle had been lost at all points more than a hundred cannon were already in the hands of the french przebyszwski and his corps had laid down their arms other columns after losing half their men were retreating in disorderly confused masses the remains of langerons and dokhtrovs mingled forces were crowding around the dams and banks of the ponds near the village of augesd after five oclock it was only at the augesd dam that a hot cannonade delivered by the french alone was still to be heard from numerous batteries ranged on the slopes of the pratzen heights directed at our retreating forces in the rearguard dokhtrov and others rallying some battalions kept up a musketry fire at the french cavalry that was pursuing our troops it was growing dusk on the narrow augesd dam where for so many years the old miller had been accustomed to sit in his tasseled cap peacefully angling while his grandson with shirt sleeves rolled up handled the floundering silvery fish in the watering can on that dam over which for so many years moravians in shaggy caps and blue jackets had peacefully driven their two-horse carts loaded with wheat and had returned dusty with flour whitening their carts on that narrow dam amid the wagons and the cannon under the horses hoofs and between the wagon wheels men disfigured by fear of death now crowded together crushing one another dying stepping over the dying and killing one another only to move on a few steps and be killed themselves in the same way every ten seconds a cannon ball flew compressing the air around or a shell burst in the midst of that dense throng killing some and splashing with blood those near them dlokhov now an officer wounded in the arm and on foot with the regimental commander on horseback and some ten men of his company represented all that was left of that whole regiment impelled by the crowd they had got wedged in at the approach to the dam and jammed in on all sides had stopped because a horse in front had fallen under a cannon and the crowd were dragging it out a cannon ball killed someone behind them another fell in front and splashed dlokhov with blood the crowd pushing forward desperately squeezed together moved a few steps and again stopped move on a hundred yards and we are certainly saved remain here another two minutes and it is certain death thought each one dlokhov who was in the midst of the crowd forced his way to the edge of the dam throwing two soldiers off their feet and ran onto the slippery ice that covered the millpool turn this way he shouted jumping over the ice which creaked under him turn this way he shouted to those with the gun it bears the ice bore him but it swayed and creaked and it was plain that it would give way not only under a cannon or a crowd but very soon even under his weight alone the men looked at him and pressed to the bank hesitating to step onto the ice the general on horseback at the entrance to the dam raised his hand and opened his mouth to address dlokhov suddenly a cannon ball hissed so low above the crowd that everyone ducked it flopped into something moist and the general fell from his horse in a pool of blood nobody gave him a look or thought of raising him get onto the ice over the ice go on turn dont you hear go on innumerable voices suddenly shouted after the ball had struck the general the men themselves not knowing what or why they were shouting one of the hindmost guns that was going onto the dam turned off onto the ice crowds of soldiers from the dam began running onto the frozen pond the ice gave way under one of the foremost soldiers and one leg slipped into the water he tried to right himself but fell in up to his waist the nearest soldiers shrank back the gun driver stopped his horse but from behind still came the shouts onto the ice why do you stop go
