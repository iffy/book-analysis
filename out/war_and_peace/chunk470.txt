and that is why he is unsuitable he is unsuitable now just because he plans out everything very thoroughly and accurately as every german has to how can i explain well say your father has a german valet and he is a splendid valet and satisfies your fathers requirements better than you could then its all right to let him serve but if your father is mortally sick youll send the valet away and attend to your father with your own unpracticed awkward hands and will soothe him better than a skilled man who is a stranger could so it has been with barclay while russia was well a foreigner could serve her and be a splendid minister but as soon as she is in danger she needs one of her own kin but in your club they have been making him out a traitor they slander him as a traitor and the only result will be that afterwards ashamed of their false accusations they will make him out a hero or a genius instead of a traitor and that will be still more unjust he is an honest and very punctilious german and they say hes a skillful commander rejoined pierre i dont understand what is meant by a skillful commander replied prince andrew ironically a skillful commander replied pierre why one who foresees all contingencies and foresees the adversarys intentions but thats impossible said prince andrew as if it were a matter settled long ago pierre looked at him in surprise and yet they say that war is like a game of chess he remarked yes replied prince andrew but with this little difference that in chess you may think over each move as long as you please and are not limited for time and with this difference too that a knight is always stronger than a pawn and two pawns are always stronger than one while in war a battalion is sometimes stronger than a division and sometimes weaker than a company the relative strength of bodies of troops can never be known to anyone believe me he went on if things depended on arrangements made by the staff i should be there making arrangements but instead of that i have the honor to serve here in the regiment with these gentlemen and i consider that on us tomorrows battle will depend and not on those others success never depends and never will depend on position or equipment or even on numbers and least of all on position but on what then on the feeling that is in me and in him he pointed to timkhin and in each soldier prince andrew glanced at timkhin who looked at his commander in alarm and bewilderment in contrast to his former reticent taciturnity prince andrew now seemed excited he could apparently not refrain from expressing the thoughts that had suddenly occurred to him a battle is won by those who firmly resolve to win it why did we lose the battle at austerlitz the french losses were almost equal to ours but very early we said to ourselves that we were losing the battle and we did lose it and we said so because we had nothing to fight for there we wanted to get away from the battlefield as soon as we could weve lost so let us run and we ran if we had not said that till the evening heaven knows what might not have happened but tomorrow we shant say it you talk about our position the left flank weak and the right flank too extended he went on thats all nonsense theres nothing of the kind but what awaits us tomorrow a hundred million most diverse chances which will be decided on the instant by the fact that our men or theirs run or do not run and that this man or that man is killed but all that is being done at present is only play the fact is that those men with whom you have ridden round the position not only do not help matters but hinder they are only concerned with their own petty interests at such a moment said pierre reproachfully at such a moment prince andrew repeated to them it is only a moment affording opportunities to undermine a rival and obtain an extra cross or ribbon for me tomorrow means this a russian army of a hundred thousand and a french army of a hundred thousand have met to fight and the thing is that these two hundred thousand men
