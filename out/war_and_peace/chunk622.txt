and firm appearance well what is it from whom he asked immediately but without hurry blinking at the light while listening to the officers report konovntsyn broke the seal and read the dispatch hardly had he done so before he lowered his legs in their woolen stockings to the earthen floor and began putting on his boots then he took off his nightcap combed his hair over his temples and donned his cap did you get here quickly let us go to his highness konovntsyn had understood at once that the news brought was of great importance and that no time must be lost he did not consider or ask himself whether the news was good or bad that did not interest him he regarded the whole business of the war not with his intelligence or his reason but by something else there was within him a deep unexpressed conviction that all would be well but that one must not trust to this and still less speak about it but must only attend to ones own work and he did his work giving his whole strength to the task peter petrvich konovntsyn like dokhtrov seems to have been included merely for proprietys sake in the list of the so-called heroes of the barclays ravskis ermlovs pltovs and milordoviches like dokhtrov he had the reputation of being a man of very limited capacity and information and like dokhtrov he never made plans of battle but was always found where the situation was most difficult since his appointment as general on duty he had always slept with his door open giving orders that every messenger should be allowed to wake him up in battle he was always under fire so that kutzov reproved him for it and feared to send him to the front and like dokhtrov he was one of those unnoticed cogwheels that without clatter or noise constitute the most essential part of the machine coming out of the hut into the damp dark night konovntsyn frowned partly from an increased pain in his head and partly at the unpleasant thought that occurred to him of how all that nest of influential men on the staff would be stirred up by this news especially bennigsen who ever since tartino had been at daggers drawn with kutzov and how they would make suggestions quarrel issue orders and rescind them and this premonition was disagreeable to him though he knew it could not be helped and in fact toll to whom he went to communicate the news immediately began to expound his plans to a general sharing his quarters until konovntsyn who listened in weary silence reminded him that they must go to see his highness chapter xvii kutzov like all old people did not sleep much at night he often fell asleep unexpectedly in the daytime but at night lying on his bed without undressing he generally remained awake thinking so he lay now on his bed supporting his large heavy scarred head on his plump hand with his one eye open meditating and peering into the darkness since bennigsen who corresponded with the emperor and had more influence than anyone else on the staff had begun to avoid him kutzov was more at ease as to the possibility of himself and his troops being obliged to take part in useless aggressive movements the lesson of the tartino battle and of the day before it which kutzov remembered with pain must he thought have some effect on others too they must understand that we can only lose by taking the offensive patience and time are my warriors my champions thought kutzov he knew that an apple should not be plucked while it is green it will fall of itself when ripe but if picked unripe the apple is spoiled the tree is harmed and your teeth are set on edge like an experienced sportsman he knew that the beast was wounded and wounded as only the whole strength of russia could have wounded it but whether it was mortally wounded or not was still an undecided question now by the fact of lauriston and barthlemi having been sent and by the reports of the guerrillas kutzov was almost sure that the wound was mortal but he needed further proofs and it was necessary to wait they want to run to see how they have wounded it wait and we shall see continual maneuvers continual advances thought he what for only to distinguish themselves as if fighting were fun they are like children from
