and sat down beside him you are unhappy my dear sir the stranger continued you are young and i am old i should like to help you as far as lies in my power oh yes said pierre with a forced smile i am very grateful to you where are you traveling from the strangers face was not genial it was even cold and severe but in spite of this both the face and words of his new acquaintance were irresistibly attractive to pierre but if for any reason you dont feel inclined to talk to me said the old man say so my dear sir and he suddenly smiled in an unexpected and tenderly paternal way oh no not at all on the contrary i am very glad to make your acquaintance said pierre and again glancing at the strangers hands he looked more closely at the ring with its skull a masonic sign allow me to ask he said are you a mason yes i belong to the brotherhood of the freemasons said the stranger looking deeper and deeper into pierres eyes and in their name and my own i hold out a brotherly hand to you i am afraid said pierre smiling and wavering between the confidence the personality of the freemason inspired in him and his own habit of ridiculing the masonic beliefs i am afraid i am very far from understanding how am i to put it i am afraid my way of looking at the world is so opposed to yours that we shall not understand one another i know your outlook said the mason and the view of life you mention and which you think is the result of your own mental efforts is the one held by the majority of people and is the invariable fruit of pride indolence and ignorance forgive me my dear sir but if i had not known it i should not have addressed you your view of life is a regrettable delusion just as i may suppose you to be deluded said pierre with a faint smile i should never dare to say that i know the truth said the mason whose words struck pierre more and more by their precision and firmness no one can attain to truth by himself only by laying stone on stone with the cooperation of all by the millions of generations from our forefather adam to our own times is that temple reared which is to be a worthy dwelling place of the great god he added and closed his eyes i ought to tell you that i do not believe do not believe in god said pierre regretfully and with an effort feeling it essential to speak the whole truth the mason looked intently at pierre and smiled as a rich man with millions in hand might smile at a poor fellow who told him that he poor man had not the five rubles that would make him happy yes you do not know him my dear sir said the mason you cannot know him you do not know him and that is why you are unhappy yes yes i am unhappy assented pierre but what am i to do you know him not my dear sir and so you are very unhappy you do not know him but he is here he is in me he is in my words he is in thee and even in those blasphemous words thou hast just uttered pronounced the mason in a stern and tremulous voice he paused and sighed evidently trying to calm himself if he were not he said quietly you and i would not be speaking of him my dear sir of what of whom are we speaking whom hast thou denied he suddenly asked with exulting austerity and authority in his voice who invented him if he did not exist whence came thy conception of the existence of such an incomprehensible being didst thou and why did the whole world conceive the idea of the existence of such an incomprehensible being a being all-powerful eternal and infinite in all his attributes he stopped and remained silent for a long time pierre could not and did not wish to break this silence he exists but to understand him is hard the mason began again looking not at pierre but straight before him and turning the leaves of his book with his old hands which from excitement he could not keep still if it were a man whose existence thou didst doubt
