consequently the valet who omitted to bring napoleon his waterproof boots on the twenty-fourth would have been the savior of russia along that line of thought such a deduction is indubitable as indubitable as the deduction voltaire made in jest without knowing what he was jesting at when he saw that the massacre of st bartholomew was due to charles ixs stomach being deranged but to men who do not admit that russia was formed by the will of one man peter i or that the french empire was formed and the war with russia begun by the will of one man napoleon that argument seems not merely untrue and irrational but contrary to all human reality to the question of what causes historic events another answer presents itself namely that the course of human events is predetermined from on high depends on the coincidence of the wills of all who take part in the events and that a napoleons influence on the course of these events is purely external and fictitious strange as at first glance it may seem to suppose that the massacre of st bartholomew was not due to charles ixs will though he gave the order for it and thought it was done as a result of that order and strange as it may seem to suppose that the slaughter of eighty thousand men at borodin was not due to napoleons will though he ordered the commencement and conduct of the battle and thought it was done because he ordered it strange as these suppositions appear yet human dignity which tells me that each of us is if not more at least not less a man than the great napoleon demands the acceptance of that solution of the question and historic investigation abundantly confirms it at the battle of borodin napoleon shot at no one and killed no one that was all done by the soldiers therefore it was not he who killed people the french soldiers went to kill and be killed at the battle of borodin not because of napoleons orders but by their own volition the whole army french italian german polish and dutch hungry ragged and weary of the campaign felt at the sight of an army blocking their road to moscow that the wine was drawn and must be drunk had napoleon then forbidden them to fight the russians they would have killed him and have proceeded to fight the russians because it was inevitable when they heard napoleons proclamation offering them as compensation for mutilation and death the words of posterity about their having been in the battle before moscow they cried vive lempereur just as they had cried vive lempereur at the sight of the portrait of the boy piercing the terrestrial globe with a toy stick and just as they would have cried vive lempereur at any nonsense that might be told them there was nothing left for them to do but cry vive lempereur and go to fight in order to get food and rest as conquerors in moscow so it was not because of napoleons commands that they killed their fellow men and it was not napoleon who directed the course of the battle for none of his orders were executed and during the battle he did not know what was going on before him so the way in which these people killed one another was not decided by napoleons will but occurred independently of him in accord with the will of hundreds of thousands of people who took part in the common action it only seemed to napoleon that it all took place by his will and so the question whether he had or had not a cold has no more historic interest than the cold of the least of the transport soldiers moreover the assertion made by various writers that his cold was the cause of his dispositions not being as well-planned as on former occasions and of his orders during the battle not being as good as previously is quite baseless which again shows that napoleons cold on the twenty-sixth of august was unimportant the dispositions cited above are not at all worse but are even better than previous dispositions by which he had won victories his pseudo-orders during the battle were also no worse than formerly but much the same as usual these dispositions and orders only seem worse than previous ones because the battle of borodin was the first napoleon did not win the profoundest and most excellent dispositions and orders seem very
