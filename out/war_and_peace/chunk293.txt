dressed in coarse rags walking with a staff a wallet on her back along the dusty road directing her wanderings from one saints shrine to another free from envy earthly love or desire and reaching at last the place where there is no more sorrow or sighing but eternal joy and bliss i shall come to a place and pray there and before having time to get used to it or getting to love it i shall go farther i will go on till my legs fail and ill lie down and die somewhere and shall at last reach that eternal quiet haven where there is neither sorrow nor sighing thought princess mary but afterwards when she saw her father and especially little koko nicholas her resolve weakened she wept quietly and felt that she was a sinner who loved her father and little nephew more than god book seven chapter i the bible legend tells us that the absence of labor idleness was a condition of the first mans blessedness before the fall fallen man has retained a love of idleness but the curse weighs on the race not only because we have to seek our bread in the sweat of our brows but because our moral nature is such that we cannot be both idle and at ease an inner voice tells us we are in the wrong if we are idle if man could find a state in which he felt that though idle he was fulfilling his duty he would have found one of the conditions of mans primitive blessedness and such a state of obligatory and irreproachable idleness is the lot of a whole class the military the chief attraction of military service has consisted and will consist in this compulsory and irreproachable idleness nicholas rostv experienced this blissful condition to the full when after he continued to serve in the pvlograd regiment in which he already commanded the squadron he had taken over from densov rostv had become a bluff good-natured fellow whom his moscow acquaintances would have considered rather bad form but who was liked and respected by his comrades subordinates and superiors and was well contented with his life of late in he found in letters from home more frequent complaints from his mother that their affairs were falling into greater and greater disorder and that it was time for him to come back to gladden and comfort his old parents reading these letters nicholas felt a dread of their wanting to take him away from surroundings in which protected from all the entanglements of life he was living so calmly and quietly he felt that sooner or later he would have to re-enter that whirlpool of life with its embarrassments and affairs to be straightened out its accounts with stewards quarrels and intrigues its ties society and with snyas love and his promise to her it was all dreadfully difficult and complicated and he replied to his mother in cold formal letters in french beginning my dear mamma and ending your obedient son which said nothing of when he would return in he received letters from his parents in which they told him of natshas engagement to bolknski and that the wedding would be in a years time because the old prince made difficulties this letter grieved and mortified nicholas in the first place he was sorry that natsha for whom he cared more than for anyone else in the family should be lost to the home and secondly from his hussar point of view he regretted not to have been there to show that fellow bolknski that connection with him was no such great honor after all and that if he loved natsha he might dispense with permission from his dotard father for a moment he hesitated whether he should not apply for leave in order to see natsha before she was married but then came the maneuvers and considerations about snya and about the confusion of their affairs and nicholas again put it off but in the spring of that year he received a letter from his mother written without his fathers knowledge and that letter persuaded him to return she wrote that if he did not come and take matters in hand their whole property would be sold by auction and they would all have to go begging the count was so weak and trusted mtenka so much and was so good-natured that everybody took advantage of him and things were going from bad to worse for gods sake i
