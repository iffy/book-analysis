suddenly flushed crimson and for a long time tried not to look at natsha when he ventured to glance her way again her face was cold stern and he fancied even contemptuous and did you really see and speak to napoleon as we have been told said princess mary pierre laughed no not once everybody seems to imagine that being taken prisoner means being napoleons guest not only did i never see him but i heard nothing about him i was in much lower company supper was over and pierre who at first declined to speak about his captivity was gradually led on to do so but its true that you remained in moscow to kill napoleon natsha asked with a slight smile i guessed it then when we met at the skharev tower do you remember pierre admitted that it was true and from that was gradually led by princess marys questions and especially by natshas into giving a detailed account of his adventures at first he spoke with the amused and mild irony now customary with him toward everybody and especially toward himself but when he came to describe the horrors and sufferings he had witnessed he was unconsciously carried away and began speaking with the suppressed emotion of a man re-experiencing in recollection strong impressions he has lived through princess mary with a gentle smile looked now at pierre and now at natsha in the whole narrative she saw only pierre and his goodness natsha leaning on her elbow the expression of her face constantly changing with the narrative watched pierre with an attention that never wandered evidently herself experiencing all that he described not only her look but her exclamations and the brief questions she put showed pierre that she understood just what he wished to convey it was clear that she understood not only what he said but also what he wished to but could not express in words the account pierre gave of the incident with the child and the woman for protecting whom he was arrested was this it was an awful sight children abandoned some in the flames one was snatched out before my eyes and there were women who had their things snatched off and their earrings torn out he flushed and grew confused then a patrol arrived and all the men all those who were not looting that is were arrested and i among them i am sure youre not telling us everything i am sure you did something said natsha and pausing added something fine pierre continued when he spoke of the execution he wanted to pass over the horrible details but natsha insisted that he should not omit anything pierre began to tell about karatev but paused by this time he had risen from the table and was pacing the room natsha following him with her eyes then he added no you cant understand what i learned from that illiterate man that simple fellow yes yes go on said natsha where is he they killed him almost before my eyes and pierre his voice trembling continually went on to tell of the last days of their retreat of karatevs illness and his death he told of his adventures as he had never yet recalled them he now as it were saw a new meaning in all he had gone through now that he was telling it all to natsha he experienced that pleasure which a man has when women listen to him not clever women who when listening either try to remember what they hear to enrich their minds and when opportunity offers to retell it or who wish to adopt it to some thought of their own and promptly contribute their own clever comments prepared in their little mental workshop but the pleasure given by real women gifted with a capacity to select and absorb the very best a man shows of himself natsha without knowing it was all attention she did not lose a word no single quiver in pierres voice no look no twitch of a muscle in his face nor a single gesture she caught the unfinished word in its flight and took it straight into her open heart divining the secret meaning of all pierres mental travail princess mary understood his story and sympathized with him but she now saw something else that absorbed all her attention she saw the possibility of love and happiness between natsha and pierre and the first thought of this filled her heart with gladness it was three oclock in
