not in any way seek her approval he merely studied her with interest formerly she had felt that he regarded her with indifference and irony and so had shrunk into herself as she did with others and had shown him only the combative side of her nature but now he seemed to be trying to understand the most intimate places of her heart and mistrustfully at first but afterwards gratefully she let him see the hidden kindly sides of her character the most cunning man could not have crept into her confidence more successfully evoking memories of the best times of her youth and showing sympathy with them yet pierres cunning consisted simply in finding pleasure in drawing out the human qualities of the embittered hard and in her own way proud princess yes he is a very very kind man when he is not under the influence of bad people but of people such as myself thought she his servants too ternty and vska in their own way noticed the change that had taken place in pierre they considered that he had become much simpler ternty when he had helped him undress and wished him good night often lingered with his masters boots in his hands and clothes over his arm to see whether he would not start a talk and pierre noticing that ternty wanted a chat generally kept him there well tell me now how did you get food he would ask and ternty would begin talking of the destruction of moscow and of the old count and would stand for a long time holding the clothes and talking or sometimes listening to pierres stories and then would go out into the hall with a pleasant sense of intimacy with his master and affection for him the doctor who attended pierre and visited him every day though he considered it his duty as a doctor to pose as a man whose every moment was of value to suffering humanity would sit for hours with pierre telling him his favorite anecdotes and his observations on the characters of his patients in general and especially of the ladies its a pleasure to talk to a man like that he is not like our provincials he would say there were several prisoners from the french army in orl and the doctor brought one of them a young italian to see pierre this officer began visiting pierre and the princess used to make fun of the tenderness the italian expressed for him the italian seemed happy only when he could come to see pierre talk with him tell him about his past his life at home and his love and pour out to him his indignation against the french and especially against napoleon if all russians are in the least like you it is sacrilege to fight such a nation he said to pierre you who have suffered so from the french do not even feel animosity toward them pierre had evoked the passionate affection of the italian merely by evoking the best side of his nature and taking a pleasure in so doing during the last days of pierres stay in orl his old masonic acquaintance count willarski who had introduced him to the lodge in came to see him willarski was married to a russian heiress who had a large estate in orl province and he occupied a temporary post in the commissariat department in that town hearing that bezkhov was in orl willarski though they had never been intimate came to him with the professions of friendship and intimacy that people who meet in a desert generally express for one another willarski felt dull in orl and was pleased to meet a man of his own circle and as he supposed of similar interests but to his surprise willarski soon noticed that pierre had lagged much behind the times and had sunk as he expressed it to himself into apathy and egotism you are letting yourself go my dear fellow he said but for all that willarski found it pleasanter now than it had been formerly to be with pierre and came to see him every day to pierre as he looked at and listened to willarski it seemed strange to think that he had been like that himself but a short time before willarski was a married man with a family busy with his family affairs his wifes affairs and his official duties he regarded all these occupations as hindrances to life and considered that they were all contemptible
