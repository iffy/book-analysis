his entry into moscow before noon pierre did not allow himself to reflect on what lay before him but hastened to act after arranging his clothes he took the pistol and was about to go out but it then occurred to him for the first time that he certainly could not carry the weapon in his hand through the streets it was difficult to hide such a big pistol even under his wide coat he could not carry it unnoticed in his belt or under his arm besides it had been discharged and he had not had time to reload it no matter the dagger will do he said to himself though when planning his design he had more than once come to the conclusion that the chief mistake made by the student in had been to try to kill napoleon with a dagger but as his chief aim consisted not in carrying out his design but in proving to himself that he would not abandon his intention and was doing all he could to achieve it pierre hastily took the blunt jagged dagger in a green sheath which he had bought at the skharev market with the pistol and hid it under his waistcoat having tied a girdle over his coat and pulled his cap low on his head pierre went down the corridor trying to avoid making a noise or meeting the captain and passed out into the street the conflagration at which he had looked with so much indifference the evening before had greatly increased during the night moscow was on fire in several places the buildings in carriage row across the river in the bazaar and the povarsky as well as the barges on the moskv river and the timber yards by the dorogomlov bridge were all ablaze pierres way led through side streets to the povarsky and from there to the church of st nicholas on the arbt where he had long before decided that the deed should be done the gates of most of the houses were locked and the shutters up the streets and lanes were deserted the air was full of smoke and the smell of burning now and then he met russians with anxious and timid faces and frenchmen with an air not of the city but of the camp walking in the middle of the streets both the russians and the french looked at pierre with surprise besides his height and stoutness and the strange morose look of suffering in his face and whole figure the russians stared at pierre because they could not make out to what class he could belong the french followed him with astonishment in their eyes chiefly because pierre unlike all the other russians who gazed at the french with fear and curiosity paid no attention to them at the gate of one house three frenchmen who were explaining something to some russians who did not understand them stopped pierre asking if he did not know french pierre shook his head and went on in another side street a sentinel standing beside a green caisson shouted at him but only when the shout was threateningly repeated and he heard the click of the mans musket as he raised it did pierre understand that he had to pass on the other side of the street he heard nothing and saw nothing of what went on around him he carried his resolution within himself in terror and haste like something dreadful and alien to him for after the previous nights experience he was afraid of losing it but he was not destined to bring his mood safely to his destination and even had he not been hindered by anything on the way his intention could not now have been carried out for napoleon had passed the arbt more than four hours previously on his way from the dorogomlov suburb to the krmlin and was now sitting in a very gloomy frame of mind in a royal study in the krmlin giving detailed and exact orders as to measures to be taken immediately to extinguish the fire to prevent looting and to reassure the inhabitants but pierre did not know this he was entirely absorbed in what lay before him and was tortured as those are who obstinately undertake a task that is impossible for them not because of its difficulty but because of its incompatibility with their natures by the fear of weakening at the decisive moment and so losing his self-esteem though he heard and saw nothing around
