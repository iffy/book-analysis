to the veranda and smiled under his mustache and winked so joyfully when warm steady rain began to fall on the dry and thirsty shoots of the young oats or why when the wind carried away a threatening cloud during the hay harvest he would return from the barn flushed sunburned and perspiring with a smell of wormwood and gentian in his hair and gleefully rubbing his hands would say well one more day and my grain and the peasants will all be under cover still less did she understand why he kindhearted and always ready to anticipate her wishes should become almost desperate when she brought him a petition from some peasant men or women who had appealed to her to be excused some work why he that kind nicholas should obstinately refuse her angrily asking her not to interfere in what was not her business she felt he had a world apart which he loved passionately and which had laws she had not fathomed sometimes when trying to understand him she spoke of the good work he was doing for his serfs he would be vexed and reply not in the least it never entered my head and i wouldnt do that for their good thats all poetry and old wives talk all that doing good to ones neighbor what i want is that our children should not have to go begging i must put our affairs in order while i am alive thats all and to do that order and strictness are essential thats all about it said he clenching his vigorous fist and fairness of course he added for if the peasant is naked and hungry and has only one miserable horse he can do no good either for himself or for me and all nicholas did was fruitful probably just because he refused to allow himself to think that he was doing good to others for virtues sake his means increased rapidly serfs from neighboring estates came to beg him to buy them and long after his death the memory of his administration was devoutly preserved among the serfs he was a master the peasants affairs first and then his own of course he was not to be trifled with either in a word he was a real master chapter viii one matter connected with his management sometimes worried nicholas and that was his quick temper together with his old hussar habit of making free use of his fists at first he saw nothing reprehensible in this but in the second year of his marriage his view of that form of punishment suddenly changed once in summer he had sent for the village elder from boguchrovo a man who had succeeded to the post when dron died and who was accused of dishonesty and various irregularities nicholas went out into the porch to question him and immediately after the elder had given a few replies the sound of cries and blows were heard on returning to lunch nicholas went up to his wife who sat with her head bent low over her embroidery frame and as usual began to tell her what he had been doing that morning among other things he spoke of the boguchrovo elder countess mary turned red and then pale but continued to sit with head bowed and lips compressed and gave her husband no reply such an insolent scoundrel he cried growing hot again at the mere recollection of him if he had told me he was drunk and did not see but what is the matter with you mary he suddenly asked countess mary raised her head and tried to speak but hastily looked down again and her lips puckered why whatever is the matter my dearest the looks of the plain countess mary always improved when she was in tears she never cried from pain or vexation but always from sorrow or pity and when she wept her radiant eyes acquired an irresistible charm the moment nicholas took her hand she could no longer restrain herself and began to cry nicholas i saw it he was to blame but why do you nicholas and she covered her face with her hands nicholas said nothing he flushed crimson left her side and paced up and down the room he understood what she was weeping about but could not in his heart at once agree with her that what he had regarded from childhood as quite an everyday event was wrong is it just sentimentality old wives tales or is she right
