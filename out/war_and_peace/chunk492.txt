regiment having already lost more than two hundred men was moved forward into a trampled oatfield in the gap between semnovsk and the knoll battery where thousands of men perished that day and on which an intense concentrated fire from several hundred enemy guns was directed between one and two oclock without moving from that spot or firing a single shot the regiment here lost another third of its men from in front and especially from the right in the unlifting smoke the guns boomed and out of the mysterious domain of smoke that overlay the whole space in front quick hissing cannon balls and slow whistling shells flew unceasingly at times as if to allow them a respite a quarter of an hour passed during which the cannon balls and shells all flew overhead but sometimes several men were torn from the regiment in a minute and the slain were continually being dragged away and the wounded carried off with each fresh blow less and less chance of life remained for those not yet killed the regiment stood in columns of battalion three hundred paces apart but nevertheless the men were always in one and the same mood all alike were taciturn and morose talk was rarely heard in the ranks and it ceased altogether every time the thud of a successful shot and the cry of stretchers was heard most of the time by their officers order the men sat on the ground one having taken off his shako carefully loosened the gathers of its lining and drew them tight again another rubbing some dry clay between his palms polished his bayonet another fingered the strap and pulled the buckle of his bandolier while another smoothed and refolded his leg bands and put his boots on again some built little houses of the tufts in the plowed ground or plaited baskets from the straw in the cornfield all seemed fully absorbed in these pursuits when men were killed or wounded when rows of stretchers went past when some troops retreated and when great masses of the enemy came into view through the smoke no one paid any attention to these things but when our artillery or cavalry advanced or some of our infantry were seen to move forward words of approval were heard on all sides but the liveliest attention was attracted by occurrences quite apart from and unconnected with the battle it was as if the minds of these morally exhausted men found relief in everyday commonplace occurrences a battery of artillery was passing in front of the regiment the horse of an ammunition cart put its leg over a trace hey look at the trace horse get her leg out shell fall ah they dont see it came identical shouts from the ranks all along the regiment another time general attention was attracted by a small brown dog coming heaven knows whence which trotted in a preoccupied manner in front of the ranks with tail stiffly erect till suddenly a shell fell close by when it yelped tucked its tail between its legs and darted aside yells and shrieks of laughter rose from the whole regiment but such distractions lasted only a moment and for eight hours the men had been inactive without food in constant fear of death and their pale and gloomy faces grew ever paler and gloomier prince andrew pale and gloomy like everyone in the regiment paced up and down from the border of one patch to another at the edge of the meadow beside an oatfield with head bowed and arms behind his back there was nothing for him to do and no orders to be given everything went on of itself the killed were dragged from the front the wounded carried away and the ranks closed up if any soldiers ran to the rear they returned immediately and hastily at first prince andrew considering it his duty to rouse the courage of the men and to set them an example walked about among the ranks but he soon became convinced that this was unnecessary and that there was nothing he could teach them all the powers of his soul as of every soldier there were unconsciously bent on avoiding the contemplation of the horrors of their situation he walked along the meadow dragging his feet rustling the grass and gazing at the dust that covered his boots now he took big strides trying to keep to the footprints left on the meadow by the mowers then he counted his steps calculating how
