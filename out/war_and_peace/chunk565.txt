with joy pierre ran to the little girl and was going to take her in his arms but seeing a stranger the sickly scrofulous-looking child unattractively like her mother began to yell and run away pierre however seized her and lifted her in his arms she screamed desperately and angrily and tried with her little hands to pull pierres hands away and to bite them with her slobbering mouth pierre was seized by a sense of horror and repulsion such as he had experienced when touching some nasty little animal but he made an effort not to throw the child down and ran with her to the large house it was now however impossible to get back the way he had come the maid anska was no longer there and pierre with a feeling of pity and disgust pressed the wet painfully sobbing child to himself as tenderly as he could and ran with her through the garden seeking another way out chapter xxxiv having run through different yards and side streets pierre got back with his little burden to the gruznski garden at the corner of the povarsky he did not at first recognize the place from which he had set out to look for the child so crowded was it now with people and goods that had been dragged out of the houses besides russian families who had taken refuge here from the fire with their belongings there were several french soldiers in a variety of clothing pierre took no notice of them he hurried to find the family of that civil servant in order to restore the daughter to her mother and go to save someone else pierre felt that he had still much to do and to do quickly glowing with the heat and from running he felt at that moment more strongly than ever the sense of youth animation and determination that had come on him when he ran to save the child she had now become quiet and clinging with her little hands to pierres coat sat on his arm gazing about her like some little wild animal he glanced at her occasionally with a slight smile he fancied he saw something pathetically innocent in that frightened sickly little face he did not find the civil servant or his wife where he had left them he walked among the crowd with rapid steps scanning the various faces he met involuntarily he noticed a georgian or armenian family consisting of a very handsome old man of oriental type wearing a new cloth-covered sheepskin coat and new boots an old woman of similar type and a young woman that very young woman seemed to pierre the perfection of oriental beauty with her sharply outlined arched black eyebrows and the extraordinarily soft bright color of her long beautiful expressionless face amid the scattered property and the crowd on the open space she in her rich satin cloak with a bright lilac shawl on her head suggested a delicate exotic plant thrown out onto the snow she was sitting on some bundles a little behind the old woman and looked from under her long lashes with motionless large almond-shaped eyes at the ground before her evidently she was aware of her beauty and fearful because of it her face struck pierre and hurrying along by the fence he turned several times to look at her when he had reached the fence still without finding those he sought he stopped and looked about him with the child in his arms his figure was now more conspicuous than before and a group of russians both men and women gathered about him have you lost anyone my dear fellow youre of the gentry yourself arent you whose child is it they asked him pierre replied that the child belonged to a woman in a black coat who had been sitting there with her other children and he asked whether anyone knew where she had gone why that must be the anfrovs said an old deacon addressing a pockmarked peasant woman lord have mercy lord have mercy he added in his customary bass the anfrovs no said the woman they left in the morning that must be either mary nikolevnas or the ivnovs he says a woman and mary nikolevna is a lady remarked a house serf do you know her shes thin with long teeth said pierre thats mary nikolevna they went inside the garden when these wolves swooped down said the woman pointing to the french soldiers o lord have mercy added
