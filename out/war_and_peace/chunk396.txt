no thats not it something else resembling remorse tormented him yes oh yes that french officer with the dimple and i remember how my arm paused when i raised it rostv saw the prisoners being led away and galloped after them to have a look at his frenchman with the dimple on his chin he was sitting in his foreign uniform on an hussar packhorse and looked anxiously about him the sword cut on his arm could scarcely be called a wound he glanced at rostv with a feigned smile and waved his hand in greeting rostv still had the same indefinite feeling as of shame all that day and the next his friends and comrades noticed that rostv without being dull or angry was silent thoughtful and preoccupied he drank reluctantly tried to remain alone and kept turning something over in his mind rostv was always thinking about that brilliant exploit of his which to his amazement had gained him the st georges cross and even given him a reputation for bravery and there was something he could not at all understand so others are even more afraid than i am he thought so thats all there is in what is called heroism and did i do it for my countrys sake and how was he to blame with his dimple and blue eyes and how frightened he was he thought that i should kill him why should i kill him my hand trembled and they have given me a st georges cross i cant make it out at all but while nicholas was considering these questions and still could reach no clear solution of what puzzled him so the wheel of fortune in the service as often happens turned in his favor after the affair at ostrvna he was brought into notice received command of an hussar battalion and when a brave officer was needed he was chosen chapter xvi on receiving news of natshas illness the countess though not quite well yet and still weak went to moscow with ptya and the rest of the household and the whole family moved from mrya dmtrievnas house to their own and settled down in town natshas illness was so serious that fortunately for her and for her parents the consideration of all that had caused the illness her conduct and the breaking off of her engagement receded into the background she was so ill that it was impossible for them to consider in how far she was to blame for what had happened she could not eat or sleep grew visibly thinner coughed and as the doctors made them feel was in danger they could not think of anything but how to help her doctors came to see her singly and in consultation talked much in french german and latin blamed one another and prescribed a great variety of medicines for all the diseases known to them but the simple idea never occurred to any of them that they could not know the disease natsha was suffering from as no disease suffered by a live man can be known for every living person has his own peculiarities and always has his own peculiar personal novel complicated disease unknown to medicine not a disease of the lungs liver skin heart nerves and so on mentioned in medical books but a disease consisting of one of the innumerable combinations of the maladies of those organs this simple thought could not occur to the doctors as it cannot occur to a wizard that he is unable to work his charms because the business of their lives was to cure and they received money for it and had spent the best years of their lives on that business but above all that thought was kept out of their minds by the fact that they saw they were really useful as in fact they were to the whole rostv family their usefulness did not depend on making the patient swallow substances for the most part harmful the harm was scarcely perceptible as they were given in small doses but they were useful necessary and indispensable because they satisfied a mental need of the invalid and of those who loved her and that is why there are and always will be pseudo-healers wise women homeopaths and allopaths they satisfied that eternal human need for hope of relief for sympathy and that something should be done which is felt by those who are suffering they satisfied the need seen in its most elementary form in a child when
