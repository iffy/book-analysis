present a very distinguished dignitary and a swiss who had formerly been tutor at the kurgins all maintained a solemn silence listening to the words of the president who held a mallet in his hand let into the wall was a star-shaped light at one side of the table was a small carpet with various figures worked upon it at the other was something resembling an altar on which lay a testament and a skull round it stood seven large candlesticks like those used in churches two of the brothers led pierre up to the altar placed his feet at right angles and bade him lie down saying that he must prostrate himself at the gates of the temple he must first receive the trowel whispered one of the brothers oh hush please said another pierre perplexed looked round with his shortsighted eyes without obeying and suddenly doubts arose in his mind where am i what am i doing arent they laughing at me shant i be ashamed to remember this but these doubts only lasted a moment pierre glanced at the serious faces of those around remembered all he had already gone through and realized that he could not stop halfway he was aghast at his hesitation and trying to arouse his former devotional feeling prostrated himself before the gates of the temple and really the feeling of devotion returned to him even more strongly than before when he had lain there some time he was told to get up and a white leather apron such as the others wore was put on him he was given a trowel and three pairs of gloves and then the grand master addressed him he told him that he should try to do nothing to stain the whiteness of that apron which symbolized strength and purity then of the unexplained trowel he told him to toil with it to cleanse his own heart from vice and indulgently to smooth with it the heart of his neighbor as to the first pair of gloves a mans he said that pierre could not know their meaning but must keep them the second pair of mans gloves he was to wear at the meetings and finally of the third a pair of womens gloves he said dear brother these womans gloves are intended for you too give them to the woman whom you shall honor most of all this gift will be a pledge of your purity of heart to her whom you select to be your worthy helpmeet in masonry and after a pause he added but beware dear brother that these gloves do not deck hands that are unclean while the grand master said these last words it seemed to pierre that he grew embarrassed pierre himself grew still more confused blushed like a child till tears came to his eyes began looking about him uneasily and an awkward pause followed this silence was broken by one of the brethren who led pierre up to the rug and began reading to him from a manuscript book an explanation of all the figures on it the sun the moon a hammer a plumb line a trowel a rough stone and a squared stone a pillar three windows and so on then a place was assigned to pierre he was shown the signs of the lodge told the password and at last was permitted to sit down the grand master began reading the statutes they were very long and pierre from joy agitation and embarrassment was not in a state to understand what was being read he managed to follow only the last words of the statutes and these remained in his mind in our temples we recognize no other distinctions read the grand master but those between virtue and vice beware of making any distinctions which may infringe equality fly to a brothers aid whoever he may be exhort him who goeth astray raise him that falleth never bear malice or enmity toward thy brother be kindly and courteous kindle in all hearts the flame of virtue share thy happiness with thy neighbor and may envy never dim the purity of that bliss forgive thy enemy do not avenge thyself except by doing him good thus fulfilling the highest law thou shalt regain traces of the ancient dignity which thou hast lost he finished and getting up embraced and kissed pierre who with tears of joy in his eyes looked round him not knowing how to answer the congratulations and greetings from acquaintances that met him
