body and of the necessity of physical rest on the twenty-ninth of november kutzov entered vlna his dear vlna as he called it twice during his career kutzov had been governor of vlna in that wealthy town which had not been injured he found old friends and associations besides the comforts of life of which he had so long been deprived and he suddenly turned from the cares of army and state and as far as the passions that seethed around him allowed immersed himself in the quiet life to which he had formerly been accustomed as if all that was taking place and all that had still to be done in the realm of history did not concern him at all chichagv one of the most zealous cutters-off and breakers-up who had first wanted to effect a diversion in greece and then in warsaw but never wished to go where he was sent chichagv noted for the boldness with which he spoke to the emperor and who considered kutzov to be under an obligation to him because when he was sent to make peace with turkey in independently of kutzov and found that peace had already been concluded he admitted to the emperor that the merit of securing that peace was really kutzovs this chichagv was the first to meet kutzov at the castle where the latter was to stay in undress naval uniform with a dirk and holding his cap under his arm he handed kutzov a garrison report and the keys of the town the contemptuously respectful attitude of the younger men to the old man in his dotage was expressed in the highest degree by the behavior of chichagv who knew of the accusations that were being directed against kutzov when speaking to chichagv kutzov incidentally mentioned that the vehicles packed with china that had been captured from him at borsov had been recovered and would be restored to him you mean to imply that i have nothing to eat out of on the contrary i can supply you with everything even if you want to give dinner parties warmly replied chichagv who tried by every word he spoke to prove his own rectitude and therefore imagined kutzov to be animated by the same desire kutzov shrugging his shoulders replied with his subtle penetrating smile i meant merely to say what i said contrary to the emperors wish kutzov detained the greater part of the army at vlna those about him said that he became extraordinarily slack and physically feeble during his stay in that town he attended to army affairs reluctantly left everything to his generals and while awaiting the emperors arrival led a dissipated life having left petersburg on the seventh of december with his suite count tolsty prince volknski arakchev and others the emperor reached vlna on the eleventh and in his traveling sleigh drove straight to the castle in spite of the severe frost some hundred generals and staff officers in full parade uniform stood in front of the castle as well as a guard of honor of the semnov regiment a courier who galloped to the castle in advance in a troyka with three foam-flecked horses shouted coming and konovntsyn rushed into the vestibule to inform kutzov who was waiting in the hall porters little lodge a minute later the old mans large stout figure in full-dress uniform his chest covered with orders and a scarf drawn round his stomach waddled out into the porch he put on his hat with its peaks to the sides and holding his gloves in his hand and walking with an effort sideways down the steps to the level of the street took in his hand the report he had prepared for the emperor there was running to and fro and whispering another troyka flew furiously up and then all eyes were turned on an approaching sleigh in which the figures of the emperor and volknski could already be descried from the habit of fifty years all this had a physically agitating effect on the old general he carefully and hastily felt himself all over readjusted his hat and pulling himself together drew himself up and at the very moment when the emperor having alighted from the sleigh lifted his eyes to him handed him the report and began speaking in his smooth ingratiating voice the emperor with a rapid glance scanned kutzov from head to foot frowned for an instant but immediately mastering himself went up to the old man extended his arms and embraced him
