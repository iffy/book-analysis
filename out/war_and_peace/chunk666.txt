meanwhile morel was sitting in the best place by the fire surrounded by the soldiers morel a short sturdy frenchman with inflamed and streaming eyes was wearing a womans cloak and had a shawl tied woman fashion round his head over his cap he was evidently tipsy and was singing a french song in a hoarse broken voice with an arm thrown round the nearest soldier the soldiers simply held their sides as they watched him now then now then teach us how it goes ill soon pick it up how is it said the man a singer and a wag whom morel was embracing vive henri quatre vive ce roi valiant sang morel winking ce diable quatre long live henry the fourth that valiant king that rowdy devil vivarika vif-seruvaru sedyablyaka repeated the soldier flourishing his arm and really catching the tune bravo ha ha ha rose their rough joyous laughter from all sides morel wrinkling up his face laughed too well go on go on qui eut le triple talent de boire de battre et dtre un vert galant who had a triple talent for drinking for fighting and for being a gallant old boy it goes smoothly too well now zaletev ke zaletev brought out with effort ke-e-e-e he drawled laboriously pursing his lips le-trip-ta-la-de-bu-de-ba e de-tra-va-ga-la he sang fine just like the frenchie oh ho ho do you want some more to eat give him some porridge it takes a long time to get filled up after starving they gave him some more porridge and morel with a laugh set to work on his third bowl all the young soldiers smiled gaily as they watched him the older men who thought it undignified to amuse themselves with such nonsense continued to lie at the opposite side of the fire but one would occasionally raise himself on an elbow and glance at morel with a smile they are men too said one of them as he wrapped himself up in his coat even wormwood grows on its own root o lord o lord how starry it is tremendous that means a hard frost they all grew silent the stars as if knowing that no one was looking at them began to disport themselves in the dark sky now flaring up now vanishing now trembling they were busy whispering something gladsome and mysterious to one another chapter x the french army melted away at the uniform rate of a mathematical progression and that crossing of the berzina about which so much has been written was only one intermediate stage in its destruction and not at all the decisive episode of the campaign if so much has been and still is written about the berzina on the french side this is only because at the broken bridge across that river the calamities their army had been previously enduring were suddenly concentrated at one moment into a tragic spectacle that remained in every memory and on the russian side merely because in petersburg far from the seat of war a plan again one of pfuels had been devised to catch napoleon in a strategic trap at the berzina river everyone assured himself that all would happen according to plan and therefore insisted that it was just the crossing of the berzina that destroyed the french army in reality the results of the crossing were much less disastrous to the french in guns and men lost than krsnoe had been as the figures show the sole importance of the crossing of the berzina lies in the fact that it plainly and indubitably proved the fallacy of all the plans for cutting off the enemys retreat and the soundness of the only possible line of action the one kutzov and the general mass of the army demanded namely simply to follow the enemy up the french crowd fled at a continually increasing speed and all its energy was directed to reaching its goal it fled like a wounded animal and it was impossible to block its path this was shown not so much by the arrangements it made for crossing as by what took place at the bridges when the bridges broke down unarmed soldiers people from moscow and women with children who were with the french transport all carried on by vis inerti pressed forward into boats and into the ice-covered water and did not surrender that impulse was reasonable the condition of fugitives and of pursuers was equally bad as long as they remained with their own people each might hope for
