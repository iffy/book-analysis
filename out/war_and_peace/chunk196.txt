departure did not prevent his amusing himself but rather gave zest to his pleasures he spent the greater part of his time away from home at dinners parties and balls chapter xi on the third day after christmas nicholas dined at home a thing he had rarely done of late it was a grand farewell dinner as he and densov were leaving to join their regiment after epiphany about twenty people were present including dlokhov and densov never had love been so much in the air and never had the amorous atmosphere made itself so strongly felt in the rostvs house as at this holiday time seize the moments of happiness love and be loved that is the only reality in the world all else is folly it is the one thing we are interested in here said the spirit of the place nicholas having as usual exhausted two pairs of horses without visiting all the places he meant to go to and where he had been invited returned home just before dinner as soon as he entered he noticed and felt the tension of the amorous air in the house and also noticed a curious embarrassment among some of those present snya dlokhov and the old countess were especially disturbed and to a lesser degree natsha nicholas understood that something must have happened between snya and dlokhov before dinner and with the kindly sensitiveness natural to him was very gentle and wary with them both at dinner on that same evening there was to be one of the balls that iogel the dancing master gave for his pupils during the holidays nicholas will you come to iogels please do said natsha he asked you and vasli dmtrich is also going densov where would i not go at the countess command said densov who at the rostvs had jocularly assumed the role of natshas knight im even weady to dance the pas de chle if i have time answered nicholas but i promised the arkhrovs they have a party and you he asked dlokhov but as soon as he had asked the question he noticed that it should not have been put perhaps coldly and angrily replied dlokhov glancing at snya and scowling he gave nicholas just such a look as he had given pierre at the club dinner there is something up thought nicholas and he was further confirmed in this conclusion by the fact that dlokhov left immediately after dinner he called natsha and asked her what was the matter and i was looking for you said natsha running out to him i told you but you would not believe it she said triumphantly he has proposed to snya little as nicholas had occupied himself with snya of late something seemed to give way within him at this news dlokhov was a suitable and in some respects a brilliant match for the dowerless orphan girl from the point of view of the old countess and of society it was out of the question for her to refuse him and therefore nicholas first feeling on hearing the news was one of anger with snya he tried to say thats capital of course shell forget her childish promises and accept the offer but before he had time to say it natsha began again and fancy she refused him quite definitely adding after a pause she told him she loved another yes my snya could not have done otherwise thought nicholas much as mamma pressed her she refused and i know she wont change once she has said and mamma pressed her said nicholas reproachfully yes said natsha do you know nicholas dont be angry but i know you will not marry her i know heaven knows how but i know for certain that you wont marry her now you dont know that at all said nicholas but i must talk to her what a darling snya is he added with a smile ah she is indeed a darling ill send her to you and natsha kissed her brother and ran away a minute later snya came in with a frightened guilty and scared look nicholas went up to her and kissed her hand this was the first time since his return that they had talked alone and about their love sophie he began timidly at first and then more and more boldly if you wish to refuse one who is not only a brilliant and advantageous match but a splendid noble fellow he is my friend snya interrupted him i have already
