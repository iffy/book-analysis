or the restoration of the bourbons plainly assert that these events were produced by the will of alexander but the universal historian gervinus refuting this opinion of the specialist historian tries to prove that the campaign of and the restoration of the bourbons were due to other things beside alexanders will such as the activity of stein metternich madame de stal talleyrand fichte chateaubriand and others the historian evidently decomposes alexanders power into the components talleyrand chateaubriand and the rest but the sum of the components that is the interactions of chateaubriand talleyrand madame de stal and the others evidently does not equal the resultant namely the phenomenon of millions of frenchmen submitting to the bourbons that chateaubriand madame de stal and others spoke certain words to one another only affected their mutual relations but does not account for the submission of millions and therefore to explain how from these relations of theirs the submission of millions of people resulted that is how component forces equal to one a gave a resultant equal to a thousand times a the historian is again obliged to fall back on power the force he had denied and to recognize it as the resultant of the forces that is he has to admit an unexplained force acting on the resultant and that is just what the universal historians do and consequently they not only contradict the specialist historians but contradict themselves peasants having no clear idea of the cause of rain say according to whether they want rain or fine weather the wind has blown the clouds away or the wind has brought up the clouds and in the same way the universal historians sometimes when it pleases them and fits in with their theory say that power is the result of events and sometimes when they want to prove something else say that power produces events a third class of historians the so-called historians of culture following the path laid down by the universal historians who sometimes accept writers and ladies as forces producing events again take that force to be something quite different they see it in what is called culture in mental activity the historians of culture are quite consistent in regard to their progenitors the writers of universal histories for if historical events may be explained by the fact that certain persons treated one another in such and such ways why not explain them by the fact that such and such people wrote such and such books of the immense number of indications accompanying every vital phenomenon these historians select the indication of intellectual activity and say that this indication is the cause but despite their endeavors to prove that the cause of events lies in intellectual activity only by a great stretch can one admit that there is any connection between intellectual activity and the movement of peoples and in no case can one admit that intellectual activity controls peoples actions for that view is not confirmed by such facts as the very cruel murders of the french revolution resulting from the doctrine of the equality of man or the very cruel wars and executions resulting from the preaching of love but even admitting as correct all the cunningly devised arguments with which these histories are filled admitting that nations are governed by some undefined force called an idea historys essential question still remains unanswered and to the former power of monarchs and to the influence of advisers and other people introduced by the universal historians another newer force the idea is added the connection of which with the masses needs explanation it is possible to understand that napoleon had power and so events occurred with some effort one may even conceive that napoleon together with other influences was the cause of an event but how a book le contrat social had the effect of making frenchmen begin to drown one another cannot be understood without an explanation of the causal nexus of this new force with the event undoubtedly some relation exists between all who live contemporaneously and so it is possible to find some connection between the intellectual activity of men and their historical movements just as such a connection may be found between the movements of humanity and commerce handicraft gardening or anything else you please but why intellectual activity is considered by the historians of culture to be the cause or expression of the whole historical movement is hard to understand only the following considerations can have led the historians to such a conclusion that history is
