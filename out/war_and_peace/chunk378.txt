prepare an asylum for them in russia balashv bowed his head with an air indicating that he would like to make his bow and leave and only listened because he could not help hearing what was said to him napoleon did not notice this expression he treated balashv not as an envoy from his enemy but as a man now fully devoted to him and who must rejoice at his former masters humiliation and why has the emperor alexander taken command of the armies what is the good of that war is my profession but his business is to reign and not to command armies why has he taken on himself such a responsibility again napoleon brought out his snuffbox paced several times up and down the room in silence and then suddenly and unexpectedly went up to balashv and with a slight smile as confidently quickly and simply as if he were doing something not merely important but pleasing to balashv he raised his hand to the forty-year-old russian generals face and taking him by the ear pulled it gently smiling with his lips only to have ones ear pulled by the emperor was considered the greatest honor and mark of favor at the french court well adorer and courtier of the emperor alexander why dont you say anything said he as if it was ridiculous in his presence to be the adorer and courtier of anyone but himself napoleon are the horses ready for the general he added with a slight inclination of his head in reply to balashvs bow let him have mine he has a long way to go the letter taken by balashv was the last napoleon sent to alexander every detail of the interview was communicated to the russian monarch and the war began chapter viii after his interview with pierre in moscow prince andrew went to petersburg on business as he told his family but really to meet anatole kurgin whom he felt it necessary to encounter on reaching petersburg he inquired for kurgin but the latter had already left the city pierre had warned his brother-in-law that prince andrew was on his track anatole kurgin promptly obtained an appointment from the minister of war and went to join the army in moldavia while in petersburg prince andrew met kutzov his former commander who was always well disposed toward him and kutzov suggested that he should accompany him to the army in moldavia to which the old general had been appointed commander in chief so prince andrew having received an appointment on the headquarters staff left for turkey prince andrew did not think it proper to write and challenge kurgin he thought that if he challenged him without some fresh cause it might compromise the young countess rostva and so he wanted to meet kurgin personally in order to find a fresh pretext for a duel but he again failed to meet kurgin in turkey for soon after prince andrew arrived the latter returned to russia in a new country amid new conditions prince andrew found life easier to bear after his betrothed had broken faith with him which he felt the more acutely the more he tried to conceal its effects the surroundings in which he had been happy became trying to him and the freedom and independence he had once prized so highly were still more so not only could he no longer think the thoughts that had first come to him as he lay gazing at the sky on the field of austerlitz and had later enlarged upon with pierre and which had filled his solitude at boguchrovo and then in switzerland and rome but he even dreaded to recall them and the bright and boundless horizons they had revealed he was now concerned only with the nearest practical matters unrelated to his past interests and he seized on these the more eagerly the more those past interests were closed to him it was as if that lofty infinite canopy of heaven that had once towered above him had suddenly turned into a low solid vault that weighed him down in which all was clear but nothing eternal or mysterious of the activities that presented themselves to him army service was the simplest and most familiar as a general on duty on kutzovs staff he applied himself to business with zeal and perseverance and surprised kutzov by his willingness and accuracy in work not having found kurgin in turkey prince andrew did not think it necessary to rush back to russia after
