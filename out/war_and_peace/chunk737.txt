unconditioned freedom beyond space time and cause which by the fact of its being unconditioned and unlimited would be nothing or mere content without form we should in fact have reached those two fundamentals of which mans whole outlook on the universe is constructed the incomprehensible essence of life and the laws defining that essence reason says space with all the forms of matter that give it visibility is infinite and cannot be imagined otherwise time is infinite motion without a moment of rest and is unthinkable otherwise the connection between cause and effect has no beginning and can have no end consciousness says i alone am and all that exists is but me consequently i include space i measure flowing time by the fixed moment of the present in which alone i am conscious of myself as living consequently i am outside time i am beyond cause for i feel myself to be the cause of every manifestation of my life reason gives expression to the laws of inevitability consciousness gives expression to the essence of freedom freedom not limited by anything is the essence of life in mans consciousness inevitability without content is mans reason in its three forms freedom is the thing examined inevitability is what examines freedom is the content inevitability is the form only by separating the two sources of cognition related to one another as form to content do we get the mutually exclusive and separately incomprehensible conceptions of freedom and inevitability only by uniting them do we get a clear conception of mans life apart from these two concepts which in their union mutually define one another as form and content no conception of life is possible all that we know of the life of man is merely a certain relation of free will to inevitability that is of consciousness to the laws of reason all that we know of the external world of nature is only a certain relation of the forces of nature to inevitability or of the essence of life to the laws of reason the great natural forces lie outside us and we are not conscious of them we call those forces gravitation inertia electricity animal force and so on but we are conscious of the force of life in man and we call that freedom but just as the force of gravitation incomprehensible in itself but felt by every man is understood by us only to the extent to which we know the laws of inevitability to which it is subject from the first knowledge that all bodies have weight up to newtons law so too the force of free will incomprehensible in itself but of which everyone is conscious is intelligible to us only in as far as we know the laws of inevitability to which it is subject from the fact that every man dies up to the knowledge of the most complex economic and historic laws all knowledge is merely a bringing of this essence of life under the laws of reason mans free will differs from every other force in that man is directly conscious of it but in the eyes of reason it in no way differs from any other force the forces of gravitation electricity or chemical affinity are only distinguished from one another in that they are differently defined by reason just so the force of mans free will is distinguished by reason from the other forces of nature only by the definition reason gives it freedom apart from necessity that is apart from the laws of reason that define it differs in no way from gravitation or heat or the force that makes things grow for reason it is only a momentary undefinable sensation of life and as the undefinable essence of the force moving the heavenly bodies the undefinable essence of the forces of heat and electricity or of chemical affinity or of the vital force forms the content of astronomy physics chemistry botany zoology and so on just in the same way does the force of free will form the content of history but just as the subject of every science is the manifestation of this unknown essence of life while that essence itself can only be the subject of metaphysics even the manifestation of the force of free will in human beings in space in time and in dependence on cause forms the subject of history while free will itself is the subject of metaphysics in the experimental sciences what we know we call the laws of inevitability what
