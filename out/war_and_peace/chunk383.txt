they saw only barbarism ignorance or evil intention in every deviation from that theory to this party belonged the foreign nobles wolzogen wintzingerode and others chiefly germans the second party was directly opposed to the first one extreme as always happens was met by representatives of the other the members of this party were those who had demanded an advance from vlna into poland and freedom from all prearranged plans besides being advocates of bold action this section also represented nationalism which made them still more one-sided in the dispute they were russians bagratin ermlov who was beginning to come to the front and others at that time a famous joke of ermlovs was being circulated that as a great favor he had petitioned the emperor to make him a german the men of that party remembering suvrov said that what one had to do was not to reason or stick pins into maps but to fight beat the enemy keep him out of russia and not let the army get discouraged to the third party in which the emperor had most confidence belonged the courtiers who tried to arrange compromises between the other two the members of this party chiefly civilians and to whom arakchev belonged thought and said what men who have no convictions but wish to seem to have some generally say they said that undoubtedly war particularly against such a genius as bonaparte they called him bonaparte now needs most deeply devised plans and profound scientific knowledge and in that respect pfuel was a genius but at the same time it had to be acknowledged that the theorists are often one-sided and therefore one should not trust them absolutely but should also listen to what pfuels opponents and practical men of experience in warfare had to say and then choose a middle course they insisted on the retention of the camp at drissa according to pfuels plan but on changing the movements of the other armies though by this course neither one aim nor the other could be attained yet it seemed best to the adherents of this third party of a fourth opinion the most conspicuous representative was the tsarvich who could not forget his disillusionment at austerlitz where he had ridden out at the head of the guards in his casque and cavalry uniform as to a review expecting to crush the french gallantly but unexpectedly finding himself in the front line had narrowly escaped amid the general confusion the men of this party had both the quality and the defect of frankness in their opinions they feared napoleon recognized his strength and their own weakness and frankly said so they said nothing but sorrow shame and ruin will come of all this we have abandoned vlna and vtebsk and shall abandon drissa the only reasonable thing left to do is to conclude peace as soon as possible before we are turned out of petersburg this view was very general in the upper army circles and found support also in petersburg and from the chancellor rumyntsev who for other reasons of state was in favor of peace the fifth party consisted of those who were adherents of barclay de tolly not so much as a man but as minister of war and commander in chief be he what he may they always began like that he is an honest practical man and we have nobody better give him real power for war cannot be conducted successfully without unity of command and he will show what he can do as he did in finland if our army is well organized and strong and has withdrawn to drissa without suffering any defeats we owe this entirely to barclay if barclay is now to be superseded by bennigsen all will be lost for bennigsen showed his incapacity already in the sixth party the bennigsenites said on the contrary that at any rate there was no one more active and experienced than bennigsen and twist about as you may you will have to come to bennigsen eventually let the others make mistakes now said they arguing that our retirement to drissa was a most shameful reverse and an unbroken series of blunders the more mistakes that are made the better it will at any rate be understood all the sooner that things cannot go on like this what is wanted is not some barclay or other but a man like bennigsen who made his mark in and to whom napoleon himself did justice a man whose authority would be willingly
