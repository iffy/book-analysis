letters by madame de souza he began reading about the sufferings and virtuous struggles of a certain emilie de mansfeld and why did she resist her seducer when she loved him he thought god could not have put into her heart an impulse that was against his will my wife as she once was did not struggle and perhaps she was right nothing has been found out nothing discovered pierre again said to himself all we can know is that we know nothing and thats the height of human wisdom everything within and around him seemed confused senseless and repellent yet in this very repugnance to all his circumstances pierre found a kind of tantalizing satisfaction i make bold to ask your excellency to move a little for this gentleman said the postmaster entering the room followed by another traveler also detained for lack of horses the newcomer was a short large-boned yellow-faced wrinkled old man with gray bushy eyebrows overhanging bright eyes of an indefinite grayish color pierre took his feet off the table stood up and lay down on a bed that had been got ready for him glancing now and then at the newcomer who with a gloomy and tired face was wearily taking off his wraps with the aid of his servant and not looking at pierre with a pair of felt boots on his thin bony legs and keeping on a worn nankeen-covered sheepskin coat the traveler sat down on the sofa leaned back his big head with its broad temples and close-cropped hair and looked at bezkhov the stern shrewd and penetrating expression of that look struck pierre he felt a wish to speak to the stranger but by the time he had made up his mind to ask him a question about the roads the traveler had closed his eyes his shriveled old hands were folded and on the finger of one of them pierre noticed a large cast iron ring with a seal representing a deaths head the stranger sat without stirring either resting or as it seemed to pierre sunk in profound and calm meditation his servant was also a yellow wrinkled old man without beard or mustache evidently not because he was shaven but because they had never grown this active old servant was unpacking the travelers canteen and preparing tea he brought in a boiling samovar when everything was ready the stranger opened his eyes moved to the table filled a tumbler with tea for himself and one for the beardless old man to whom he passed it pierre began to feel a sense of uneasiness and the need even the inevitability of entering into conversation with this stranger the servant brought back his tumbler turned upside down with an unfinished bit of nibbled sugar and asked if anything more would be wanted to indicate he did not want more tea no give me the book said the stranger the servant handed him a book which pierre took to be a devotional work and the traveler became absorbed in it pierre looked at him all at once the stranger closed the book putting in a marker and again leaning with his arms on the back of the sofa sat in his former position with his eyes shut pierre looked at him and had not time to turn away when the old man opening his eyes fixed his steady and severe gaze straight on pierres face pierre felt confused and wished to avoid that look but the bright old eyes attracted him irresistibly chapter ii i have the pleasure of addressing count bezkhov if i am not mistaken said the stranger in a deliberate and loud voice pierre looked silently and inquiringly at him over his spectacles i have heard of you my dear sir continued the stranger and of your misfortune he seemed to emphasize the last word as if to say yes misfortune call it what you please i know that what happened to you in moscow was a misfortune i regret it very much my dear sir pierre flushed and hurriedly putting his legs down from the bed bent forward toward the old man with a forced and timid smile i have not referred to this out of curiosity my dear sir but for greater reasons he paused his gaze still on pierre and moved aside on the sofa by way of inviting the other to take a seat beside him pierre felt reluctant to enter into conversation with this old man but submitting to him involuntarily came up
