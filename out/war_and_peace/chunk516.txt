a friendly manner we are on the eve of a public disaster and i havent time to be polite to everybody who has business with me my head is sometimes in a whirl well mon cher what are you doing personally why nothing answered pierre without raising his eyes or changing the thoughtful expression of his face the count frowned a word of friendly advice mon cher be off as soon as you can thats all i have to tell you happy he who has ears to hear good-by my dear fellow oh by the by he shouted through the doorway after pierre is it true that the countess has fallen into the clutches of the holy fathers of the society of jesus pierre did not answer and left rostopchns room more sullen and angry than he had ever before shown himself when he reached home it was already getting dark some eight people had come to see him that evening the secretary of a committee the colonel of his battalion his steward his major-domo and various petitioners they all had business with pierre and wanted decisions from him pierre did not understand and was not interested in any of these questions and only answered them in order to get rid of these people when left alone at last he opened and read his wifes letter they the soldiers at the battery prince andrew killed that old man simplicity is submission to god suffering is necessary the meaning of all one must harness my wife is getting married one must forget and understand and going to his bed he threw himself on it without undressing and immediately fell asleep when he awoke next morning the major-domo came to inform him that a special messenger a police officer had come from count rostopchn to know whether count bezkhov had left or was leaving the town a dozen persons who had business with pierre were awaiting him in the drawing room pierre dressed hurriedly and instead of going to see them went to the back porch and out through the gate from that time till the end of the destruction of moscow no one of bezkhovs household despite all the search they made saw pierre again or knew where he was chapter xii the rostvs remained in moscow till the first of september that is till the eve of the enemys entry into the city after ptya had joined obolnskis regiment of cossacks and left for blaya tsrkov where that regiment was forming the countess was seized with terror the thought that both her sons were at the war had both gone from under her wing that today or tomorrow either or both of them might be killed like the three sons of one of her acquaintances struck her that summer for the first time with cruel clearness she tried to get nicholas back and wished to go herself to join ptya or to get him an appointment somewhere in petersburg but neither of these proved possible ptya could not return unless his regiment did so or unless he was transferred to another regiment on active service nicholas was somewhere with the army and had not sent a word since his last letter in which he had given a detailed account of his meeting with princess mary the countess did not sleep at night or when she did fall asleep dreamed that she saw her sons lying dead after many consultations and conversations the count at last devised means to tranquillize her he got ptya transferred from obolnskis regiment to bezkhovs which was in training near moscow though ptya would remain in the service this transfer would give the countess the consolation of seeing at least one of her sons under her wing and she hoped to arrange matters for her ptya so as not to let him go again but always get him appointed to places where he could not possibly take part in a battle as long as nicholas alone was in danger the countess imagined that she loved her first-born more than all her other children and even reproached herself for it but when her youngest the scapegrace who had been bad at lessons was always breaking things in the house and making himself a nuisance to everybody that snub-nosed ptya with his merry black eyes and fresh rosy cheeks where soft down was just beginning to show when he was thrown amid those big dreadful cruel men who were fighting somewhere about something and apparently finding pleasure in it then
