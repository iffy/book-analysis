physically tranquil his mind devised reasons why he should be mentally tranquil too the thought which tranquillized rostopchn was not a new one since the world began and men have killed one another no one has ever committed such a crime against his fellow man without comforting himself with this same idea this idea is le bien public the hypothetical welfare of other people to a man not swayed by passion that welfare is never certain but he who commits such a crime always knows just where that welfare lies and rostopchn now knew it not only did his reason not reproach him for what he had done but he even found cause for self-satisfaction in having so successfully contrived to avail himself of a convenient opportunity to punish a criminal and at the same time pacify the mob vereshchgin was tried and condemned to death thought rostopchn though the senate had only condemned vereshchgin to hard labor he was a traitor and a spy i could not let him go unpunished and so i have killed two birds with one stone to appease the mob i gave them a victim and at the same time punished a miscreant having reached his country house and begun to give orders about domestic arrangements the count grew quite tranquil half an hour later he was driving with his fast horses across the soklniki field no longer thinking of what had occurred but considering what was to come he was driving to the yaza bridge where he had heard that kutzov was count rostopchn was mentally preparing the angry and stinging reproaches he meant to address to kutzov for his deception he would make that foxy old courtier feel that the responsibility for all the calamities that would follow the abandonment of the city and the ruin of russia as rostopchn regarded it would fall upon his doting old head planning beforehand what he would say to kutzov rostopchn turned angrily in his calche and gazed sternly from side to side the soklniki field was deserted only at the end of it in front of the almshouse and the lunatic asylum could be seen some people in white and others like them walking singly across the field shouting and gesticulating one of these was running to cross the path of count rostopchns carriage and the count himself his coachman and his dragoons looked with vague horror and curiosity at these released lunatics and especially at the one running toward them swaying from side to side on his long thin legs in his fluttering dressing gown this lunatic was running impetuously his gaze fixed on rostopchn shouting something in a hoarse voice and making signs to him to stop the lunatics solemn gloomy face was thin and yellow with its beard growing in uneven tufts his black agate pupils with saffron-yellow whites moved restlessly near the lower eyelids stop pull up i tell you he cried in a piercing voice and again shouted something breathlessly with emphatic intonations and gestures coming abreast of the calche he ran beside it thrice have they slain me thrice have i risen from the dead they stoned me crucified me i shall rise shall rise shall rise they have torn my body the kingdom of god will be overthrown thrice will i overthrow it and thrice re-establish it he cried raising his voice higher and higher count rostopchn suddenly grew pale as he had done when the crowd closed in on vereshchgin he turned away go fas faster he cried in a trembling voice to his coachman the calche flew over the ground as fast as the horses could draw it but for a long time count rostopchn still heard the insane despairing screams growing fainter in the distance while his eyes saw nothing but the astonished frightened bloodstained face of the traitor in the fur-lined coat recent as that mental picture was rostopchn already felt that it had cut deep into his heart and drawn blood even now he felt clearly that the gory trace of that recollection would not pass with time but that the terrible memory would on the contrary dwell in his heart ever more cruelly and painfully to the end of his life he seemed still to hear the sound of his own words cut him down i command it why did i utter those words it was by some accident i said them i need not have said them he thought and then nothing would have happened he saw the frightened and then infuriated
