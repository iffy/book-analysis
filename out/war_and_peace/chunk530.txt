forward to the bridge onto it and to the fords and the boats kutzov himself had driven round by side streets to the other side of moscow by ten oclock in the morning of the second of september only the rear guard remained in the dorogomlov suburb where they had ample room the main army was on the other side of moscow or beyond it at that very time at ten in the morning of the second of september napoleon was standing among his troops on the poklnny hill looking at the panorama spread out before him from the twenty-sixth of august to the second of september that is from the battle of borodin to the entry of the french into moscow during the whole of that agitating memorable week there had been the extraordinary autumn weather that always comes as a surprise when the sun hangs low and gives more heat than in spring when everything shines so brightly in the rare clear atmosphere that the eyes smart when the lungs are strengthened and refreshed by inhaling the aromatic autumn air when even the nights are warm and when in those dark warm nights golden stars startle and delight us continually by falling from the sky at ten in the morning of the second of september this weather still held the brightness of the morning was magical moscow seen from the poklnny hill lay spaciously spread out with her river her gardens and her churches and she seemed to be living her usual life her cupolas glittering like stars in the sunlight the view of the strange city with its peculiar architecture such as he had never seen before filled napoleon with the rather envious and uneasy curiosity men feel when they see an alien form of life that has no knowledge of them this city was evidently living with the full force of its own life by the indefinite signs which even at a distance distinguish a living body from a dead one napoleon from the poklnny hill perceived the throb of life in the town and felt as it were the breathing of that great and beautiful body every russian looking at moscow feels her to be a mother every foreigner who sees her even if ignorant of her significance as the mother city must feel her feminine character and napoleon felt it cette ville asiatique aux innombrables glises moscou la sainte la voil donc enfin cette fameuse ville il tait temps said he and dismounting he ordered a plan of moscow to be spread out before him and summoned lelorgne dideville the interpreter that asiatic city of the innumerable churches holy moscow here it is then at last that famous city it was high time a town captured by the enemy is like a maid who has lost her honor thought he he had said so to tchkov at smolnsk from that point of view he gazed at the oriental beauty he had not seen before it seemed strange to him that his long-felt wish which had seemed unattainable had at last been realized in the clear morning light he gazed now at the city and now at the plan considering its details and the assurance of possessing it agitated and awed him but could it be otherwise he thought here is this capital at my feet where is alexander now and of what is he thinking a strange beautiful and majestic city and a strange and majestic moment in what light must i appear to them thought he thinking of his troops here she is the reward for all those fainthearted men he reflected glancing at those near him and at the troops who were approaching and forming up one word from me one movement of my hand and that ancient capital of the tsars would perish but my clemency is always ready to descend upon the vanquished i must be magnanimous and truly great but no it cant be true that i am in moscow he suddenly thought yet here she is lying at my feet with her golden domes and crosses scintillating and twinkling in the sunshine but i shall spare her on the ancient monuments of barbarism and despotism i will inscribe great words of justice and mercy it is just this which alexander will feel most painfully i know him it seemed to napoleon that the chief import of what was taking place lay in the personal struggle between himself and alexander from the height of the krmlin yes there is the krmlin
