great commander rostv charged the french because he could not restrain his wish for a gallop across a level field and in the same way the innumerable people who took part in the war acted in accord with their personal characteristics habits circumstances and aims they were moved by fear or vanity rejoiced or were indignant reasoned imagining that they knew what they were doing and did it of their own free will but they all were involuntary tools of history carrying on a work concealed from them but comprehensible to us such is the inevitable fate of men of action and the higher they stand in the social hierarchy the less are they free the actors of have long since left the stage their personal interests have vanished leaving no trace and nothing remains of that time but its historic results providence compelled all these men striving to attain personal aims to further the accomplishment of a stupendous result no one of them at all expected neither napoleon nor alexander nor still less any of those who did the actual fighting the cause of the destruction of the french army in is clear to us now no one will deny that that cause was on the one hand its advance into the heart of russia late in the season without any preparation for a winter campaign and on the other the character given to the war by the burning of russian towns and the hatred of the foe this aroused among the russian people but no one at the time foresaw what now seems so evident that this was the only way an army of eight hundred thousand men the best in the world and led by the best general could be destroyed in conflict with a raw army of half its numerical strength and led by inexperienced commanders as the russian army was not only did no one see this but on the russian side every effort was made to hinder the only thing that could save russia while on the french side despite napoleons experience and so-called military genius every effort was directed to pushing on to moscow at the end of the summer that is to doing the very thing that was bound to lead to destruction in historical works on the year french writers are very fond of saying that napoleon felt the danger of extending his line that he sought a battle and that his marshals advised him to stop at smolnsk and of making similar statements to show that the danger of the campaign was even then understood russian authors are still fonder of telling us that from the commencement of the campaign a scythian war plan was adopted to lure napoleon into the depths of russia and this plan some of them attribute to pfuel others to a certain frenchman others to toll and others again to alexander himself pointing to notes projects and letters which contain hints of such a line of action but all these hints at what happened both from the french side and the russian are advanced only because they fit in with the event had that event not occurred these hints would have been forgotten as we have forgotten the thousands and millions of hints and expectations to the contrary which were current then but have now been forgotten because the event falsified them there are always so many conjectures as to the issue of any event that however it may end there will always be people to say i said then that it would be so quite forgetting that amid their innumerable conjectures many were to quite the contrary effect conjectures as to napoleons awareness of the danger of extending his line and on the russian side as to luring the enemy into the depths of russia are evidently of that kind and only by much straining can historians attribute such conceptions to napoleon and his marshals or such plans to the russian commanders all the facts are in flat contradiction to such conjectures during the whole period of the war not only was there no wish on the russian side to draw the french into the heart of the country but from their first entry into russia everything was done to stop them and not only was napoleon not afraid to extend his line but he welcomed every step forward as a triumph and did not seek battle as eagerly as in former campaigns but very lazily at the very beginning of the war our armies were
