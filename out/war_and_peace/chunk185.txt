if you think you may be killed you are a fool and are lost for certain but go with the firm intention of killing your man as quickly and surely as possible and then all will be right as our bear huntsman at kostrom used to tell me everyone fears a bear he says but when you see one your fears all gone and your only thought is not to let him get away and thats how it is with me demain mon cher till tomorrow my dear fellow next day at eight in the morning pierre and nesvtski drove to the soklniki forest and found dlokhov densov and rostv already there pierre had the air of a man preoccupied with considerations which had no connection with the matter in hand his haggard face was yellow he had evidently not slept that night he looked about distractedly and screwed up his eyes as if dazzled by the sun he was entirely absorbed by two considerations his wifes guilt of which after his sleepless night he had not the slightest doubt and the guiltlessness of dlokhov who had no reason to preserve the honor of a man who was nothing to him i should perhaps have done the same thing in his place thought pierre its even certain that i should have done the same then why this duel this murder either i shall kill him or he will hit me in the head or elbow or knee cant i go away from here run away bury myself somewhere passed through his mind but just at moments when such thoughts occurred to him he would ask in a particularly calm and absent-minded way which inspired the respect of the onlookers will it be long are things ready when all was ready the sabers stuck in the snow to mark the barriers and the pistols loaded nesvtski went up to pierre i should not be doing my duty count he said in timid tones and should not justify your confidence and the honor you have done me in choosing me for your second if at this grave this very grave moment i did not tell you the whole truth i think there is no sufficient ground for this affair or for blood to be shed over it you were not right not quite in the right you were impetuous oh yes it is horribly stupid said pierre then allow me to express your regrets and i am sure your opponent will accept them said nesvtski who like the others concerned in the affair and like everyone in similar cases did not yet believe that the affair had come to an actual duel you know count it is much more honorable to admit ones mistake than to let matters become irreparable there was no insult on either side allow me to convey no what is there to talk about said pierre its all the same is everything ready he added only tell me where to go and where to shoot he said with an unnaturally gentle smile he took the pistol in his hand and began asking about the working of the trigger as he had not before held a pistol in his hand a fact that he did not wish to confess oh yes like that i know i only forgot said he no apologies none whatever said dlokhov to densov who on his side had been attempting a reconciliation and he also went up to the appointed place the spot chosen for the duel was some eighty paces from the road where the sleighs had been left in a small clearing in the pine forest covered with melting snow the frost having begun to break up during the last few days the antagonists stood forty paces apart at the farther edge of the clearing the seconds measuring the paces left tracks in the deep wet snow between the place where they had been standing and nesvtskis and dlokhovs sabers which were stuck into the ground ten paces apart to mark the barrier it was thawing and misty at forty paces distance nothing could be seen for three minutes all had been ready but they still delayed and all were silent chapter v well begin said dlokhov all right said pierre still smiling in the same way a feeling of dread was in the air it was evident that the affair so lightly begun could no longer be averted but was taking its course independently of mens will densov first went to the barrier
