that it was impossible for him to arrange his new life without receiving thirty thousand in ready money or at least twenty thousand count he added and then a note of hand for only sixty thousand yes yes all right said the count hurriedly only excuse me my dear fellow ill give you twenty thousand and a note of hand for eighty thousand as well yes yes kiss me chapter xii natsha was sixteen and it was the year the very year to which she had counted on her fingers with bors after they had kissed four years ago since then she had not seen him before snya and her mother if bors happened to be mentioned she spoke quite freely of that episode as of some childish long-forgotten matter that was not worth mentioning but in the secret depths of her soul the question whether her engagement to bors was a jest or an important binding promise tormented her since bors left moscow in to join the army he had not seen the rostvs he had been in moscow several times and had passed near otrdnoe but had never been to see them sometimes it occurred to natsha that he did not wish to see her and this conjecture was confirmed by the sad tone in which her elders spoke of him nowadays old friends are not remembered the countess would say when bors was mentioned anna mikhylovna also had of late visited them less frequently seemed to hold herself with particular dignity and always spoke rapturously and gratefully of the merits of her son and the brilliant career on which he had entered when the rostvs came to petersburg bors called on them he drove to their house in some agitation the memory of natsha was his most poetic recollection but he went with the firm intention of letting her and her parents feel that the childish relations between himself and natsha could not be binding either on her or on him he had a brilliant position in society thanks to his intimacy with countess bezkhova a brilliant position in the service thanks to the patronage of an important personage whose complete confidence he enjoyed and he was beginning to make plans for marrying one of the richest heiresses in petersburg plans which might very easily be realized when he entered the rostvs drawing room natsha was in her own room when she heard of his arrival she almost ran into the drawing room flushed and beaming with a more than cordial smile bors remembered natsha in a short dress with dark eyes shining from under her curls and boisterous childish laughter as he had known her four years before and so he was taken aback when quite a different natsha entered and his face expressed rapturous astonishment this expression on his face pleased natsha well do you recognize your little madcap playmate asked the countess bors kissed natshas hand and said that he was astonished at the change in her how handsome you have grown i should think so replied natshas laughing eyes and is papa older she asked natsha sat down and without joining in bors conversation with the countess silently and minutely studied her childhoods suitor he felt the weight of that resolute and affectionate scrutiny and glanced at her occasionally bors uniform spurs tie and the way his hair was brushed were all comme il faut and in the latest fashion this natsha noticed at once he sat rather sideways in the armchair next to the countess arranging with his right hand the cleanest of gloves that fitted his left hand like a skin and he spoke with a particularly refined compression of his lips about the amusements of the highest petersburg society recalling with mild irony old times in moscow and moscow acquaintances it was not accidentally natsha felt that he alluded when speaking of the highest aristocracy to an ambassadors ball he had attended and to invitations he had received from nn and ss all this time natsha sat silent glancing up at him from under her brows this gaze disturbed and confused bors more and more he looked round more frequently toward her and broke off in what he was saying he did not stay more than ten minutes then rose and took his leave the same inquisitive challenging and rather mocking eyes still looked at him after his first visit bors said to himself that natsha attracted him just as much as ever but that he must not yield to that feeling
