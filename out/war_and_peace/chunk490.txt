he would say to one or another of those about him or no dont wed better wait he listened to the reports that were brought him and gave directions when his subordinates demanded that of him but when listening to the reports it seemed as if he were not interested in the import of the words spoken but rather in something else in the expression of face and tone of voice of those who were reporting by long years of military experience he knew and with the wisdom of age understood that it is impossible for one man to direct hundreds of thousands of others struggling with death and he knew that the result of a battle is decided not by the orders of a commander in chief nor the place where the troops are stationed nor by the number of cannon or of slaughtered men but by that intangible force called the spirit of the army and he watched this force and guided it in as far as that was in his power kutzovs general expression was one of concentrated quiet attention and his face wore a strained look as if he found it difficult to master the fatigue of his old and feeble body at eleven oclock they brought him news that the flches captured by the french had been retaken but that prince bagratin was wounded kutzov groaned and swayed his head ride over to prince peter ivnovich and find out about it exactly he said to one of his adjutants and then turned to the duke of wrttemberg who was standing behind him will your highness please take command of the first army soon after the dukes departure before he could possibly have reached semnovsk his adjutant came back from him and told kutzov that the duke asked for more troops kutzov made a grimace and sent an order to dokhtrov to take over the command of the first army and a request to the duke whom he said he could not spare at such an important moment to return to him when they brought him news that murat had been taken prisoner and the staff officers congratulated him kutzov smiled wait a little gentlemen said he the battle is won and there is nothing extraordinary in the capture of murat still it is better to wait before we rejoice but he sent an adjutant to take the news round the army when scherbnin came galloping from the left flank with news that the french had captured the flches and the village of semnovsk kutzov guessing by the sounds of the battle and by scherbnins looks that the news was bad rose as if to stretch his legs and taking scherbnins arm led him aside go my dear fellow he said to ermlov and see whether something cant be done kutzov was in grki near the center of the russian position the attack directed by napoleon against our left flank had been several times repulsed in the center the french had not got beyond borodin and on their left flank uvrovs cavalry had put the french to flight toward three oclock the french attacks ceased on the faces of all who came from the field of battle and of those who stood around him kutzov noticed an expression of extreme tension he was satisfied with the days success a success exceeding his expectations but the old mans strength was failing him several times his head dropped low as if it were falling and he dozed off dinner was brought him adjutant general wolzogen the man who when riding past prince andrew had said the war should be extended widely and whom bagratin so detested rode up while kutzov was at dinner wolzogen had come from barclay de tolly to report on the progress of affairs on the left flank the sagacious barclay de tolly seeing crowds of wounded men running back and the disordered rear of the army weighed all the circumstances concluded that the battle was lost and sent his favorite officer to the commander in chief with that news kutzov was chewing a piece of roast chicken with difficulty and glanced at wolzogen with eyes that brightened under their puckering lids wolzogen nonchalantly stretching his legs approached kutzov with a half-contemptuous smile on his lips scarcely touching the peak of his cap he treated his serene highness with a somewhat affected nonchalance intended to show that as a highly trained military man he left it to russians to make an idol of this useless old man
