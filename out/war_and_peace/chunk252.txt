him in the forest the harness bells sounded yet more muffled than they had done six weeks before for now all was thick shady and dense and the young firs dotted about in the forest did not jar on the general beauty but lending themselves to the mood around were delicately green with fluffy young shoots the whole day had been hot somewhere a storm was gathering but only a small cloud had scattered some raindrops lightly sprinkling the road and the sappy leaves the left side of the forest was dark in the shade the right side glittered in the sunlight wet and shiny and scarcely swayed by the breeze everything was in blossom the nightingales trilled and their voices reverberated now near now far away yes here in this forest was that oak with which i agreed thought prince andrew but where is it he again wondered gazing at the left side of the road and without recognizing it he looked with admiration at the very oak he sought the old oak quite transfigured spreading out a canopy of sappy dark-green foliage stood rapt and slightly trembling in the rays of the evening sun neither gnarled fingers nor old scars nor old doubts and sorrows were any of them in evidence now through the hard century-old bark even where there were no twigs leaves had sprouted such as one could hardly believe the old veteran could have produced yes it is the same oak thought prince andrew and all at once he was seized by an unreasoning springtime feeling of joy and renewal all the best moments of his life suddenly rose to his memory austerlitz with the lofty heavens his wifes dead reproachful face pierre at the ferry that girl thrilled by the beauty of the night and that night itself and the moon and all this rushed suddenly to his mind no life is not over at thirty-one prince andrew suddenly decided finally and decisively it is not enough for me to know what i have in me everyone must know it pierre and that young girl who wanted to fly away into the sky everyone must know me so that my life may not be lived for myself alone while others live so apart from it but so that it may be reflected in them all and they and i may live in harmony on reaching home prince andrew decided to go to petersburg that autumn and found all sorts of reasons for this decision a whole series of sensible and logical considerations showing it to be essential for him to go to petersburg and even to re-enter the service kept springing up in his mind he could not now understand how he could ever even have doubted the necessity of taking an active share in life just as a month before he had not understood how the idea of leaving the quiet country could ever enter his head it now seemed clear to him that all his experience of life must be senselessly wasted unless he applied it to some kind of work and again played an active part in life he did not even remember how formerly on the strength of similar wretched logical arguments it had seemed obvious that he would be degrading himself if he now after the lessons he had had in life allowed himself to believe in the possibility of being useful and in the possibility of happiness or love now reason suggested quite the opposite after that journey to ryazn he found the country dull his former pursuits no longer interested him and often when sitting alone in his study he got up went to the mirror and gazed a long time at his own face then he would turn away to the portrait of his dead lise who with hair curled la grecque looked tenderly and gaily at him out of the gilt frame she did not now say those former terrible words to him but looked simply merrily and inquisitively at him and prince andrew crossing his arms behind him long paced the room now frowning now smiling as he reflected on those irrational inexpressible thoughts secret as a crime which altered his whole life and were connected with pierre with fame with the girl at the window the oak and womans beauty and love and if anyone came into his room at such moments he was particularly cold stern and above all unpleasantly logical my dear princess mary entering at such a moment would say little nicholas
