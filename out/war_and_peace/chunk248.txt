position the emperors remounted and rode away the preobrazhnsk battalion breaking rank mingled with the french guards and sat down at the tables prepared for them lzarev sat in the place of honor russian and french officers embraced him congratulated him and pressed his hands crowds of officers and civilians drew near merely to see him a rumble of russian and french voices and laughter filled the air round the tables in the square two officers with flushed faces looking cheerful and happy passed by rostv what dyou think of the treat all on silver plate one of them was saying have you seen lzarev i have tomorrow i hear the preobrazhnskis will give them a dinner yes but what luck for lzarev twelve hundred francs pension for life heres a cap lads shouted a preobrazhnsk soldier donning a shaggy french cap its a fine thing first-rate have you heard the password asked one guards officer of another the day before yesterday it was napolon france bravoure yesterday alexandre russie grandeur one day our emperor gives it and next day napoleon tomorrow our emperor will send a st georges cross to the bravest of the french guards it has to be done he must respond in kind bors too with his friend zhilnski came to see the preobrazhnsk banquet on his way back he noticed rostv standing by the corner of a house rostv how dyou do we missed one another he said and could not refrain from asking what was the matter so strangely dismal and troubled was rostvs face nothing nothing replied rostv youll call round yes i will rostv stood at that corner for a long time watching the feast from a distance in his mind a painful process was going on which he could not bring to a conclusion terrible doubts rose in his soul now he remembered densov with his changed expression his submission and the whole hospital with arms and legs torn off and its dirt and disease so vividly did he recall that hospital stench of dead flesh that he looked round to see where the smell came from next he thought of that self-satisfied bonaparte with his small white hand who was now an emperor liked and respected by alexander then why those severed arms and legs and those dead men then again he thought of lzarev rewarded and densov punished and unpardoned he caught himself harboring such strange thoughts that he was frightened the smell of the food the preobrazhnskis were eating and a sense of hunger recalled him from these reflections he had to get something to eat before going away he went to a hotel he had noticed that morning there he found so many people among them officers who like himself had come in civilian clothes that he had difficulty in getting a dinner two officers of his own division joined him the conversation naturally turned on the peace the officers his comrades like most of the army were dissatisfied with the peace concluded after the battle of friedland they said that had we held out a little longer napoleon would have been done for as his troops had neither provisions nor ammunition nicholas ate and drank chiefly the latter in silence he finished a couple of bottles of wine by himself the process in his mind went on tormenting him without reaching a conclusion he feared to give way to his thoughts yet could not get rid of them suddenly on one of the officers saying that it was humiliating to look at the french rostv began shouting with uncalled-for wrath and therefore much to the surprise of the officers how can you judge whats best he cried the blood suddenly rushing to his face how can you judge the emperors actions what right have we to argue we cannot comprehend either the emperors aims or his actions but i never said a word about the emperor said the officer justifying himself and unable to understand rostvs outburst except on the supposition that he was drunk but rostv did not listen to him we are not diplomatic officials we are soldiers and nothing more he went on if we are ordered to die we must die if were punished it means that we have deserved it its not for us to judge if the emperor pleases to recognize bonaparte as emperor and to conclude an alliance with him it means that that is the right thing to do if once we begin judging and arguing about everything nothing sacred
