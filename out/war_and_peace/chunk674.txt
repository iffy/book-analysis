must rebuild in moscow why this was necessary he did not know but he knew for certain that it was necessary his income would be reduced by three fourths but he felt it must be done willarski was going to moscow and they agreed to travel together during the whole time of his convalescence in orl pierre had experienced a feeling of joy freedom and life but when during his journey he found himself in the open world and saw hundreds of new faces that feeling was intensified throughout his journey he felt like a schoolboy on holiday everyone the stagecoach driver the post-house overseers the peasants on the roads and in the villages had a new significance for him the presence and remarks of willarski who continually deplored the ignorance and poverty of russia and its backwardness compared with europe only heightened pierres pleasure where willarski saw deadness pierre saw an extraordinary strength and vitality the strength which in that vast space amid the snows maintained the life of this original peculiar and unique people he did not contradict willarski and even seemed to agree with him an apparent agreement being the simplest way to avoid discussions that could lead to nothing and he smiled joyfully as he listened to him chapter xiv it would be difficult to explain why and whither ants whose heap has been destroyed are hurrying some from the heap dragging bits of rubbish larvae and corpses others back to the heap or why they jostle overtake one another and fight and it would be equally difficult to explain what caused the russians after the departure of the french to throng to the place that had formerly been moscow but when we watch the ants round their ruined heap the tenacity energy and immense number of the delving insects prove that despite the destruction of the heap something indestructible which though intangible is the real strength of the colony still exists and similarly though in moscow in the month of october there was no government and no churches shrines riches or houses it was still the moscow it had been in august all was destroyed except something intangible yet powerful and indestructible the motives of those who thronged from all sides to moscow after it had been cleared of the enemy were most diverse and personal and at first for the most part savage and brutal one motive only they all had in common a desire to get to the place that had been called moscow to apply their activities there within a week moscow already had fifteen thousand inhabitants in a fortnight twenty-five thousand and so on by the autumn of the number ever increasing and increasing exceeded what it had been in the first russians to enter moscow were the cossacks of wintzingerodes detachment peasants from the adjacent villages and residents who had fled from moscow and had been hiding in its vicinity the russians who entered moscow finding it plundered plundered it in their turn they continued what the french had begun trains of peasant carts came to moscow to carry off to the villages what had been abandoned in the ruined houses and the streets the cossacks carried off what they could to their camps and the householders seized all they could find in other houses and moved it to their own pretending that it was their property but the first plunderers were followed by a second and a third contingent and with increasing numbers plundering became more and more difficult and assumed more definite forms the french found moscow abandoned but with all the organizations of regular life with diverse branches of commerce and craftsmanship with luxury and governmental and religious institutions these forms were lifeless but still existed there were bazaars shops warehouses market stalls granaries for the most part still stocked with goods and there were factories and workshops palaces and wealthy houses filled with luxuries hospitals prisons government offices churches and cathedrals the longer the french remained the more these forms of town life perished until finally all was merged into one confused lifeless scene of plunder the more the plundering by the french continued the more both the wealth of moscow and the strength of its plunderers was destroyed but plundering by the russians with which the reoccupation of the city began had an opposite effect the longer it continued and the greater the number of people taking part in it the more rapidly was the wealth of the city and its regular life restored besides the plunderers
