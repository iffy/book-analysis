been captured or saved but he saw nothing above him there was now nothing but the sky the lofty sky not clear yet still immeasurably lofty with gray clouds gliding slowly across it how quiet peaceful and solemn not at all as i ran thought prince andrew not as we ran shouting and fighting not at all as the gunner and the frenchman with frightened and angry faces struggled for the mop how differently do those clouds glide across that lofty infinite sky how was it i did not see that lofty sky before and how happy i am to have found it at last yes all is vanity all falsehood except that infinite sky there is nothing nothing but that but even it does not exist there is nothing but quiet and peace thank god chapter xvii on our right flank commanded by bagratin at nine oclock the battle had not yet begun not wishing to agree to dolgorkovs demand to commence the action and wishing to avert responsibility from himself prince bagratin proposed to dolgorkov to send to inquire of the commander in chief bagratin knew that as the distance between the two flanks was more than six miles even if the messenger were not killed which he very likely would be and found the commander in chief which would be very difficult he would not be able to get back before evening bagratin cast his large expressionless sleepy eyes round his suite and the boyish face of rostv breathless with excitement and hope was the first to catch his eye he sent him and if i should meet his majesty before i meet the commander in chief your excellency said rostv with his hand to his cap you can give the message to his majesty said dolgorkov hurriedly interrupting bagratin on being relieved from picket duty rostv had managed to get a few hours sleep before morning and felt cheerful bold and resolute with elasticity of movement faith in his good fortune and generally in that state of mind which makes everything seem possible pleasant and easy all his wishes were being fulfilled that morning there was to be a general engagement in which he was taking part more than that he was orderly to the bravest general and still more he was going with a message to kutzov perhaps even to the sovereign himself the morning was bright he had a good horse under him and his heart was full of joy and happiness on receiving the order he gave his horse the rein and galloped along the line at first he rode along the line of bagratins troops which had not yet advanced into action but were standing motionless then he came to the region occupied by uvrovs cavalry and here he noticed a stir and signs of preparation for battle having passed uvrovs cavalry he clearly heard the sound of cannon and musketry ahead of him the firing grew louder and louder in the fresh morning air were now heard not two or three musket shots at irregular intervals as before followed by one or two cannon shots but a roll of volleys of musketry from the slopes of the hill before pratzen interrupted by such frequent reports of cannon that sometimes several of them were not separated from one another but merged into a general roar he could see puffs of musketry smoke that seemed to chase one another down the hillsides and clouds of cannon smoke rolling spreading and mingling with one another he could also by the gleam of bayonets visible through the smoke make out moving masses of infantry and narrow lines of artillery with green caissons rostv stopped his horse for a moment on a hillock to see what was going on but strain his attention as he would he could not understand or make out anything of what was happening there in the smoke men of some sort were moving about in front and behind moved lines of troops but why whither and who they were it was impossible to make out these sights and sounds had no depressing or intimidating effect on him on the contrary they stimulated his energy and determination go on go on give it them he mentally exclaimed at these sounds and again proceeded to gallop along the line penetrating farther and farther into the region where the army was already in action how it will be there i dont know but all will be well thought rostv after passing some austrian troops he noticed
