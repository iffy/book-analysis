the danger continued while steadily melting away to pursue its fatal path to smolnsk book fourteen chapter i the battle of borodin with the occupation of moscow that followed it and the flight of the french without further conflicts is one of the most instructive phenomena in history all historians agree that the external activity of states and nations in their conflicts with one another is expressed in wars and that as a direct result of greater or less success in war the political strength of states and nations increases or decreases strange as may be the historical account of how some king or emperor having quarreled with another collects an army fights his enemys army gains a victory by killing three five or ten thousand men and subjugates a kingdom and an entire nation of several millions all the facts of history as far as we know it confirm the truth of the statement that the greater or lesser success of one army against another is the cause or at least an essential indication of an increase or decrease in the strength of the nation even though it is unintelligible why the defeat of an army a hundredth part of a nation should oblige that whole nation to submit an army gains a victory and at once the rights of the conquering nation have increased to the detriment of the defeated an army has suffered defeat and at once a people loses its rights in proportion to the severity of the reverse and if its army suffers a complete defeat the nation is quite subjugated so according to history it has been found from the most ancient times and so it is to our own day all napoleons wars serve to confirm this rule in proportion to the defeat of the austrian army austria loses its rights and the rights and the strength of france increase the victories of the french at jena and auerstdt destroy the independent existence of prussia but then in the french gain a victory near moscow moscow is taken and after that with no further battles it is not russia that ceases to exist but the french army of six hundred thousand and then napoleonic france itself to strain the facts to fit the rules of history to say that the field of battle at borodin remained in the hands of the russians or that after moscow there were other battles that destroyed napoleons army is impossible after the french victory at borodin there was no general engagement nor any that were at all serious yet the french army ceased to exist what does this mean if it were an example taken from the history of china we might say that it was not an historic phenomenon which is the historians usual expedient when anything does not fit their standards if the matter concerned some brief conflict in which only a small number of troops took part we might treat it as an exception but this event occurred before our fathers eyes and for them it was a question of the life or death of their fatherland and it happened in the greatest of all known wars the period of the campaign of from the battle of borodin to the expulsion of the french proved that the winning of a battle does not produce a conquest and is not even an invariable indication of conquest it proved that the force which decides the fate of peoples lies not in the conquerors nor even in armies and battles but in something else the french historians describing the condition of the french army before it left moscow affirm that all was in order in the grand army except the cavalry the artillery and the transport there was no forage for the horses or the cattle that was a misfortune no one could remedy for the peasants of the district burned their hay rather than let the french have it the victory gained did not bring the usual results because the peasants karp and vlas who after the french had evacuated moscow drove in their carts to pillage the town and in general personally failed to manifest any heroic feelings and the whole innumerable multitude of such peasants did not bring their hay to moscow for the high price offered them but burned it instead let us imagine two men who have come out to fight a duel with rapiers according to all the rules of the art of fencing the fencing has gone on for some time suddenly
