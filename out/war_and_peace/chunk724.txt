country but not to mention the historians contradictions as to the nature of this program or even admitting that some one general program of these conditions exists the facts of history almost always contradict that theory if the conditions under which power is entrusted consist in the wealth freedom and enlightenment of the people how is it that louis xiv and ivn the terrible end their reigns tranquilly while louis xvi and charles i are executed by their people to this question historians reply that louis xivs activity contrary to the program reacted on louis xvi but why did it not react on louis xiv or on louis xv why should it react just on louis xvi and what is the time limit for such reactions to these questions there are and can be no answers equally little does this view explain why for several centuries the collective will is not withdrawn from certain rulers and their heirs and then suddenly during a period of fifty years is transferred to the convention to the directory to napoleon to alexander to louis xviii to napoleon again to charles x to louis philippe to a republican government and to napoleon iii when explaining these rapid transfers of the peoples will from one individual to another especially in view of international relations conquests and alliances the historians are obliged to admit that some of these transfers are not normal delegations of the peoples will but are accidents dependent on cunning on mistakes on craft or on the weakness of a diplomatist a ruler or a party leader so that the greater part of the events of history civil wars revolutions and conquests are presented by these historians not as the results of free transferences of the peoples will but as results of the ill-directed will of one or more individuals that is once again as usurpations of power and so these historians also see and admit historical events which are exceptions to the theory these historians resemble a botanist who having noticed that some plants grow from seeds producing two cotyledons should insist that all that grows does so by sprouting into two leaves and that the palm the mushroom and even the oak which blossom into full growth and no longer resemble two leaves are deviations from the theory historians of the third class assume that the will of the people is transferred to historic personages conditionally but that the conditions are unknown to us they say that historical personages have power only because they fulfill the will of the people which has been delegated to them but in that case if the force that moves nations lies not in the historic leaders but in the nations themselves what significance have those leaders the leaders these historians tell us express the will of the people the activity of the leaders represents the activity of the people but in that case the question arises whether all the activity of the leaders serves as an expression of the peoples will or only some part of it if the whole activity of the leaders serves as the expression of the peoples will as some historians suppose then all the details of the court scandals contained in the biographies of a napoleon or a catherine serve to express the life of the nation which is evident nonsense but if it is only some particular side of the activity of an historical leader which serves to express the peoples life as other so-called philosophical historians believe then to determine which side of the activity of a leader expresses the nations life we have first of all to know in what the nations life consists met by this difficulty historians of that class devise some most obscure impalpable and general abstraction which can cover all conceivable occurrences and declare this abstraction to be the aim of humanitys movement the most usual generalizations adopted by almost all the historians are freedom equality enlightenment progress civilization and culture postulating some generalization as the goal of the movement of humanity the historians study the men of whom the greatest number of monuments have remained kings ministers generals authors reformers popes and journalists to the extent to which in their opinion these persons have promoted or hindered that abstraction but as it is in no way proved that the aim of humanity does consist in freedom equality enlightenment or civilization and as the connection of the people with the rulers and enlighteners of humanity is only based on the arbitrary assumption that the collective
