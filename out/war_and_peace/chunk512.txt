in his carriage chapter ix scarcely had pierre laid his head on the pillow before he felt himself falling asleep but suddenly almost with the distinctness of reality he heard the boom boom boom of firing the thud of projectiles groans and cries and smelled blood and powder and a feeling of horror and dread of death seized him filled with fright he opened his eyes and lifted his head from under his cloak all was tranquil in the yard only someones orderly passed through the gateway splashing through the mud and talked to the innkeeper above pierres head some pigeons disturbed by the movement he had made in sitting up fluttered under the dark roof of the penthouse the whole courtyard was permeated by a strong peaceful smell of stable yards delightful to pierre at that moment he could see the clear starry sky between the dark roofs of two penthouses thank god there is no more of that he thought covering up his head again oh what a terrible thing is fear and how shamefully i yielded to it but they they were steady and calm all the time to the end thought he they in pierres mind were the soldiers those who had been at the battery those who had given him food and those who had prayed before the icon they those strange men he had not previously known stood out clearly and sharply from everyone else to be a soldier just a soldier thought pierre as he fell asleep to enter communal life completely to be imbued by what makes them what they are but how to cast off all the superfluous devilish burden of my outer man there was a time when i could have done it i could have run away from my father as i wanted to or i might have been sent to serve as a soldier after the duel with dlokhov and the memory of the dinner at the english club when he had challenged dlokhov flashed through pierres mind and then he remembered his benefactor at torzhk and now a picture of a solemn meeting of the lodge presented itself to his mind it was taking place at the english club and someone near and dear to him sat at the end of the table yes that is he it is my benefactor but he died thought pierre yes he died and i did not know he was alive how sorry i am that he died and how glad i am that he is alive again on one side of the table sat anatole dlokhov nesvtski densov and others like them in his dream the category to which these men belonged was as clearly defined in his mind as the category of those he termed they and he heard those people anatole and dlokhov shouting and singing loudly yet through their shouting the voice of his benefactor was heard speaking all the time and the sound of his words was as weighty and uninterrupted as the booming on the battlefield but pleasant and comforting pierre did not understand what his benefactor was saying but he knew the categories of thoughts were also quite distinct in his dream that he was talking of goodness and the possibility of being what they were and they with their simple kind firm faces surrounded his benefactor on all sides but though they were kindly they did not look at pierre and did not know him wishing to speak and to attract their attention he got up but at that moment his legs grew cold and bare he felt ashamed and with one arm covered his legs from which his cloak had in fact slipped for a moment as he was rearranging his cloak pierre opened his eyes and saw the same penthouse roofs posts and yard but now they were all bluish lit up and glittering with frost or dew it is dawn thought pierre but thats not what i want i want to hear and understand my benefactors words again he covered himself up with his cloak but now neither the lodge nor his benefactor was there there were only thoughts clearly expressed in words thoughts that someone was uttering or that he himself was formulating afterwards when he recalled those thoughts pierre was convinced that someone outside himself had spoken them though the impressions of that day had evoked them he had never it seemed to him been able to think and express his thoughts like that when awake to endure war is
