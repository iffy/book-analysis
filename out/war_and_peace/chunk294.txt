implore you come at once if you do not wish to make me and the whole family wretched wrote the countess this letter touched nicholas he had that common sense of a matter-of-fact man which showed him what he ought to do the right thing now was if not to retire from the service at any rate to go home on leave why he had to go he did not know but after his after-dinner nap he gave orders to saddle mars an extremely vicious gray stallion that had not been ridden for a long time and when he returned with the horse all in a lather he informed lavrshka densovs servant who had remained with him and his comrades who turned up in the evening that he was applying for leave and was going home difficult and strange as it was for him to reflect that he would go away without having heard from the staff and this interested him extremely whether he was promoted to a captaincy or would receive the order of st anne for the last maneuvers strange as it was to think that he would go away without having sold his three roans to the polish count golukhovski who was bargaining for the horses rostv had betted he would sell for two thousand rubles incomprehensible as it seemed that the ball the hussars were giving in honor of the polish mademoiselle przazdziecka out of rivalry to the uhlans who had given one in honor of their polish mademoiselle borzozowska would take place without him he knew he must go away from this good bright world to somewhere where everything was stupid and confused a week later he obtained his leave his hussar comrades not only those of his own regiment but the whole brigade gave rostv a dinner to which the subscription was fifteen rubles a head and at which there were two bands and two choirs of singers rostv danced the trepk with major bsov the tipsy officers tossed embraced and dropped rostv the soldiers of the third squadron tossed him too and shouted hurrah and then they put him in his sleigh and escorted him as far as the first post station during the first half of the journey from kremenchg to kiev all rostvs thoughts as is usual in such cases were behind him with the squadron but when he had gone more than halfway he began to forget his three roans and dozhoyvyko his quartermaster and to wonder anxiously how things would be at otrdnoe and what he would find there thoughts of home grew stronger the nearer he approached it far stronger as though this feeling of his was subject to the law by which the force of attraction is in inverse proportion to the square of the distance at the last post station before otrdnoe he gave the driver a three-ruble tip and on arriving he ran breathlessly like a boy up the steps of his home after the rapture of meeting and after that odd feeling of unsatisfied expectation the feeling that everything is just the same so why did i hurry nicholas began to settle down in his old home world his father and mother were much the same only a little older what was new in them was a certain uneasiness and occasional discord which there used not to be and which as nicholas soon found out was due to the bad state of their affairs snya was nearly twenty she had stopped growing prettier and promised nothing more than she was already but that was enough she exhaled happiness and love from the time nicholas returned and the faithful unalterable love of this girl had a gladdening effect on him ptya and natsha surprised nicholas most ptya was a big handsome boy of thirteen merry witty and mischievous with a voice that was already breaking as for natsha for a long while nicholas wondered and laughed whenever he looked at her youre not the same at all he said how am i uglier on the contrary but what dignity a princess he whispered to her yes yes yes cried natsha joyfully she told him about her romance with prince andrew and of his visit to otrdnoe and showed him his last letter well are you glad natsha asked i am so tranquil and happy now very glad answered nicholas he is an excellent fellow and are you very much in love how shall i put it replied natsha i was in love with bors with my teacher
