before but it is a good thing for proprietors who perish morally bring remorse upon themselves stifle this remorse and grow callous as a result of being able to inflict punishments justly and unjustly it is those people i pity and for their sake i should like to liberate the serfs you may not have seen but i have seen how good men brought up in those traditions of unlimited power in time when they grow more irritable become cruel and harsh are conscious of it but cannot restrain themselves and grow more and more miserable prince andrew spoke so earnestly that pierre could not help thinking that these thoughts had been suggested to prince andrew by his fathers case he did not reply so thats what im sorry for human dignity peace of mind purity and not the serfs backs and foreheads which beat and shave as you may always remain the same backs and foreheads no no a thousand times no i shall never agree with you said pierre chapter xii in the evening andrew and pierre got into the open carriage and drove to bald hills prince andrew glancing at pierre broke the silence now and then with remarks which showed that he was in a good temper pointing to the fields he spoke of the improvements he was making in his husbandry pierre remained gloomily silent answering in monosyllables and apparently immersed in his own thoughts he was thinking that prince andrew was unhappy had gone astray did not see the true light and that he pierre ought to aid enlighten and raise him but as soon as he thought of what he should say he felt that prince andrew with one word one argument would upset all his teaching and he shrank from beginning afraid of exposing to possible ridicule what to him was precious and sacred no but why do you think so pierre suddenly began lowering his head and looking like a bull about to charge why do you think so you should not think so think what about asked prince andrew with surprise about life about mans destiny it cant be so i myself thought like that and do you know what saved me freemasonry no dont smile freemasonry is not a religious ceremonial sect as i thought it was freemasonry is the best expression of the best the eternal aspects of humanity and he began to explain freemasonry as he understood it to prince andrew he said that freemasonry is the teaching of christianity freed from the bonds of state and church a teaching of equality brotherhood and love only our holy brotherhood has the real meaning of life all the rest is a dream said pierre understand my dear fellow that outside this union all is filled with deceit and falsehood and i agree with you that nothing is left for an intelligent and good man but to live out his life like you merely trying not to harm others but make our fundamental convictions your own join our brotherhood give yourself up to us let yourself be guided and you will at once feel yourself as i have felt myself a part of that vast invisible chain the beginning of which is hidden in heaven said pierre prince andrew looking straight in front of him listened in silence to pierres words more than once when the noise of the wheels prevented his catching what pierre said he asked him to repeat it and by the peculiar glow that came into prince andrews eyes and by his silence pierre saw that his words were not in vain and that prince andrew would not interrupt him or laugh at what he said they reached a river that had overflowed its banks and which they had to cross by ferry while the carriage and horses were being placed on it they also stepped on the raft prince andrew leaning his arms on the raft railing gazed silently at the flooding waters glittering in the setting sun well what do you think about it pierre asked why are you silent what do i think about it i am listening to you its all very well you say join our brotherhood and we will show you the aim of life the destiny of man and the laws which govern the world but who are we men how is it you know everything why do i alone not see what you see you see a reign of goodness and truth on earth but i dont see it
