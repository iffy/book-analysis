living that is to use her vital forces a peculiarity one sees in very young children and very old people was particularly evident in her her life had no external aims only a need to exercise her various functions and inclinations was apparent she had to eat sleep think speak weep work give vent to her anger and so on merely because she had a stomach a brain muscles nerves and a liver she did these things not under any external impulse as people in the full vigor of life do when behind the purpose for which they strive that of exercising their functions remains unnoticed she talked only because she physically needed to exercise her tongue and lungs she cried as a child does because her nose had to be cleared and so on what for people in their full vigor is an aim was for her evidently merely a pretext thus in the morning especially if she had eaten anything rich the day before she felt a need of being angry and would choose as the handiest pretext belvas deafness she would begin to say something to her in a low tone from the other end of the room it seems a little warmer today my dear she would murmur and when belva replied oh yes theyve come she would mutter angrily o lord how stupid and deaf she is another pretext would be her snuff which would seem too dry or too damp or not rubbed fine enough after these fits of irritability her face would grow yellow and her maids knew by infallible symptoms when belva would again be deaf the snuff damp and the countess face yellow just as she needed to work off her spleen so she had sometimes to exercise her still-existing faculty of thinking and the pretext for that was a game of patience when she needed to cry the deceased count would be the pretext when she wanted to be agitated nicholas and his health would be the pretext and when she felt a need to speak spitefully the pretext would be countess mary when her vocal organs needed exercise which was usually toward seven oclock when she had had an after-dinner rest in a darkened room the pretext would be the retelling of the same stories over and over again to the same audience the old ladys condition was understood by the whole household though no one ever spoke of it and they all made every possible effort to satisfy her needs only by a rare glance exchanged with a sad smile between nicholas pierre natsha and countess mary was the common understanding of her condition expressed but those glances expressed something more they said that she had played her part in life that what they now saw was not her whole self that we must all become like her and that they were glad to yield to her to restrain themselves for this once precious being formerly as full of life as themselves but now so much to be pitied memento mori said these glances only the really heartless the stupid ones of that household and the little children failed to understand this and avoided her chapter xiii when pierre and his wife entered the drawing room the countess was in one of her customary states in which she needed the mental exertion of playing patience and so though by force of habit she greeted him with the words she always used when pierre or her son returned after an absence high time my dear high time we were all weary of waiting for you well thank god and received her presents with another customary remark its not the gift thats precious my dear but that you give it to me an old woman yet it was evident that she was not pleased by pierres arrival at that moment when it diverted her attention from the unfinished game she finished her game of patience and only then examined the presents they consisted of a box for cards of splendid workmanship a bright-blue svres tea cup with shepherdesses depicted on it and with a lid and a gold snuffbox with the counts portrait on the lid which pierre had had done by a miniaturist in petersburg the countess had long wished for such a box but as she did not want to cry just then she glanced indifferently at the portrait and gave her attention chiefly to the box for cards thank you my dear you have cheered me up said she
