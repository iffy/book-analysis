they were quartered braunau was the headquarters of the commander in chief kutzov on october one of the infantry regiments that had just reached braunau had halted half a mile from the town waiting to be inspected by the commander in chief despite the un-russian appearance of the locality and surroundings fruit gardens stone fences tiled roofs and hills in the distance and despite the fact that the inhabitants who gazed with curiosity at the soldiers were not russians the regiment had just the appearance of any russian regiment preparing for an inspection anywhere in the heart of russia on the evening of the last days march an order had been received that the commander in chief would inspect the regiment on the march though the words of the order were not clear to the regimental commander and the question arose whether the troops were to be in marching order or not it was decided at a consultation between the battalion commanders to present the regiment in parade order on the principle that it is always better to bow too low than not bow low enough so the soldiers after a twenty-mile march were kept mending and cleaning all night long without closing their eyes while the adjutants and company commanders calculated and reckoned and by morning the regiment instead of the straggling disorderly crowd it had been on its last march the day before presented a well-ordered array of two thousand men each of whom knew his place and his duty had every button and every strap in place and shone with cleanliness and not only externally was all in order but had it pleased the commander in chief to look under the uniforms he would have found on every man a clean shirt and in every knapsack the appointed number of articles awl soap and all as the soldiers say there was only one circumstance concerning which no one could be at ease it was the state of the soldiers boots more than half the mens boots were in holes but this defect was not due to any fault of the regimental commander for in spite of repeated demands boots had not been issued by the austrian commissariat and the regiment had marched some seven hundred miles the commander of the regiment was an elderly choleric stout and thick-set general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers and wider from chest to back than across the shoulders he had on a brand-new uniform showing the creases where it had been folded and thick gold epaulettes which seemed to stand rather than lie down on his massive shoulders he had the air of a man happily performing one of the most solemn duties of his life he walked about in front of the line and at every step pulled himself up slightly arching his back it was plain that the commander admired his regiment rejoiced in it and that his whole mind was engrossed by it yet his strut seemed to indicate that besides military matters social interests and the fair sex occupied no small part of his thoughts well michael mtrich sir he said addressing one of the battalion commanders who smilingly pressed forward it was plain that they both felt happy we had our hands full last night however i think the regiment is not a bad one eh the battalion commander perceived the jovial irony and laughed it would not be turned off the field even on the tsartsin meadow what asked the commander at that moment on the road from the town on which signalers had been posted two men appeared on horse back they were an aide-de-camp followed by a cossack the aide-de-camp was sent to confirm the order which had not been clearly worded the day before namely that the commander in chief wished to see the regiment just in the state in which it had been on the march in their greatcoats and packs and without any preparation whatever a member of the hofkriegsrath from vienna had come to kutzov the day before with proposals and demands for him to join up with the army of the archduke ferdinand and mack and kutzov not considering this junction advisable meant among other arguments in support of his view to show the austrian general the wretched state in which the troops arrived from russia with this object he intended to meet the regiment so the worse the condition it was in the better pleased the commander in chief would be though the aide-de-camp did not know these circumstances he
