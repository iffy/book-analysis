of power for true gold power is the collective will of the people transferred by expressed or tacit consent to their chosen rulers in the domain of jurisprudence which consists of discussions of how a state and power might be arranged were it possible for all that to be arranged it is all very clear but when applied to history that definition of power needs explanation the science of jurisprudence regards the state and power as the ancients regarded fire namely as something existing absolutely but for history the state and power are merely phenomena just as for modern physics fire is not an element but a phenomenon from this fundamental difference between the view held by history and that held by jurisprudence it follows that jurisprudence can tell minutely how in its opinion power should be constituted and what power existing immutably outside time is but to historys questions about the meaning of the mutations of power in time it can answer nothing if power be the collective will of the people transferred to their ruler was pugachv a representative of the will of the people if not then why was napoleon i why was napoleon iii a criminal when he was taken prisoner at boulogne and why later on were those criminals whom he arrested do palace revolutions in which sometimes only two or three people take part transfer the will of the people to a new ruler in international relations is the will of the people also transferred to their conqueror was the will of the confederation of the rhine transferred to napoleon in was the will of the russian people transferred to napoleon in when our army in alliance with the french went to fight the austrians to these questions three answers are possible either to assume that the will of the people is always unconditionally transferred to the ruler or rulers they have chosen and that therefore every emergence of a new power every struggle against the power once appointed should be absolutely regarded as an infringement of the real power or that the will of the people is transferred to the rulers conditionally under definite and known conditions and to show that all limitations conflicts and even destructions of power result from a nonobservance by the rulers of the conditions under which their power was entrusted to them or that the will of the people is delegated to the rulers conditionally but that the conditions are unknown and indefinite and that the appearance of several authorities their struggles and their falls result solely from the greater or lesser fulfillment by the rulers of these unknown conditions on which the will of the people is transferred from some people to others and these are the three ways in which the historians do explain the relation of the people to their rulers some historians those biographical and specialist historians already referred to in their simplicity failing to understand the question of the meaning of power seem to consider that the collective will of the people is unconditionally transferred to historical persons and therefore when describing some single state they assume that particular power to be the one absolute and real power and that any other force opposing this is not a power but a violation of power mere violence their theory suitable for primitive and peaceful periods of history has the inconvenience in application to complex and stormy periods in the life of nations during which various powers arise simultaneously and struggle with one another that a legitimist historian will prove that the national convention the directory and bonaparte were mere infringers of the true power while a republican and a bonapartist will prove the one that the convention and the other that the empire was the real power and that all the others were violations of power evidently the explanations furnished by these historians being mutually contradictory can only satisfy young children recognizing the falsity of this view of history another set of historians say that power rests on a conditional delegation of the will of the people to their rulers and that historical leaders have power only conditionally on carrying out the program that the will of the people has by tacit agreement prescribed to them but what this program consists in these historians do not say or if they do they continually contradict one another each historian according to his view of what constitutes a nations progress looks for these conditions in the greatness wealth freedom or enlightenment of citizens of france or some other
