and gesticulating england is done for said he scowling and pointing his finger at someone unseen mr pitt as a traitor to the nation and to the rights of man is sentenced to but before pierre who at that moment imagined himself to be napoleon in person and to have just effected the dangerous crossing of the straits of dover and captured london could pronounce pitts sentence he saw a well-built and handsome young officer entering his room pierre paused he had left moscow when bors was a boy of fourteen and had quite forgotten him but in his usual impulsive and hearty way he took bors by the hand with a friendly smile do you remember me asked bors quietly with a pleasant smile i have come with my mother to see the count but it seems he is not well yes it seems he is ill people are always disturbing him answered pierre trying to remember who this young man was bors felt that pierre did not recognize him but did not consider it necessary to introduce himself and without experiencing the least embarrassment looked pierre straight in the face count rostv asks you to come to dinner today said he after a considerable pause which made pierre feel uncomfortable ah count rostv exclaimed pierre joyfully then you are his son ily only fancy i didnt know you at first do you remember how we went to the sparrow hills with madame jacquot its such an age you are mistaken said bors deliberately with a bold and slightly sarcastic smile i am bors son of princess anna mikhylovna drubetskya rostv the father is ily and his son is nicholas i never knew any madame jacquot pierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or bees oh dear what am i thinking about ive mixed everything up one has so many relatives in moscow so you are bors of course well now we know where we are and what do you think of the boulogne expedition the english will come off badly you know if napoleon gets across the channel i think the expedition is quite feasible if only villeneuve doesnt make a mess of things bors knew nothing about the boulogne expedition he did not read the papers and it was the first time he had heard villeneuves name we here in moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandal than with politics said he in his quiet ironical tone i know nothing about it and have not thought about it moscow is chiefly busy with gossip he continued just now they are talking about you and your father pierre smiled in his good-natured way as if afraid for his companions sake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regret but bors spoke distinctly clearly and dryly looking straight into pierres eyes moscow has nothing else to do but gossip bors went on everybody is wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune though he may perhaps outlive us all as i sincerely hope he will yes it is all very horrid interrupted pierre very horrid pierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say something disconcerting to himself and it must seem to you said bors flushing slightly but not changing his tone or attitude it must seem to you that everyone is trying to get something out of the rich man so it does thought pierre but i just wish to say to avoid misunderstandings that you are quite mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people we are very poor but for my own part at any rate for the very reason that your father is rich i dont regard myself as a relation of his and neither i nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from him for a long time pierre could not understand but when he did he jumped up from the sofa seized bors under the elbow in his quick clumsy way and blushing far more than bors began to speak with a feeling of mingled shame and vexation well this is strange do you suppose i who could think i know very well but bors again interrupted him i am glad i have spoken out fully perhaps you did not like it you must excuse me said he putting pierre at ease instead of being put at ease by him but i hope i have not offended you i always make it a rule to speak out well what answer
