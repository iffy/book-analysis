as experience shows that a three-mile movement of columns on a battlefield never coincides with the plans the probability of chichagv kutzov and wittgenstein effecting a junction on time at an appointed place was so remote as to be tantamount to impossibility as in fact thought kutzov who when he received the plan remarked that diversions planned over great distances do not yield the desired results secondly it was impossible because to paralyze the momentum with which napoleons army was retiring incomparably greater forces than the russians possessed would have been required thirdly it was impossible because the military term to cut off has no meaning one can cut off a slice of bread but not an army to cut off an army to bar its road is quite impossible for there is always plenty of room to avoid capture and there is the night when nothing can be seen as the military scientists might convince themselves by the example of krsnoe and of the berzina it is only possible to capture prisoners if they agree to be captured just as it is only possible to catch a swallow if it settles on ones hand men can only be taken prisoners if they surrender according to the rules of strategy and tactics as the germans did but the french troops quite rightly did not consider that this suited them since death by hunger and cold awaited them in flight or captivity alike fourthly and chiefly it was impossible because never since the world began has a war been fought under such conditions as those that obtained in and the russian army in its pursuit of the french strained its strength to the utmost and could not have done more without destroying itself during the movement of the russian army from tartino to krsnoe it lost fifty thousand sick or stragglers that is a number equal to the population of a large provincial town half the men fell out of the army without a battle and it is of this period of the campaign when the army lacked boots and sheepskin coats was short of provisions and without vodka and was camping out at night for months in the snow with fifteen degrees of frost when there were only seven or eight hours of daylight and the rest was night in which the influence of discipline cannot be maintained when men were taken into that region of death where discipline fails not for a few hours only as in a battle but for months where they were every moment fighting death from hunger and cold when half the army perished in a single month it is of this period of the campaign that the historians tell us how milordovich should have made a flank march to such and such a place tormsov to another place and chichagv should have crossed more than knee-deep in snow to somewhere else and how so-and-so routed and cut off the french and so on and so on the russians half of whom died did all that could and should have been done to attain an end worthy of the nation and they are not to blame because other russians sitting in warm rooms proposed that they should do what was impossible all that strange contradiction now difficult to understand between the facts and the historical accounts only arises because the historians dealing with the matter have written the history of the beautiful words and sentiments of various generals and not the history of the events to them the words of milordovich seem very interesting and so do their surmises and the rewards this or that general received but the question of those fifty thousand men who were left in hospitals and in graves does not even interest them for it does not come within the range of their investigation yet one need only discard the study of the reports and general plans and consider the movement of those hundreds of thousands of men who took a direct part in the events and all the questions that seemed insoluble easily and simply receive an immediate and certain solution the aim of cutting off napoleon and his army never existed except in the imaginations of a dozen people it could not exist because it was senseless and unattainable the people had a single aim to free their land from invasion that aim was attained in the first place of itself as the french ran away and so it was only necessary not to stop their flight secondly it was
