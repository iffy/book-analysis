again later on it will do no harm but as things are now one cant answer for anything but you see what he writes said another pointing to a printed sheet he held in his hand thats another matter thats necessary for the people said the first what is it asked pierre oh its a fresh broadsheet pierre took it and began reading his serene highness has passed through mozhysk in order to join up with the troops moving toward him and has taken up a strong position where the enemy will not soon attack him forty-eight guns with ammunition have been sent him from here and his serene highness says he will defend moscow to the last drop of blood and is even ready to fight in the streets do not be upset brothers that the law courts are closed things have to be put in order and we will deal with villains in our own way when the time comes i shall want both town and peasant lads and will raise the cry a day or two beforehand but they are not wanted yet so i hold my peace an ax will be useful a hunting spear not bad but a three-pronged fork will be best of all a frenchman is no heavier than a sheaf of rye tomorrow after dinner i shall take the iberian icon of the mother of god to the wounded in the catherine hospital where we will have some water blessed that will help them to get well quicker i too am well now one of my eyes was sore but now i am on the lookout with both but military men have told me that it is impossible to fight in the town said pierre and that the position well of course thats what we were saying replied the first speaker and what does he mean by one of my eyes was sore but now i am on the lookout with both asked pierre the count had a sty replied the adjutant smiling and was very much upset when i told him people had come to ask what was the matter with him by the by count he added suddenly addressing pierre with a smile we heard that you have family troubles and that the countess your wife i have heard nothing pierre replied unconcernedly but what have you heard oh well you know people often invent things i only say what i heard but what did you hear well they say continued the adjutant with the same smile that the countess your wife is preparing to go abroad i expect its nonsense possibly remarked pierre looking about him absent-mindedly and who is that he asked indicating a short old man in a clean blue peasant overcoat with a big snow-white beard and eyebrows and a ruddy face he thats a tradesman that is to say hes the restaurant keeper vereshchgin perhaps you have heard of that affair with the proclamation oh so that is vereshchgin said pierre looking at the firm calm face of the old man and seeking any indication of his being a traitor thats not he himself thats the father of the fellow who wrote the proclamation said the adjutant the young man is in prison and i expect it will go hard with him an old gentleman wearing a star and another official a german wearing a cross round his neck approached the speaker its a complicated story you know said the adjutant that proclamation appeared about two months ago the count was informed of it he gave orders to investigate the matter gabriel ivnovich here made the inquiries the proclamation had passed through exactly sixty-three hands he asked one from whom did you get it from so-and-so he went to the next one from whom did you get it and so on till he reached vereshchgin a half educated tradesman you know a pet of a trader said the adjutant smiling they asked him who gave it you and the point is that we knew whom he had it from he could only have had it from the postmaster but evidently they had come to some understanding he replied from no one i made it up myself they threatened and questioned him but he stuck to that i made it up myself and so it was reported to the count who sent for the man from whom did you get the proclamation i wrote it myself well you know the count said the adjutant cheerfully with a smile
