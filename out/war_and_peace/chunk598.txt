till it was finished soon he really shut his eyes and fell asleep he did not sleep long and suddenly awoke with a start and in a cold perspiration as he fell asleep he had still been thinking of the subject that now always occupied his mind about life and death and chiefly about death he felt himself nearer to it love what is love he thought love hinders death love is life all everything that i understand i understand only because i love everything is everything exists only because i love everything is united by it alone love is god and to die means that i a particle of love shall return to the general and eternal source these thoughts seemed to him comforting but they were only thoughts something was lacking in them they were not clear they were too one-sidedly personal and brain-spun and there was the former agitation and obscurity he fell asleep he dreamed that he was lying in the room he really was in but that he was quite well and unwounded many various indifferent and insignificant people appeared before him he talked to them and discussed something trivial they were preparing to go away somewhere prince andrew dimly realized that all this was trivial and that he had more important cares but he continued to speak surprising them by empty witticisms gradually unnoticed all these persons began to disappear and a single question that of the closed door superseded all else he rose and went to the door to bolt and lock it everything depended on whether he was or was not in time to lock it he went and tried to hurry but his legs refused to move and he knew he would not be in time to lock the door though he painfully strained all his powers he was seized by an agonizing fear and that fear was the fear of death it stood behind the door but just when he was clumsily creeping toward the door that dreadful something on the other side was already pressing against it and forcing its way in something not human death was breaking in through that door and had to be kept out he seized the door making a final effort to hold it back to lock it was no longer possible but his efforts were weak and clumsy and the door pushed from behind by that terror opened and closed again once again it pushed from outside his last superhuman efforts were vain and both halves of the door noiselessly opened it entered and it was death and prince andrew died but at the instant he died prince andrew remembered that he was asleep and at the very instant he died having made an effort he awoke yes it was death i died and woke up yes death is an awakening and all at once it grew light in his soul and the veil that had till then concealed the unknown was lifted from his spiritual vision he felt as if powers till then confined within him had been liberated and that strange lightness did not again leave him when waking in a cold perspiration he moved on the divan natsha went up and asked him what was the matter he did not answer and looked at her strangely not understanding that was what had happened to him two days before princess marys arrival from that day as the doctor expressed it the wasting fever assumed a malignant character but what the doctor said did not interest natsha she saw the terrible moral symptoms which to her were more convincing from that day an awakening from life came to prince andrew together with his awakening from sleep and compared to the duration of life it did not seem to him slower than an awakening from sleep compared to the duration of a dream there was nothing terrible or violent in this comparatively slow awakening his last days and hours passed in an ordinary and simple way both princess mary and natsha who did not leave him felt this they did not weep or shudder and during these last days they themselves felt that they were not attending on him he was no longer there he had left them but on what reminded them most closely of him his body both felt this so strongly that the outward and terrible side of death did not affect them and they did not feel it necessary to foment their grief neither in his presence nor out of it
