woke up coughed heavily and looked round at the generals gentlemen the dispositions for tomorrow or rather for today for it is past midnight cannot now be altered said he you have heard them and we shall all do our duty but before a battle there is nothing more important he paused than to have a good sleep he moved as if to rise the generals bowed and retired it was past midnight prince andrew went out the council of war at which prince andrew had not been able to express his opinion as he had hoped to left on him a vague and uneasy impression whether dolgorkov and weyrother or kutzov langeron and the others who did not approve of the plan of attack were right he did not know but was it really not possible for kutzov to state his views plainly to the emperor is it possible that on account of court and personal considerations tens of thousands of lives and my life my life he thought must be risked yes it is very likely that i shall be killed tomorrow he thought and suddenly at this thought of death a whole series of most distant most intimate memories rose in his imagination he remembered his last parting from his father and his wife he remembered the days when he first loved her he thought of her pregnancy and felt sorry for her and for himself and in a nervously emotional and softened mood he went out of the hut in which he was billeted with nesvtski and began to walk up and down before it the night was foggy and through the fog the moonlight gleamed mysteriously yes tomorrow tomorrow he thought tomorrow everything may be over for me all these memories will be no more none of them will have any meaning for me tomorrow perhaps even certainly i have a presentiment that for the first time i shall have to show all i can do and his fancy pictured the battle its loss the concentration of fighting at one point and the hesitation of all the commanders and then that happy moment that toulon for which he had so long waited presents itself to him at last he firmly and clearly expresses his opinion to kutzov to weyrother and to the emperors all are struck by the justness of his views but no one undertakes to carry them out so he takes a regiment a division stipulates that no one is to interfere with his arrangements leads his division to the decisive point and gains the victory alone but death and suffering suggested another voice prince andrew however did not answer that voice and went on dreaming of his triumphs the dispositions for the next battle are planned by him alone nominally he is only an adjutant on kutzovs staff but he does everything alone the next battle is won by him alone kutzov is removed and he is appointed well and then asked the other voice if before that you are not ten times wounded killed or betrayed well what then well then prince andrew answered himself i dont know what will happen and dont want to know and cant but if i want this want glory want to be known to men want to be loved by them it is not my fault that i want it and want nothing but that and live only for that yes for that alone i shall never tell anyone but oh god what am i to do if i love nothing but fame and mens esteem death wounds the loss of family i fear nothing and precious and dear as many persons are to me father sister wife those dearest to me yet dreadful and unnatural as it seems i would give them all at once for a moment of glory of triumph over men of love from men i dont know and never shall know for the love of these men here he thought as he listened to voices in kutzovs courtyard the voices were those of the orderlies who were packing up one voice probably a coachmans was teasing kutzovs old cook whom prince andrew knew and who was called tit he was saying tit i say tit well returned the old man go tit thresh a bit said the wag oh go to the devil called out a voice drowned by the laughter of the orderlies and servants all the same i love and value nothing but triumph over them all i value this
