invincibility of the french and the minister of war does not even care to hear the details thats just it my dear fellow you see its hurrah for the tsar for russia for the orthodox greek faith all that is beautiful but what do we i mean the austrian court care for your victories bring us nice news of a victory by the archduke karl or ferdinand one archdukes as good as another as you know and even if it is only over a fire brigade of bonapartes that will be another story and well fire off some cannon but this sort of thing seems done on purpose to vex us the archduke karl does nothing the archduke ferdinand disgraces himself you abandon vienna give up its defense as much as to say heaven is with us but heaven help you and your capital the one general whom we all loved schmidt you expose to a bullet and then you congratulate us on the victory admit that more irritating news than yours could not have been conceived its as if it had been done on purpose on purpose besides suppose you did gain a brilliant victory if even the archduke karl gained a victory what effect would that have on the general course of events its too late now when vienna is occupied by the french army what occupied vienna occupied not only occupied but bonaparte is at schnbrunn and the count our dear count vrbna goes to him for orders after the fatigues and impressions of the journey his reception and especially after having dined bolknski felt that he could not take in the full significance of the words he heard count lichtenfels was here this morning bilbin continued and showed me a letter in which the parade of the french in vienna was fully described prince murat et tout le tremblement you see that your victory is not a matter for great rejoicing and that you cant be received as a savior really i dont care about that i dont care at all said prince andrew beginning to understand that his news of the battle before krems was really of small importance in view of such events as the fall of austrias capital how is it vienna was taken what of the bridge and its celebrated bridgehead and prince auersperg we heard reports that prince auersperg was defending vienna he said prince auersperg is on this on our side of the river and is defending us doing it very badly i think but still he is defending us but vienna is on the other side no the bridge has not yet been taken and i hope it will not be for it is mined and orders have been given to blow it up otherwise we should long ago have been in the mountains of bohemia and you and your army would have spent a bad quarter of an hour between two fires but still this does not mean that the campaign is over said prince andrew well i think it is the bigwigs here think so too but they darent say so it will be as i said at the beginning of the campaign it wont be your skirmishing at drrenstein or gunpowder at all that will decide the matter but those who devised it said bilbin quoting one of his own mots releasing the wrinkles on his forehead and pausing the only question is what will come of the meeting between the emperor alexander and the king of prussia in berlin if prussia joins the allies austrias hand will be forced and there will be war if not it is merely a question of settling where the preliminaries of the new campo formio are to be drawn up what an extraordinary genius prince andrew suddenly exclaimed clenching his small hand and striking the table with it and what luck the man has buonaparte said bilbin inquiringly puckering up his forehead to indicate that he was about to say something witty buonaparte he repeated accentuating the u i think however now that he lays down laws for austria at schnbrunn il faut lui faire grce de lu i shall certainly adopt an innovation and call him simply bonaparte we must let him off the u but joking apart said prince andrew do you really think the campaign is over this is what i think austria has been made a fool of and she is not used to it she will retaliate and she has been fooled in the first place
