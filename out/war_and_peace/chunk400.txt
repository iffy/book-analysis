a copy of the manifesto and appeal which he would obtain from count rostopchn that sunday the rostvs went to mass at the razumvskis private chapel as usual it was a hot july day even at ten oclock when the rostvs got out of their carriage at the chapel the sultry air the shouts of hawkers the light and gay summer clothes of the crowd the dusty leaves of the trees on the boulevard the sounds of the band and the white trousers of a battalion marching to parade the rattling of wheels on the cobblestones and the brilliant hot sunshine were all full of that summer languor that content and discontent with the present which is most strongly felt on a bright hot day in town all the moscow notabilities all the rostvs acquaintances were at the razumvskis chapel for as if expecting something to happen many wealthy families who usually left town for their country estates had not gone away that summer as natsha at her mothers side passed through the crowd behind a liveried footman who cleared the way for them she heard a young man speaking about her in too loud a whisper thats rostva the one who shes much thinner but all the same shes pretty she heard or thought she heard the names of kurgin and bolknski but she was always imagining that it always seemed to her that everyone who looked at her was thinking only of what had happened to her with a sinking heart wretched as she always was now when she found herself in a crowd natsha in her lilac silk dress trimmed with black lace walked as women can walk with the more repose and stateliness the greater the pain and shame in her soul she knew for certain that she was pretty but this no longer gave her satisfaction as it used to on the contrary it tormented her more than anything else of late and particularly so on this bright hot summer day in town its sunday again another week past she thought recalling that she had been here the sunday before and always the same life that is no life and the same surroundings in which it used to be so easy to live im pretty im young and i know that now i am good i used to be bad but now i know i am good she thought but yet my best years are slipping by and are no good to anyone she stood by her mothers side and exchanged nods with acquaintances near her from habit she scrutinized the ladies dresses condemned the bearing of a lady standing close by who was not crossing herself properly but in a cramped manner and again she thought with vexation that she was herself being judged and was judging others and suddenly at the sound of the service she felt horrified at her own vileness horrified that the former purity of her soul was again lost to her a comely fresh-looking old man was conducting the service with that mild solemnity which has so elevating and soothing an effect on the souls of the worshipers the gates of the sanctuary screen were closed the curtain was slowly drawn and from behind it a soft mysterious voice pronounced some words tears the cause of which she herself did not understand made natshas breast heave and a joyous but oppressive feeling agitated her teach me what i should do how to live my life how i may grow good forever forever she pleaded the deacon came out onto the raised space before the altar screen and holding his thumb extended drew his long hair from under his dalmatic and making the sign of the cross on his breast began in a loud and solemn voice to recite the words of the prayer in peace let us pray unto the lord as one community without distinction of class without enmity united by brotherly love let us pray thought natsha for the peace that is from above and for the salvation of our souls for the world of angels and all the spirits who dwell above us prayed natsha when they prayed for the warriors she thought of her brother and densov when they prayed for all traveling by land and sea she remembered prince andrew prayed for him and asked god to forgive her all the wrongs she had done him when they prayed for those who love us she prayed for the members of her own family her father and
