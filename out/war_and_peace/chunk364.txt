seemed to pierre that this comet fully responded to what was passing in his own softened and uplifted soul now blossoming into a new life book nine chapter i from the close of the year an intensified arming and concentrating of the forces of western europe began and in these forces millions of men reckoning those transporting and feeding the army moved from the west eastwards to the russian frontier toward which since russian forces had been similarly drawn on the twelfth of june the forces of western europe crossed the russian frontier and war began that is an event took place opposed to human reason and to human nature millions of men perpetrated against one another such innumerable crimes frauds treacheries thefts forgeries issues of false money burglaries incendiarisms and murders as in whole centuries are not recorded in the annals of all the law courts of the world but which those who committed them did not at the time regard as being crimes what produced this extraordinary occurrence what were its causes the historians tell us with nave assurance that its causes were the wrongs inflicted on the duke of oldenburg the nonobservance of the continental system the ambition of napoleon the firmness of alexander the mistakes of the diplomatists and so on consequently it would only have been necessary for metternich rumyntsev or talleyrand between a levee and an evening party to have taken proper pains and written a more adroit note or for napoleon to have written to alexander my respected brother i consent to restore the duchy to the duke of oldenburg and there would have been no war we can understand that the matter seemed like that to contemporaries it naturally seemed to napoleon that the war was caused by englands intrigues as in fact he said on the island of st helena it naturally seemed to members of the english parliament that the cause of the war was napoleons ambition to the duke of oldenburg that the cause of the war was the violence done to him to businessmen that the cause of the war was the continental system which was ruining europe to the generals and old soldiers that the chief reason for the war was the necessity of giving them employment to the legitimists of that day that it was the need of re-establishing les bons principes and to the diplomatists of that time that it all resulted from the fact that the alliance between russia and austria in had not been sufficiently well concealed from napoleon and from the awkward wording of memorandum no it is natural that these and a countless and infinite quantity of other reasons the number depending on the endless diversity of points of view presented themselves to the men of that day but to us to posterity who view the thing that happened in all its magnitude and perceive its plain and terrible meaning these causes seem insufficient to us it is incomprehensible that millions of christian men killed and tortured each other either because napoleon was ambitious or alexander was firm or because englands policy was astute or the duke of oldenburg wronged we cannot grasp what connection such circumstances have with the actual fact of slaughter and violence why because the duke was wronged thousands of men from the other side of europe killed and ruined the people of smolnsk and moscow and were killed by them to us their descendants who are not historians and are not carried away by the process of research and can therefore regard the event with unclouded common sense an incalculable number of causes present themselves the deeper we delve in search of these causes the more of them we find and each separate cause or whole series of causes appears to us equally valid in itself and equally false by its insignificance compared to the magnitude of the events and by its impotence apart from the cooperation of all the other coincident causes to occasion the event to us the wish or objection of this or that french corporal to serve a second term appears as much a cause as napoleons refusal to withdraw his troops beyond the vistula and to restore the duchy of oldenburg for had he not wished to serve and had a second a third and a thousandth corporal and private also refused there would have been so many less men in napoleons army and the war could not have occurred had napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdraw beyond
