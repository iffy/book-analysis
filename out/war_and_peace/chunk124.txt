the large drawing room prince vasli came up to pierre with languid footsteps pierre rose and said it was getting late prince vasli gave him a look of stern inquiry as though what pierre had just said was so strange that one could not take it in but then the expression of severity changed and he drew pierres hand downwards made him sit down and smiled affectionately well llya he asked turning instantly to his daughter and addressing her with the careless tone of habitual tenderness natural to parents who have petted their children from babyhood but which prince vasli had only acquired by imitating other parents and he again turned to pierre sergy kuzmch from all sides he said unbuttoning the top button of his waistcoat pierre smiled but his smile showed that he knew it was not the story about sergy kuzmch that interested prince vasli just then and prince vasli saw that pierre knew this he suddenly muttered something and went away it seemed to pierre that even the prince was disconcerted the sight of the discomposure of that old man of the world touched pierre he looked at hlne and she too seemed disconcerted and her look seemed to say well it is your own fault the step must be taken but i cannot i cannot thought pierre and he again began speaking about indifferent matters about sergy kuzmch asking what the point of the story was as he had not heard it properly hlne answered with a smile that she too had missed it when prince vasli returned to the drawing room the princess his wife was talking in low tones to the elderly lady about pierre of course it is a very brilliant match but happiness my dear marriages are made in heaven replied the elderly lady prince vasli passed by seeming not to hear the ladies and sat down on a sofa in a far corner of the room he closed his eyes and seemed to be dozing his head sank forward and then he roused himself aline he said to his wife go and see what they are about the princess went up to the door passed by it with a dignified and indifferent air and glanced into the little drawing room pierre and hlne still sat talking just as before still the same she said to her husband prince vasli frowned twisting his mouth his cheeks quivered and his face assumed the coarse unpleasant expression peculiar to him shaking himself he rose threw back his head and with resolute steps went past the ladies into the little drawing room with quick steps he went joyfully up to pierre his face was so unusually triumphant that pierre rose in alarm on seeing it thank god said prince vasli my wife has told me everything he put one arm around pierre and the other around his daughter my dear boy llya i am very pleased his voice trembled i loved your father and she will make you a good wife god bless you he embraced his daughter and then again pierre and kissed him with his malodorous mouth tears actually moistened his cheeks princess come here he shouted the old princess came in and also wept the elderly lady was using her handkerchief too pierre was kissed and he kissed the beautiful hlnes hand several times after a while they were left alone again all this had to be and could not be otherwise thought pierre so it is useless to ask whether it is good or bad it is good because its definite and one is rid of the old tormenting doubt pierre held the hand of his betrothed in silence looking at her beautiful bosom as it rose and fell hlne he said aloud and paused something special is always said in such cases he thought but could not remember what it was that people say he looked at her face she drew nearer to him her face flushed oh take those off those she said pointing to his spectacles pierre took them off and his eyes besides the strange look eyes have from which spectacles have just been removed had also a frightened and inquiring look he was about to stoop over her hand and kiss it but with a rapid almost brutal movement of her head she intercepted his lips and met them with her own her face struck pierre by its altered unpleasantly excited expression it is too late now its done besides i love her thought pierre je vous
