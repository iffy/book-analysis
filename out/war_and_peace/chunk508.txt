lay member of the society of jesus one day he took the countess to a roman catholic church where she knelt down before the altar to which she was led the enchanting middle-aged frenchman laid his hands on her head and as she herself afterward described it she felt something like a fresh breeze wafted into her soul it was explained to her that this was la grce after that a long-frocked abb was brought to her she confessed to him and he absolved her from her sins next day she received a box containing the sacred host which was left at her house for her to partake of a few days later hlne learned with pleasure that she had now been admitted to the true catholic church and that in a few days the pope himself would hear of her and would send her a certain document all that was done around her and to her at this time all the attention devoted to her by so many clever men and expressed in such pleasant refined ways and the state of dove-like purity she was now in she wore only white dresses and white ribbons all that time gave her pleasure but her pleasure did not cause her for a moment to forget her aim and as it always happens in contests of cunning that a stupid person gets the better of cleverer ones hlne having realized that the main object of all these words and all this trouble was after converting her to catholicism to obtain money from her for jesuit institutions as to which she received indications before parting with her money insisted that the various operations necessary to free her from her husband should be performed in her view the aim of every religion was merely to preserve certain proprieties while affording satisfaction to human desires and with this aim in one of her talks with her father confessor she insisted on an answer to the question in how far was she bound by her marriage they were sitting in the twilight by a window in the drawing room the scent of flowers came in at the window hlne was wearing a white dress transparent over her shoulders and bosom the abb a well-fed man with a plump clean-shaven chin a pleasant firm mouth and white hands meekly folded on his knees sat close to hlne and with a subtle smile on his lips and a peaceful look of delight at her beauty occasionally glanced at her face as he explained his opinion on the subject hlne with an uneasy smile looked at his curly hair and his plump clean-shaven blackish cheeks and every moment expected the conversation to take a fresh turn but the abb though he evidently enjoyed the beauty of his companion was absorbed in his mastery of the matter the course of the father confessors arguments ran as follows ignorant of the import of what you were undertaking you made a vow of conjugal fidelity to a man who on his part by entering the married state without faith in the religious significance of marriage committed an act of sacrilege that marriage lacked the dual significance it should have had yet in spite of this your vow was binding you swerved from it what did you commit by so acting a venial or a mortal sin a venial sin for you acted without evil intention if now you married again with the object of bearing children your sin might be forgiven but the question is again a twofold one firstly but suddenly hlne who was getting bored said with one of her bewitching smiles but i think that having espoused the true religion i cannot be bound by what a false religion laid upon me the director of her conscience was astounded at having the case presented to him thus with the simplicity of columbus egg he was delighted at the unexpected rapidity of his pupils progress but could not abandon the edifice of argument he had laboriously constructed let us understand one another countess said he with a smile and began refuting his spiritual daughters arguments chapter vii hlne understood that the question was very simple and easy from the ecclesiastical point of view and that her directors were making difficulties only because they were apprehensive as to how the matter would be regarded by the secular authorities so she decided that it was necessary to prepare the opinion of society she provoked the jealousy of the elderly magnate and told him what
