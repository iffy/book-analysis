bounteous mercy and loving-kindness which are from of old turn not thy face from us but be gracious to our unworthiness and in thy great goodness and thy many mercies regard not our transgressions and iniquities create in us a clean heart and renew a right spirit within us strengthen us all in thy faith fortify our hope inspire us with true love one for another arm us with unity of spirit in the righteous defense of the heritage thou gavest to us and to our fathers and let not the scepter of the wicked be exalted against the destiny of those thou hast sanctified o lord our god in whom we believe and in whom we put our trust let us not be confounded in our hope of thy mercy and give us a token of thy blessing that those who hate us and our orthodox faith may see it and be put to shame and perish and may all the nations know that thou art the lord and we are thy people show thy mercy upon us this day o lord and grant us thy salvation make the hearts of thy servants to rejoice in thy mercy smite down our enemies and destroy them swiftly beneath the feet of thy faithful servants for thou art the defense the succor and the victory of them that put their trust in thee and to thee be all glory to father son and holy ghost now and forever world without end amen in natshas receptive condition of soul this prayer affected her strongly she listened to every word about the victory of moses over amalek of gideon over midian and of david over goliath and about the destruction of thy jerusalem and she prayed to god with the tenderness and emotion with which her heart was overflowing but without fully understanding what she was asking of god in that prayer she shared with all her heart in the prayer for the spirit of righteousness for the strengthening of the heart by faith and hope and its animation by love but she could not pray that her enemies might be trampled under foot when but a few minutes before she had been wishing she had more of them that she might pray for them but neither could she doubt the righteousness of the prayer that was being read on bended knees she felt in her heart a devout and tremulous awe at the thought of the punishment that overtakes men for their sins and especially of her own sins and she prayed to god to forgive them all and her too and to give them all and her too peace and happiness and it seemed to her that god heard her prayer chapter xix from the day when pierre after leaving the rostvs with natshas grateful look fresh in his mind had gazed at the comet that seemed to be fixed in the sky and felt that something new was appearing on his own horizon from that day the problem of the vanity and uselessness of all earthly things that had incessantly tormented him no longer presented itself that terrible question why wherefore which had come to him amid every occupation was now replaced not by another question or by a reply to the former question but by her image when he listened to or himself took part in trivial conversations when he read or heard of human baseness or folly he was not horrified as formerly and did not ask himself why men struggled so about these things when all is so transient and incomprehensible but he remembered her as he had last seen her and all his doubts vanished not because she had answered the questions that had haunted him but because his conception of her transferred him instantly to another a brighter realm of spiritual activity in which no one could be justified or guilty a realm of beauty and love which it was worth living for whatever worldly baseness presented itself to him he said to himself well supposing n n has swindled the country and the tsar and the country and the tsar confer honors upon him what does that matter she smiled at me yesterday and asked me to come again and i love her and no one will ever know it and his soul felt calm and peaceful pierre still went into society drank as much and led the same idle and dissipated life because besides the hours he spent at the rostvs there were other hours
