the two scraggy oaks rising above the aspen undergrowth and the gully with its water-worn side and uncles cap just visible above the bush on his right no i shant have such luck thought rostv yet what wouldnt it be worth it is not to be everywhere at cards and in war i am always unlucky memories of austerlitz and of dlokhov flashed rapidly and clearly through his mind only once in my life to get an old wolf i want only that thought he straining eyes and ears and looking to the left and then to the right and listening to the slightest variation of note in the cries of the dogs again he looked to the right and saw something running toward him across the deserted field no it cant be thought rostv taking a deep breath as a man does at the coming of something long hoped for the height of happiness was reached and so simply without warning or noise or display that rostv could not believe his eyes and remained in doubt for over a second the wolf ran forward and jumped heavily over a gully that lay in her path she was an old animal with a gray back and big reddish belly she ran without hurry evidently feeling sure that no one saw her rostv holding his breath looked round at the borzois they stood or lay not seeing the wolf or understanding the situation old kary had turned his head and was angrily searching for fleas baring his yellow teeth and snapping at his hind legs ulyulyulyu whispered rostv pouting his lips the borzois jumped up jerking the rings of the leashes and pricking their ears kary finished scratching his hindquarters and cocking his ears got up with quivering tail from which tufts of matted hair hung down shall i loose them or not nicholas asked himself as the wolf approached him coming from the copse suddenly the wolfs whole physiognomy changed she shuddered seeing what she had probably never seen before human eyes fixed upon her and turning her head a little toward rostv she paused back or forward eh no matter forward the wolf seemed to say to herself and she moved forward without again looking round and with a quiet long easy yet resolute lope ulyulyu cried nicholas in a voice not his own and of its own accord his good horse darted headlong downhill leaping over gullies to head off the wolf and the borzois passed it running faster still nicholas did not hear his own cry nor feel that he was galloping nor see the borzois nor the ground over which he went he saw only the wolf who increasing her speed bounded on in the same direction along the hollow the first to come into view was mlka with her black markings and powerful quarters gaining upon the wolf nearer and nearer now she was ahead of it but the wolf turned its head to face her and instead of putting on speed as she usually did mlka suddenly raised her tail and stiffened her forelegs ulyulyulyulyu shouted nicholas the reddish lyubm rushed forward from behind mlka sprang impetuously at the wolf and seized it by its hindquarters but immediately jumped aside in terror the wolf crouched gnashed her teeth and again rose and bounded forward followed at the distance of a couple of feet by all the borzois who did not get any closer to her shell get away no its impossible thought nicholas still shouting with a hoarse voice kary ulyulyu he shouted looking round for the old borzoi who was now his only hope kary with all the strength age had left him stretched himself to the utmost and watching the wolf galloped heavily aside to intercept it but the quickness of the wolfs lope and the borzois slower pace made it plain that kary had miscalculated nicholas could already see not far in front of him the wood where the wolf would certainly escape should she reach it but coming toward him he saw hounds and a huntsman galloping almost straight at the wolf there was still hope a long yellowish young borzoi one nicholas did not know from another leash rushed impetuously at the wolf from in front and almost knocked her over but the wolf jumped up more quickly than anyone could have expected and gnashing her teeth flew at the yellowish borzoi which with a piercing yelp fell with its head on the ground bleeding from a gash in its side
