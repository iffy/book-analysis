be to unload the muskets explode the ammunition and all return home as quickly as possible but the guns remained loaded the loopholes in blockhouses and entrenchments looked out just as menacingly and the unlimbered cannon confronted one another as before chapter xvi having ridden round the whole line from right flank to left prince andrew made his way up to the battery from which the staff officer had told him the whole field could be seen here he dismounted and stopped beside the farthest of the four unlimbered cannon before the guns an artillery sentry was pacing up and down he stood at attention when the officer arrived but at a sign resumed his measured monotonous pacing behind the guns were their limbers and still farther back picket ropes and artillerymens bonfires to the left not far from the farthest cannon was a small newly constructed wattle shed from which came the sound of officers voices in eager conversation it was true that a view over nearly the whole russian position and the greater part of the enemys opened out from this battery just facing it on the crest of the opposite hill the village of schn grabern could be seen and in three places to left and right the french troops amid the smoke of their campfires the greater part of whom were evidently in the village itself and behind the hill to the left from that village amid the smoke was something resembling a battery but it was impossible to see it clearly with the naked eye our right flank was posted on a rather steep incline which dominated the french position our infantry were stationed there and at the farthest point the dragoons in the center where tshins battery stood and from which prince andrew was surveying the position was the easiest and most direct descent and ascent to the brook separating us from schn grabern on the left our troops were close to a copse in which smoked the bonfires of our infantry who were felling wood the french line was wider than ours and it was plain that they could easily outflank us on both sides behind our position was a steep and deep dip making it difficult for artillery and cavalry to retire prince andrew took out his notebook and leaning on the cannon sketched a plan of the position he made some notes on two points intending to mention them to bagratin his idea was first to concentrate all the artillery in the center and secondly to withdraw the cavalry to the other side of the dip prince andrew being always near the commander in chief closely following the mass movements and general orders and constantly studying historical accounts of battles involuntarily pictured to himself the course of events in the forthcoming action in broad outline he imagined only important possibilities if the enemy attacks the right flank he said to himself the kiev grenadiers and the podlsk chasseurs must hold their position till reserves from the center come up in that case the dragoons could successfully make a flank counterattack if they attack our center we having the center battery on this high ground shall withdraw the left flank under its cover and retreat to the dip by echelons so he reasoned all the time he had been beside the gun he had heard the voices of the officers distinctly but as often happens had not understood a word of what they were saying suddenly however he was struck by a voice coming from the shed and its tone was so sincere that he could not but listen no friend said a pleasant and as it seemed to prince andrew a familiar voice what i say is that if it were possible to know what is beyond death none of us would be afraid of it thats so friend another a younger voice interrupted him afraid or not you cant escape it anyhow all the same one is afraid oh you clever people said a third manly voice interrupting them both of course you artillery men are very wise because you can take everything along with you vodka and snacks and the owner of the manly voice evidently an infantry officer laughed yes one is afraid continued the first speaker he of the familiar voice one is afraid of the unknown thats what it is whatever we may say about the soul going to the sky we know there is no sky but only an atmosphere the manly voice again interrupted the artillery
