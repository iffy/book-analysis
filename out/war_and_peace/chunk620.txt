those forests and fields the bright oscillating limitless distance lured one to itself pierre glanced up at the sky and the twinkling stars in its faraway depths and all that is me all that is within me and it is all i thought pierre and they caught all that and put it into a shed boarded up with planks he smiled and went and lay down to sleep beside his companions chapter xv in the early days of october another envoy came to kutzov with a letter from napoleon proposing peace and falsely dated from moscow though napoleon was already not far from kutzov on the old kalga road kutzov replied to this letter as he had done to the one formerly brought by lauriston saying that there could be no question of peace soon after that a report was received from drokhovs guerrilla detachment operating to the left of tartino that troops of broussiers division had been seen at formnsk and that being separated from the rest of the french army they might easily be destroyed the soldiers and officers again demanded action generals on the staff excited by the memory of the easy victory at tartino urged kutzov to carry out drokhovs suggestion kutzov did not consider any offensive necessary the result was a compromise which was inevitable a small detachment was sent to formnsk to attack broussier by a strange coincidence this task which turned out to be a most difficult and important one was entrusted to dokhtrov that same modest little dokhtrov whom no one had described to us as drawing up plans of battles dashing about in front of regiments showering crosses on batteries and so on and who was thought to be and was spoken of as undecided and undiscerning but whom we find commanding wherever the position was most difficult all through the russo-french wars from austerlitz to the year at austerlitz he remained last at the augezd dam rallying the regiments saving what was possible when all were flying and perishing and not a single general was left in the rear guard ill with fever he went to smolnsk with twenty thousand men to defend the town against napoleons whole army in smolnsk at the malkhov gate he had hardly dozed off in a paroxysm of fever before he was awakened by the bombardment of the town and smolnsk held out all day long at the battle of borodin when bagratin was killed and nine tenths of the men of our left flank had fallen and the full force of the french artillery fire was directed against it the man sent there was this same irresolute and undiscerning dokhtrov kutzov hastening to rectify a mistake he had made by sending someone else there first and the quiet little dokhtrov rode thither and borodin became the greatest glory of the russian army many heroes have been described to us in verse and prose but of dokhtrov scarcely a word has been said it was dokhtrov again whom they sent to formnsk and from there to mlo-yaroslvets the place where the last battle with the french was fought and where the obvious disintegration of the french army began and we are told of many geniuses and heroes of that period of the campaign but of dokhtrov nothing or very little is said and that dubiously and this silence about dokhtrov is the clearest testimony to his merit it is natural for a man who does not understand the workings of a machine to imagine that a shaving that has fallen into it by chance and is interfering with its action and tossing about in it is its most important part the man who does not understand the construction of the machine cannot conceive that the small connecting cogwheel which revolves quietly is one of the most essential parts of the machine and not the shaving which merely harms and hinders the working on the tenth of october when dokhtrov had gone halfway to formnsk and stopped at the village of aristvo preparing faithfully to execute the orders he had received the whole french army having in its convulsive movement reached murats position apparently in order to give battle suddenly without any reason turned off to the left onto the new kalga road and began to enter formnsk where only broussier had been till then at that time dokhtrov had under his command besides drokhovs detachment the two small guerrilla detachments of figner and seslvin on the evening of october seslvin came to the aristvo headquarters with
