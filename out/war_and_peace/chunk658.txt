as he had done at tartino and vyzma to hastening it on while easing the movement of our army but besides this since the exhaustion and enormous diminution of the army caused by the rapidity of the advance had become evident another reason for slackening the pace and delaying presented itself to kutzov the aim of the russian army was to pursue the french the road the french would take was unknown and so the closer our troops trod on their heels the greater distance they had to cover only by following at some distance could one cut across the zigzag path of the french all the artful maneuvers suggested by our generals meant fresh movements of the army and a lengthening of its marches whereas the only reasonable aim was to shorten those marches to that end kutzovs activity was directed during the whole campaign from moscow to vlna not casually or intermittently but so consistently that he never once deviated from it kutzov felt and knew not by reasoning or science but with the whole of his russian being what every russian soldier felt that the french were beaten that the enemy was flying and must be driven out but at the same time he like the soldiers realized all the hardship of this march the rapidity of which was unparalleled for such a time of the year but to the generals especially the foreign ones in the russian army who wished to distinguish themselves to astonish somebody and for some reason to capture a king or a duke it seemed that now when any battle must be horrible and senseless was the very time to fight and conquer somebody kutzov merely shrugged his shoulders when one after another they presented projects of maneuvers to be made with those soldiers ill-shod insufficiently clad and half starved who within a month and without fighting a battle had dwindled to half their number and who at the best if the flight continued would have to go a greater distance than they had already traversed before they reached the frontier this longing to distinguish themselves to maneuver to overthrow and to cut off showed itself particularly whenever the russians stumbled on the french army so it was at krsnoe where they expected to find one of the three french columns and stumbled instead on napoleon himself with sixteen thousand men despite all kutzovs efforts to avoid that ruinous encounter and to preserve his troops the massacre of the broken mob of french soldiers by worn-out russians continued at krsnoe for three days toll wrote a disposition the first column will march to so and so etc and as usual nothing happened in accord with the disposition prince eugne of wrttemberg fired from a hill over the french crowds that were running past and demanded reinforcements which did not arrive the french avoiding the russians dispersed and hid themselves in the forest by night making their way round as best they could and continued their flight milordovich who said he did not want to know anything about the commissariat affairs of his detachment and could never be found when he was wanted that chevalier sans peur et sans reproche as he styled himself who was fond of parleys with the french sent envoys demanding their surrender wasted time and did not do what he was ordered to do knight without fear and without reproach i give you that column lads he said riding up to the troops and pointing out the french to the cavalry and the cavalry with spurs and sabers urging on horses that could scarcely move trotted with much effort to the column presented to them that is to say to a crowd of frenchmen stark with cold frost-bitten and starving and the column that had been presented to them threw down its arms and surrendered as it had long been anxious to do at krsnoe they took twenty-six thousand prisoners several hundred cannon and a stick called a marshals staff and disputed as to who had distinguished himself and were pleased with their achievement though they much regretted not having taken napoleon or at least a marshal or a hero of some sort and reproached one another and especially kutzov for having failed to do so these men carried away by their passions were but blind tools of the most melancholy law of necessity but considered themselves heroes and imagined that they were accomplishing a most noble and honorable deed they blamed kutzov and said that from the very beginning
