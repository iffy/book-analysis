to be in a state of war with me from the time prince kurkin asked for his passports the reasons on which the duc de bassano based his refusal to deliver them to him would never have led me to suppose that that could serve as a pretext for aggression in fact the ambassador as he himself has declared was never authorized to make that demand and as soon as i was informed of it i let him know how much i disapproved of it and ordered him to remain at his post if your majesty does not intend to shed the blood of our peoples for such a misunderstanding and consents to withdraw your troops from russian territory i will regard what has passed as not having occurred and an understanding between us will be possible in the contrary case your majesty i shall see myself forced to repel an attack that nothing on my part has provoked it still depends on your majesty to preserve humanity from the calamity of another war i am etc signed alexander chapter iv at two in the morning of the fourteenth of june the emperor having sent for balashv and read him his letter to napoleon ordered him to take it and hand it personally to the french emperor when dispatching balashv the emperor repeated to him the words that he would not make peace so long as a single armed enemy remained on russian soil and told him to transmit those words to napoleon alexander did not insert them in his letter to napoleon because with his characteristic tact he felt it would be injudicious to use them at a moment when a last attempt at reconciliation was being made but he definitely instructed balashv to repeat them personally to napoleon having set off in the small hours of the fourteenth accompanied by a bugler and two cossacks balashv reached the french outposts at the village of ryknty on the russian side of the niemen by dawn there he was stopped by french cavalry sentinels a french noncommissioned officer of hussars in crimson uniform and a shaggy cap shouted to the approaching balashv to halt balashv did not do so at once but continued to advance along the road at a walking pace the noncommissioned officer frowned and muttering words of abuse advanced his horses chest against balashv put his hand to his saber and shouted rudely at the russian general asking was he deaf that he did not do as he was told balashv mentioned who he was the noncommissioned officer began talking with his comrades about regimental matters without looking at the russian general after living at the seat of the highest authority and power after conversing with the emperor less than three hours before and in general being accustomed to the respect due to his rank in the service balashv found it very strange here on russian soil to encounter this hostile and still more this disrespectful application of brute force to himself the sun was only just appearing from behind the clouds the air was fresh and dewy a herd of cattle was being driven along the road from the village and over the fields the larks rose trilling one after another like bubbles rising in water balashv looked around him awaiting the arrival of an officer from the village the russian cossacks and bugler and the french hussars looked silently at one another from time to time a french colonel of hussars who had evidently just left his bed came riding from the village on a handsome sleek gray horse accompanied by two hussars the officer the soldiers and their horses all looked smart and well kept it was that first period of a campaign when troops are still in full trim almost like that of peacetime maneuvers but with a shade of martial swagger in their clothes and a touch of the gaiety and spirit of enterprise which always accompany the opening of a campaign the french colonel with difficulty repressed a yawn but was polite and evidently understood balashvs importance he led him past his soldiers and behind the outposts and told him that his wish to be presented to the emperor would most likely be satisfied immediately as the emperors quarters were he believed not far off they rode through the village of ryknty past tethered french hussar horses past sentinels and men who saluted their colonel and stared with curiosity at a russian uniform and came out at the other end of the village
