this period of the campaign the historians who attributed the actions of the mass to the will of one man would have found it impossible to make the story of the retreat fit their theory but no mountains of books have been written by the historians about this campaign and everywhere are described napoleons arrangements the maneuvers and his profound plans which guided the army as well as the military genius shown by his marshals the retreat from mlo-yaroslvets when he had a free road into a well-supplied district and the parallel road was open to him along which kutzov afterwards pursued him this unnecessary retreat along a devastated road is explained to us as being due to profound considerations similarly profound considerations are given for his retreat from smolnsk to orsh then his heroism at krsnoe is described where he is reported to have been prepared to accept battle and take personal command and to have walked about with a birch stick and said jai assez fait lempereur il est temps de faire le gnral but nevertheless immediately ran away again abandoning to its fate the scattered fragments of the army he left behind i have acted the emperor long enough it is time to act the general then we are told of the greatness of soul of the marshals especially of ney a greatness of soul consisting in this that he made his way by night around through the forest and across the dnieper and escaped to orsh abandoning standards artillery and nine tenths of his men and lastly the final departure of the great emperor from his heroic army is presented to us by the historians as something great and characteristic of genius even that final running away described in ordinary language as the lowest depth of baseness which every child is taught to be ashamed of even that act finds justification in the historians language when it is impossible to stretch the very elastic threads of historical ratiocination any farther when actions are clearly contrary to all that humanity calls right or even just the historians produce a saving conception of greatness greatness it seems excludes the standards of right and wrong for the great man nothing is wrong there is no atrocity for which a great man can be blamed cest grand say the historians and there no longer exists either good or evil but only grand and not grand grand is good not grand is bad grand is the characteristic in their conception of some special animals called heroes and napoleon escaping home in a warm fur coat and leaving to perish those who were not merely his comrades but were in his opinion men he had brought there feels que cest grand and his soul is tranquil it is great that it is great du sublime he saw something sublime in himself au ridicule il ny a quun pas said he and the whole world for fifty years has been repeating sublime grand napolon le grand du sublime au ridicule il ny a quun pas from the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step and it occurs to no one that to admit a greatness not commensurable with the standard of right and wrong is merely to admit ones own nothingness and immeasurable meanness for us with the standard of good and evil given us by christ no human actions are incommensurable and there is no greatness where simplicity goodness and truth are absent chapter xix what russian reading the account of the last part of the campaign of has not experienced an uncomfortable feeling of regret dissatisfaction and perplexity who has not asked himself how it is that the french were not all captured or destroyed when our three armies surrounded them in superior numbers when the disordered french hungry and freezing surrendered in crowds and when as the historians relate the aim of the russians was to stop the french to cut them off and capture them all how was it that the russian army which when numerically weaker than the french had given battle at borodin did not achieve its purpose when it had surrounded the french on three sides and when its aim was to capture them can the french be so enormously superior to us that when we had surrounded them with superior forces we could not beat them how could that happen history or what is called by that name replying to these questions says that this occurred because kutzov and tormsov and chichagv and this man and
