later the marshals adjutant de castrs came in and conducted balashv to the quarters assigned him that day he dined with the marshal at the same board on the barrels next day davout rode out early and after asking balashv to come to him peremptorily requested him to remain there to move on with the baggage train should orders come for it to move and to talk to no one except monsieur de castrs after four days of solitude ennui and consciousness of his impotence and insignificance particularly acute by contrast with the sphere of power in which he had so lately moved and after several marches with the marshals baggage and the french army which occupied the whole district balashv was brought to vlna now occupied by the french through the very gate by which he had left it four days previously next day the imperial gentleman-in-waiting the comte de turenne came to balashv and informed him of the emperor napoleons wish to honor him with an audience four days before sentinels of the preobrazhnsk regiment had stood in front of the house to which balashv was conducted and now two french grenadiers stood there in blue uniforms unfastened in front and with shaggy caps on their heads and an escort of hussars and uhlans and a brilliant suite of aides-de-camp pages and generals who were waiting for napoleon to come out were standing at the porch round his saddle horse and his mameluke rustan napoleon received balashv in the very house in vlna from which alexander had dispatched him on his mission chapter vi though balashv was used to imperial pomp he was amazed at the luxury and magnificence of napoleons court the comte de turenne showed him into a big reception room where many generals gentlemen-in-waiting and polish magnates several of whom balashv had seen at the court of the emperor of russia were waiting duroc said that napoleon would receive the russian general before going for his ride after some minutes the gentleman-in-waiting who was on duty came into the great reception room and bowing politely asked balashv to follow him balashv went into a small reception room one door of which led into a study the very one from which the russian emperor had dispatched him on his mission he stood a minute or two waiting he heard hurried footsteps beyond the door both halves of it were opened rapidly all was silent and then from the study the sound was heard of other steps firm and resolute they were those of napoleon he had just finished dressing for his ride and wore a blue uniform opening in front over a white waistcoat so long that it covered his rotund stomach white leather breeches tightly fitting the fat thighs of his short legs and hessian boots his short hair had evidently just been brushed but one lock hung down in the middle of his broad forehead his plump white neck stood out sharply above the black collar of his uniform and he smelled of eau de cologne his full face rather young-looking with its prominent chin wore a gracious and majestic expression of imperial welcome he entered briskly with a jerk at every step and his head slightly thrown back his whole short corpulent figure with broad thick shoulders and chest and stomach involuntarily protruding had that imposing and stately appearance one sees in men of forty who live in comfort it was evident too that he was in the best of spirits that day he nodded in answer to balashvs low and respectful bow and coming up to him at once began speaking like a man who values every moment of his time and does not condescend to prepare what he has to say but is sure he will always say the right thing and say it well good day general said he i have received the letter you brought from the emperor alexander and am very glad to see you he glanced with his large eyes into balashvs face and immediately looked past him it was plain that balashvs personality did not interest him at all evidently only what took place within his own mind interested him nothing outside himself had any significance for him because everything in the world it seemed to him depended entirely on his will i do not and did not desire war he continued but it has been forced on me even now he emphasized the word i am ready to receive any explanations you can give me and he
