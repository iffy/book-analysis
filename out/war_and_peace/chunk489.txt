it had been at lodi marengo arcola jena austerlitz wagram and so on but now something strange was happening to his troops despite news of the capture of the flches napoleon saw that this was not the same not at all the same as what had happened in his former battles he saw that what he was feeling was felt by all the men about him experienced in the art of war all their faces looked dejected and they all shunned one anothers eyes only a de beausset could fail to grasp the meaning of what was happening but napoleon with his long experience of war well knew the meaning of a battle not gained by the attacking side in eight hours after all efforts had been expended he knew that it was a lost battle and that the least accident might now with the fight balanced on such a strained center destroy him and his army when he ran his mind over the whole of this strange russian campaign in which not one battle had been won and in which not a flag or cannon or army corps had been captured in two months when he looked at the concealed depression on the faces around him and heard reports of the russians still holding their ground a terrible feeling like a nightmare took possession of him and all the unlucky accidents that might destroy him occurred to his mind the russians might fall on his left wing might break through his center he himself might be killed by a stray cannon ball all this was possible in former battles he had only considered the possibilities of success but now innumerable unlucky chances presented themselves and he expected them all yes it was like a dream in which a man fancies that a ruffian is coming to attack him and raises his arm to strike that ruffian a terrible blow which he knows should annihilate him but then feels that his arm drops powerless and limp like a rag and the horror of unavoidable destruction seizes him in his helplessness the news that the russians were attacking the left flank of the french army aroused that horror in napoleon he sat silently on a campstool below the knoll with head bowed and elbows on his knees berthier approached and suggested that they should ride along the line to ascertain the position of affairs what what do you say asked napoleon yes tell them to bring me my horse he mounted and rode toward semnovsk amid the powder smoke slowly dispersing over the whole space through which napoleon rode horses and men were lying in pools of blood singly or in heaps neither napoleon nor any of his generals had ever before seen such horrors or so many slain in such a small area the roar of guns that had not ceased for ten hours wearied the ear and gave a peculiar significance to the spectacle as music does to tableaux vivants napoleon rode up the high ground at semnovsk and through the smoke saw ranks of men in uniforms of a color unfamiliar to him they were russians the russians stood in serried ranks behind semnovsk village and its knoll and their guns boomed incessantly along their line and sent forth clouds of smoke it was no longer a battle it was a continuous slaughter which could be of no avail either to the french or the russians napoleon stopped his horse and again fell into the reverie from which berthier had aroused him he could not stop what was going on before him and around him and was supposed to be directed by him and to depend on him and from its lack of success this affair for the first time seemed to him unnecessary and horrible one of the generals rode up to napoleon and ventured to offer to lead the old guard into action ney and berthier standing near napoleon exchanged looks and smiled contemptuously at this generals senseless offer napoleon bowed his head and remained silent a long time at eight hundred leagues from france i will not have my guard destroyed he said and turning his horse rode back to shevrdino chapter xxxv on the rug-covered bench where pierre had seen him in the morning sat kutzov his gray head hanging his heavy body relaxed he gave no orders but only assented to or dissented from what others suggested yes yes do that he replied to various proposals yes yes go dear boy and have a look
