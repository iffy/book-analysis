his conscience with an evil deed but now he saw in him a human being he reflected for a moment how can you show me that you are telling the truth said davout coldly pierre remembered ramballe and named him and his regiment and the street where the house was you are not what you say returned davout in a trembling faltering voice pierre began adducing proofs of the truth of his statements but at that moment an adjutant entered and reported something to davout davout brightened up at the news the adjutant brought and began buttoning up his uniform it seemed that he had quite forgotten pierre when the adjutant reminded him of the prisoner he jerked his head in pierres direction with a frown and ordered him to be led away but where they were to take him pierre did not know back to the coach house or to the place of execution his companions had pointed out to him as they crossed the virgins field he turned his head and saw that the adjutant was putting another question to davout yes of course replied davout but what this yes meant pierre did not know pierre could not afterwards remember how he went whether it was far or in which direction his faculties were quite numbed he was stupefied and noticing nothing around him went on moving his legs as the others did till they all stopped and he stopped too the only thought in his mind at that time was who was it that had really sentenced him to death not the men on the commission that had first examined him not one of them wished to or evidently could have done it it was not davout who had looked at him in so human a way in another moment davout would have realized that he was doing wrong but just then the adjutant had come in and interrupted him the adjutant also had evidently had no evil intent though he might have refrained from coming in then who was executing him killing him depriving him of life him pierre with all his memories aspirations hopes and thoughts who was doing this and pierre felt that it was no one it was a system a concurrence of circumstances a system of some sort was killing him pierre depriving him of life of everything annihilating him chapter xi from prince shcherbtovs house the prisoners were led straight down the virgins field to the left of the nunnery as far as a kitchen garden in which a post had been set up beyond that post a fresh pit had been dug in the ground and near the post and the pit a large crowd stood in a semicircle the crowd consisted of a few russians and many of napoleons soldiers who were not on duty germans italians and frenchmen in a variety of uniforms to the right and left of the post stood rows of french troops in blue uniforms with red epaulets and high boots and shakos the prisoners were placed in a certain order according to the list pierre was sixth and were led to the post several drums suddenly began to beat on both sides of them and at that sound pierre felt as if part of his soul had been torn away he lost the power of thinking or understanding he could only hear and see and he had only one wish that the frightful thing that had to happen should happen quickly pierre looked round at his fellow prisoners and scrutinized them the two first were convicts with shaven heads one was tall and thin the other dark shaggy and sinewy with a flat nose the third was a domestic serf about forty-five years old with grizzled hair and a plump well-nourished body the fourth was a peasant a very handsome man with a broad light-brown beard and black eyes the fifth was a factory hand a thin sallow-faced lad of eighteen in a loose coat pierre heard the french consulting whether to shoot them separately or two at a time in couples replied the officer in command in a calm voice there was a stir in the ranks of the soldiers and it was evident that they were all hurrying not as men hurry to do something they understand but as people hurry to finish a necessary but unpleasant and incomprehensible task a french official wearing a scarf came up to the right of the row of prisoners and read out the sentence in russian
