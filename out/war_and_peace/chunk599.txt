did they weep nor did they ever talk to one another about him they felt that they could not express in words what they understood they both saw that he was sinking slowly and quietly deeper and deeper away from them and they both knew that this had to be so and that it was right he confessed and received communion everyone came to take leave of him when they brought his son to him he pressed his lips to the boys and turned away not because he felt it hard and sad princess mary and natsha understood that but simply because he thought it was all that was required of him but when they told him to bless the boy he did what was demanded and looked round as if asking whether there was anything else he should do when the last convulsions of the body which the spirit was leaving occurred princess mary and natsha were present is it over said princess mary when his body had for a few minutes lain motionless growing cold before them natsha went up looked at the dead eyes and hastened to close them she closed them but did not kiss them but clung to that which reminded her most nearly of him his body where has he gone where is he now when the body washed and dressed lay in the coffin on a table everyone came to take leave of him and they all wept little nicholas cried because his heart was rent by painful perplexity the countess and snya cried from pity for natsha and because he was no more the old count cried because he felt that before long he too must take the same terrible step natsha and princess mary also wept now but not because of their own personal grief they wept with a reverent and softening emotion which had taken possession of their souls at the consciousness of the simple and solemn mystery of death that had been accomplished in their presence book thirteen chapter i mans mind cannot grasp the causes of events in their completeness but the desire to find those causes is implanted in mans soul and without considering the multiplicity and complexity of the conditions any one of which taken separately may seem to be the cause he snatches at the first approximation to a cause that seems to him intelligible and says this is the cause in historical events where the actions of men are the subject of observation the first and most primitive approximation to present itself was the will of the gods and after that the will of those who stood in the most prominent position the heroes of history but we need only penetrate to the essence of any historic event which lies in the activity of the general mass of men who take part in it to be convinced that the will of the historic hero does not control the actions of the mass but is itself continually controlled it may seem to be a matter of indifference whether we understand the meaning of historical events this way or that yet there is the same difference between a man who says that the people of the west moved on the east because napoleon wished it and a man who says that this happened because it had to happen as there is between those who declared that the earth was stationary and that the planets moved round it and those who admitted that they did not know what upheld the earth but knew there were laws directing its movement and that of the other planets there is and can be no cause of an historical event except the one cause of all causes but there are laws directing events and some of these laws are known to us while we are conscious of others we cannot comprehend the discovery of these laws is only possible when we have quite abandoned the attempt to find the cause in the will of some one man just as the discovery of the laws of the motion of the planets was possible only when men abandoned the conception of the fixity of the earth the historians consider that next to the battle of borodin and the occupation of moscow by the enemy and its destruction by fire the most important episode of the war of was the movement of the russian army from the ryazna to the kalga road and to the tartino camp the so-called flank march across the krsnaya pakhr river
