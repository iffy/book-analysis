readiness for strife and suffering to all of them from the marshal to the least soldier that place was not the vozdvzhenka mokhavya or kutfyev street nor the tritsa gate places familiar in moscow but a new battlefield which would probably prove sanguinary and all made ready for that battle the cries from the gates ceased the guns were advanced the artillerymen blew the ash off their linstocks and an officer gave the word fire this was followed by two whistling sounds of canister shot one after another the shot rattled against the stone of the gate and upon the wooden beams and screens and two wavering clouds of smoke rose over the square a few instants after the echo of the reports resounding over the stone-built krmlin had died away the french heard a strange sound above their head thousands of crows rose above the walls and circled in the air cawing and noisily flapping their wings together with that sound came a solitary human cry from the gateway and amid the smoke appeared the figure of a bareheaded man in a peasants coat he grasped a musket and took aim at the french fire repeated the officer once more and the reports of a musket and of two cannon shots were heard simultaneously the gate was again hidden by smoke nothing more stirred behind the screens and the french infantry soldiers and officers advanced to the gate in the gateway lay three wounded and four dead two men in peasant coats ran away at the foot of the wall toward the znmenka clear that away said the officer pointing to the beams and the corpses and the french soldiers after dispatching the wounded threw the corpses over the parapet who these men were nobody knew clear that away was all that was said of them and they were thrown over the parapet and removed later on that they might not stink thiers alone dedicates a few eloquent lines to their memory these wretches had occupied the sacred citadel having supplied themselves with guns from the arsenal and fired the wretches at the french some of them were sabered and the krmlin was purged of their presence murat was informed that the way had been cleared the french entered the gates and began pitching their camp in the senate square out of the windows of the senate house the soldiers threw chairs into the square for fuel and kindled fires there other detachments passed through the krmlin and encamped along the morosyka the lubynka and pokrvka streets others quartered themselves along the vozdvzhenka the niklski and the tversky streets no masters of the houses being found anywhere the french were not billeted on the inhabitants as is usual in towns but lived in it as in a camp though tattered hungry worn out and reduced to a third of their original number the french entered moscow in good marching order it was a weary and famished but still a fighting and menacing army but it remained an army only until its soldiers had dispersed into their different lodgings as soon as the men of the various regiments began to disperse among the wealthy and deserted houses the army was lost forever and there came into being something nondescript neither citizens nor soldiers but what are known as marauders when five weeks later these same men left moscow they no longer formed an army they were a mob of marauders each carrying a quantity of articles which seemed to him valuable or useful the aim of each man when he left moscow was no longer as it had been to conquer but merely to keep what he had acquired like a monkey which puts its paw into the narrow neck of a jug and having seized a handful of nuts will not open its fist for fear of losing what it holds and therefore perishes the french when they left moscow had inevitably to perish because they carried their loot with them yet to abandon what they had stolen was as impossible for them as it is for the monkey to open its paw and let go of its nuts ten minutes after each regiment had entered a moscow district not a soldier or officer was left men in military uniforms and hessian boots could be seen through the windows laughing and walking through the rooms in cellars and storerooms similar men were busy among the provisions and in the yards unlocking or breaking open coach house and stable doors lighting fires
