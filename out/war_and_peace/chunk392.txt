two saddles and covered with a horsecloth a small samovar was produced and a cellaret and half a bottle of rum and having asked mary hendrkhovna to preside they all crowded round her one offered her a clean handkerchief to wipe her charming hands another spread a jacket under her little feet to keep them from the damp another hung his coat over the window to keep out the draft and yet another waved the flies off her husbands face lest he should wake up leave him alone said mary hendrkhovna smiling timidly and happily he is sleeping well as it is after a sleepless night oh no mary hendrkhovna replied the officer one must look after the doctor perhaps hell take pity on me someday when it comes to cutting off a leg or an arm for me there were only three tumblers the water was so muddy that one could not make out whether the tea was strong or weak and the samovar held only six tumblers of water but this made it all the pleasanter to take turns in order of seniority to receive ones tumbler from mary hendrkhovnas plump little hands with their short and not overclean nails all the officers appeared to be and really were in love with her that evening even those playing cards behind the partition soon left their game and came over to the samovar yielding to the general mood of courting mary hendrkhovna she seeing herself surrounded by such brilliant and polite young men beamed with satisfaction try as she might to hide it and perturbed as she evidently was each time her husband moved in his sleep behind her there was only one spoon sugar was more plentiful than anything else but it took too long to dissolve so it was decided that mary hendrkhovna should stir the sugar for everyone in turn rostv received his tumbler and adding some rum to it asked mary hendrkhovna to stir it but you take it without sugar she said smiling all the time as if everything she said and everything the others said was very amusing and had a double meaning it is not the sugar i want but only that your little hand should stir my tea mary hendrkhovna assented and began looking for the spoon which someone meanwhile had pounced on use your finger mary hendrkhovna it will be still nicer said rostv too hot she replied blushing with pleasure ilyn put a few drops of rum into the bucket of water and brought it to mary hendrkhovna asking her to stir it with her finger this is my cup said he only dip your finger in it and ill drink it all up when they had emptied the samovar rostv took a pack of cards and proposed that they should play kings with mary hendrkhovna they drew lots to settle who should make up her set at rostvs suggestion it was agreed that whoever became king should have the right to kiss mary hendrkhovnas hand and that the booby should go to refill and reheat the samovar for the doctor when the latter awoke well but supposing mary hendrkhovna is king asked ilyn as it is she is queen and her word is law they had hardly begun to play before the doctors disheveled head suddenly appeared from behind mary hendrkhovna he had been awake for some time listening to what was being said and evidently found nothing entertaining or amusing in what was going on his face was sad and depressed without greeting the officers he scratched himself and asked to be allowed to pass as they were blocking the way as soon as he had left the room all the officers burst into loud laughter and mary hendrkhovna blushed till her eyes filled with tears and thereby became still more attractive to them returning from the yard the doctor told his wife who had ceased to smile so happily and looked at him in alarm awaiting her sentence that the rain had ceased and they must go to sleep in their covered cart or everything in it would be stolen but ill send an orderly two of them said rostv what an idea doctor ill stand guard on it myself said ilyn no gentlemen you have had your sleep but i have not slept for two nights replied the doctor and he sat down morosely beside his wife waiting for the game to end seeing his gloomy face as he frowned at his wife the officers grew still
