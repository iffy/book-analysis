and ravski agreed with bennigsen whether feeling it necessary to make a sacrifice before abandoning the capital or guided by other personal considerations these generals seemed not to understand that this council could not alter the inevitable course of events and that moscow was in effect already abandoned the other generals however understood it and leaving aside the question of moscow spoke of the direction the army should take in its retreat malsha who kept her eyes fixed on what was going on before her understood the meaning of the council differently it seemed to her that it was only a personal struggle between granddad and long-coat as she termed bennigsen she saw that they grew spiteful when they spoke to one another and in her heart she sided with granddad in the midst of the conversation she noticed granddad give bennigsen a quick subtle glance and then to her joys she saw that granddad said something to long-coat which settled him bennigsen suddenly reddened and paced angrily up and down the room what so affected him was kutzovs calm and quiet comment on the advantage or disadvantage of bennigsens proposal to move troops by night from the right to the left flank to attack the french right wing gentlemen said kutzov i cannot approve of the counts plan moving troops in close proximity to an enemy is always dangerous and military history supports that view for instance kutzov seemed to reflect searching for an example then with a clear nave look at bennigsen he added oh yes take the battle of friedland which i think the count well remembers and which was not fully successful only because our troops were rearranged too near the enemy there followed a momentary pause which seemed very long to them all the discussion recommenced but pauses frequently occurred and they all felt that there was no more to be said during one of these pauses kutzov heaved a deep sigh as if preparing to speak they all looked at him well gentlemen i see that it is i who will have to pay for the broken crockery said he and rising slowly he moved to the table gentlemen i have heard your views some of you will not agree with me but i he paused by the authority entrusted to me by my sovereign and country order a retreat after that the generals began to disperse with the solemnity and circumspect silence of people who are leaving after a funeral some of the generals in low tones and in a strain very different from the way they had spoken during the council communicated something to their commander in chief malsha who had long been expected for supper climbed carefully backwards down from the oven her bare little feet catching at its projections and slipping between the legs of the generals she darted out of the room when he had dismissed the generals kutzov sat a long time with his elbows on the table thinking always of the same terrible question when when did the abandonment of moscow become inevitable when was that done which settled the matter and who was to blame for it i did not expect this said he to his adjutant schneider when the latter came in late that night i did not expect this i did not think this would happen you should take some rest your serene highness replied schneider but no they shall eat horseflesh yet like the turks exclaimed kutzov without replying striking the table with his podgy fist they shall too if only chapter v at that very time in circumstances even more important than retreating without a battle namely the evacuation and burning of moscow rostopchn who is usually represented as being the instigator of that event acted in an altogether different manner from kutzov after the battle of borodin the abandonment and burning of moscow was as inevitable as the retreat of the army beyond moscow without fighting every russian might have predicted it not by reasoning but by the feeling implanted in each of us and in our fathers the same thing that took place in moscow had happened in all the towns and villages on russian soil beginning with smolnsk without the participation of count rostopchn and his broadsheets the people awaited the enemy unconcernedly did not riot or become excited or tear anyone to pieces but faced its fate feeling within it the strength to find what it should do at that most difficult moment and as soon as the enemy drew
