dancing was still going on hlne not having a suitable partner herself offered to dance the mazurka with bors they were the third couple bors coolly looking at hlnes dazzling bare shoulders which emerged from a dark gold-embroidered gauze gown talked to her of old acquaintances and at the same time unaware of it himself and unnoticed by others never for an instant ceased to observe the emperor who was in the same room the emperor was not dancing he stood in the doorway stopping now one pair and now another with gracious words which he alone knew how to utter as the mazurka began bors saw that adjutant general balashv one of those in closest attendance on the emperor went up to him and contrary to court etiquette stood near him while he was talking to a polish lady having finished speaking to her the emperor looked inquiringly at balashv and evidently understanding that he only acted thus because there were important reasons for so doing nodded slightly to the lady and turned to him hardly had balashv begun to speak before a look of amazement appeared on the emperors face he took balashv by the arm and crossed the room with him unconsciously clearing a path seven yards wide as the people on both sides made way for him bors noticed arakchevs excited face when the sovereign went out with balashv arakchev looked at the emperor from under his brow and sniffing with his red nose stepped forward from the crowd as if expecting the emperor to address him bors understood that arakchev envied balashv and was displeased that evidently important news had reached the emperor otherwise than through himself but the emperor and balashv passed out into the illuminated garden without noticing arakchev who holding his sword and glancing wrathfully around followed some twenty paces behind them all the time bors was going through the figures of the mazurka he was worried by the question of what news balashv had brought and how he could find it out before others in the figure in which he had to choose two ladies he whispered to hlne that he meant to choose countess potocka who he thought had gone out onto the veranda and glided over the parquet to the door opening into the garden where seeing balashv and the emperor returning to the veranda he stood still they were moving toward the door bors fluttering as if he had not had time to withdraw respectfully pressed close to the doorpost with bowed head the emperor with the agitation of one who has been personally affronted was finishing with these words to enter russia without declaring war i will not make peace as long as a single armed enemy remains in my country it seemed to bors that it gave the emperor pleasure to utter these words he was satisfied with the form in which he had expressed his thoughts but displeased that bors had overheard it let no one know of it the emperor added with a frown bors understood that this was meant for him and closing his eyes slightly bowed his head the emperor re-entered the ballroom and remained there about another half-hour bors was thus the first to learn the news that the french army had crossed the niemen and thanks to this was able to show certain important personages that much that was concealed from others was usually known to him and by this means he rose higher in their estimation the unexpected news of the french having crossed the niemen was particularly startling after a month of unfulfilled expectations and at a ball on first receiving the news under the influence of indignation and resentment the emperor had found a phrase that pleased him fully expressed his feelings and has since become famous on returning home at two oclock that night he sent for his secretary shishkv and told him to write an order to the troops and a rescript to field marshal prince saltykv in which he insisted on the words being inserted that he would not make peace so long as a single armed frenchman remained on russian soil next day the following letter was sent to napoleon monsieur mon frre yesterday i learned that despite the loyalty with which i have kept my engagements with your majesty your troops have crossed the russian frontier and i have this moment received from petersburg a note in which count lauriston informs me as a reason for this aggression that your majesty has considered yourself
