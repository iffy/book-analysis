the prospect of a promised land to have the strength to move the promised land for the french during their advance had been moscow during their retreat it was their native land but that native land was too far off and for a man going a thousand miles it is absolutely necessary to set aside his final goal and to say to himself today i shall get to a place twenty-five miles off where i shall rest and spend the night and during the first days journey that resting place eclipses his ultimate goal and attracts all his hopes and desires and the impulses felt by a single person are always magnified in a crowd for the french retreating along the old smolnsk road the final goal their native land was too remote and their immediate goal was smolnsk toward which all their desires and hopes enormously intensified in the mass urged them on it was not that they knew that much food and fresh troops awaited them in smolnsk nor that they were told so on the contrary their superior officers and napoleon himself knew that provisions were scarce there but because this alone could give them strength to move on and endure their present privations so both those who knew and those who did not know deceived themselves and pushed on to smolnsk as to a promised land coming out onto the highroad the french fled with surprising energy and unheard-of rapidity toward the goal they had fixed on besides the common impulse which bound the whole crowd of french into one mass and supplied them with a certain energy there was another cause binding them together their great numbers as with the physical law of gravity their enormous mass drew the individual human atoms to itself in their hundreds of thousands they moved like a whole nation each of them desired nothing more than to give himself up as a prisoner to escape from all this horror and misery but on the one hand the force of this common attraction to smolnsk their goal drew each of them in the same direction on the other hand an army corps could not surrender to a company and though the french availed themselves of every convenient opportunity to detach themselves and to surrender on the slightest decent pretext such pretexts did not always occur their very numbers and their crowded and swift movement deprived them of that possibility and rendered it not only difficult but impossible for the russians to stop this movement to which the french were directing all their energies beyond a certain limit no mechanical disruption of the body could hasten the process of decomposition a lump of snow cannot be melted instantaneously there is a certain limit of time in less than which no amount of heat can melt the snow on the contrary the greater the heat the more solidified the remaining snow becomes of the russian commanders kutzov alone understood this when the flight of the french army along the smolnsk road became well defined what konovntsyn had foreseen on the night of the eleventh of october began to occur the superior officers all wanted to distinguish themselves to cut off to seize to capture and to overthrow the french and all clamored for action kutzov alone used all his power and such power is very limited in the case of any commander in chief to prevent an attack he could not tell them what we say now why fight why block the road losing our own men and inhumanly slaughtering unfortunate wretches what is the use of that when a third of their army has melted away on the road from moscow to vyzma without any battle but drawing from his aged wisdom what they could understand he told them of the golden bridge and they laughed at and slandered him flinging themselves on rending and exulting over the dying beast ermlov milordovich pltov and others in proximity to the french near vyzma could not resist their desire to cut off and break up two french corps and by way of reporting their intention to kutzov they sent him a blank sheet of paper in an envelope and try as kutzov might to restrain the troops our men attacked trying to bar the road infantry regiments we are told advanced to the attack with music and with drums beating and killed and lost thousands of men but they did not cut off or overthrow anybody and the french army closing up more firmly at
