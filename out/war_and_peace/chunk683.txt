happy i am but it cant be how happy i am no it cant be pierre kept saying as he kissed princess marys hands go to petersburg that will be best and i will write to you she said to petersburg go there very well ill go but i may come again tomorrow next day pierre came to say good-by natsha was less animated than she had been the day before but that day as he looked at her pierre sometimes felt as if he was vanishing and that neither he nor she existed any longer that nothing existed but happiness is it possible no it cant be he told himself at every look gesture and word that filled his soul with joy when on saying good-by he took her thin slender hand he could not help holding it a little longer in his own is it possible that this hand that face those eyes all this treasure of feminine charm so strange to me now is it possible that it will one day be mine forever as familiar to me as i am to myself no thats impossible good-by count she said aloud i shall look forward very much to your return she added in a whisper and these simple words her look and the expression on her face which accompanied them formed for two months the subject of inexhaustible memories interpretations and happy meditations for pierre i shall look forward very much to your return yes yes how did she say it yes i shall look forward very much to your return oh how happy i am what is happening to me how happy i am said pierre to himself chapter xix there was nothing in pierres soul now at all like what had troubled it during his courtship of hlne he did not repeat to himself with a sickening feeling of shame the words he had spoken or say oh why did i not say that and whatever made me say je vous aime on the contrary he now repeated in imagination every word that he or natsha had spoken and pictured every detail of her face and smile and did not wish to diminish or add anything but only to repeat it again and again there was now not a shadow of doubt in his mind as to whether what he had undertaken was right or wrong only one terrible doubt sometimes crossed his mind wasnt it all a dream isnt princess mary mistaken am i not too conceited and self-confident i believe all this and suddenly princess mary will tell her and she will be sure to smile and say how strange he must be deluding himself doesnt he know that he is a man just a man while i i am something altogether different and higher that was the only doubt often troubling pierre he did not now make any plans the happiness before him appeared so inconceivable that if only he could attain it it would be the end of all things everything ended with that a joyful unexpected frenzy of which he had thought himself incapable possessed him the whole meaning of life not for him alone but for the whole world seemed to him centered in his love and the possibility of being loved by her at times everybody seemed to him to be occupied with one thing only his future happiness sometimes it seemed to him that other people were all as pleased as he was himself and merely tried to hide that pleasure by pretending to be busy with other interests in every word and gesture he saw allusions to his happiness he often surprised those he met by his significantly happy looks and smiles which seemed to express a secret understanding between him and them and when he realized that people might not be aware of his happiness he pitied them with his whole heart and felt a desire somehow to explain to them that all that occupied them was a mere frivolous trifle unworthy of attention when it was suggested to him that he should enter the civil service or when the war or any general political affairs were discussed on the assumption that everybodys welfare depended on this or that issue of events he would listen with a mild and pitying smile and surprise people by his strange comments but at this time he saw everybody both those who as he imagined understood the real meaning of life that is what he was feeling and those unfortunates who
