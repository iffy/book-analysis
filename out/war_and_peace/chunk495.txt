and the shape of his head seemed strangely familiar to prince andrew several dressers were pressing on his chest to hold him down one large white plump leg twitched rapidly all the time with a feverish tremor the man was sobbing and choking convulsively two doctors one of whom was pale and trembling were silently doing something to this mans other gory leg when he had finished with the tartar whom they covered with an overcoat the spectacled doctor came up to prince andrew wiping his hands he glanced at prince andrews face and quickly turned away undress him what are you waiting for he cried angrily to the dressers his very first remotest recollections of childhood came back to prince andrews mind when the dresser with sleeves rolled up began hastily to undo the buttons of his clothes and undressed him the doctor bent down over the wound felt it and sighed deeply then he made a sign to someone and the torturing pain in his abdomen caused prince andrew to lose consciousness when he came to himself the splintered portions of his thighbone had been extracted the torn flesh cut away and the wound bandaged water was being sprinkled on his face as soon as prince andrew opened his eyes the doctor bent over kissed him silently on the lips and hurried away after the sufferings he had been enduring prince andrew enjoyed a blissful feeling such as he had not experienced for a long time all the best and happiest moments of his life especially his earliest childhood when he used to be undressed and put to bed and when leaning over him his nurse sang him to sleep and he burying his head in the pillow felt happy in the mere consciousness of life returned to his memory not merely as something past but as something present the doctors were busily engaged with the wounded man the shape of whose head seemed familiar to prince andrew they were lifting him up and trying to quiet him show it to me oh ooh oh oh ooh his frightened moans could be heard subdued by suffering and broken by sobs hearing those moans prince andrew wanted to weep whether because he was dying without glory or because he was sorry to part with life or because of those memories of a childhood that could not return or because he was suffering and others were suffering and that man near him was groaning so piteously he felt like weeping childlike kindly and almost happy tears the wounded man was shown his amputated leg stained with clotted blood and with the boot still on oh oh ooh he sobbed like a woman the doctor who had been standing beside him preventing prince andrew from seeing his face moved away my god what is this why is he here said prince andrew to himself in the miserable sobbing enfeebled man whose leg had just been amputated he recognized anatole kurgin men were supporting him in their arms and offering him a glass of water but his trembling swollen lips could not grasp its rim anatole was sobbing painfully yes it is he yes that man is somehow closely and painfully connected with me thought prince andrew not yet clearly grasping what he saw before him what is the connection of that man with my childhood and life he asked himself without finding an answer and suddenly a new unexpected memory from that realm of pure and loving childhood presented itself to him he remembered natsha as he had seen her for the first time at the ball in with her slender neck and arms and with a frightened happy face ready for rapture and love and tenderness for her stronger and more vivid than ever awoke in his soul he now remembered the connection that existed between himself and this man who was dimly gazing at him through tears that filled his swollen eyes he remembered everything and ecstatic pity and love for that man overflowed his happy heart prince andrew could no longer restrain himself and wept tender loving tears for his fellow men for himself and for his own and their errors compassion love of our brothers for those who love us and for those who hate us love of our enemies yes that love which god preached on earth and which princess mary taught me and i did not understand that is what made me sorry to part with life that is what remained for me had i lived but
