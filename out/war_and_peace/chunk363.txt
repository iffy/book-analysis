he is here now tell him to for forgive me she stopped and breathed still more quickly but did not shed tears yes i will tell him answered pierre but he did not know what to say natsha was evidently dismayed at the thought of what he might think she had meant no i know all is over she said hurriedly no that can never be im only tormented by the wrong i have done him tell him only that i beg him to forgive forgive forgive me for everything she trembled all over and sat down on a chair a sense of pity he had never before known overflowed pierres heart i will tell him i will tell him everything once more said pierre but i should like to know one thing know what natshas eyes asked i should like to know did you love pierre did not know how to refer to anatole and flushed at the thought of him did you love that bad man dont call him bad said natsha but i dont know dont know at all she began to cry and a still greater sense of pity tenderness and love welled up in pierre he felt the tears trickle under his spectacles and hoped they would not be noticed we wont speak of it any more my dear said pierre and his gentle cordial tone suddenly seemed very strange to natsha we wont speak of it my dear ill tell him everything but one thing i beg of you consider me your friend and if you want help advice or simply to open your heart to someone not now but when your mind is clearer--think of me he took her hand and kissed it i shall be happy if its in my power pierre grew confused dont speak to me like that i am not worth it exclaimed natsha and turned to leave the room but pierre held her hand he knew he had something more to say to her but when he said it he was amazed at his own words stop stop you have your whole life before you said he to her before me no all is over for me she replied with shame and self-abasement all over he repeated if i were not myself but the handsomest cleverest and best man in the world and were free i would this moment ask on my knees for your hand and your love for the first time for many days natsha wept tears of gratitude and tenderness and glancing at pierre she went out of the room pierre too when she had gone almost ran into the anteroom restraining tears of tenderness and joy that choked him and without finding the sleeves of his fur cloak threw it on and got into his sleigh where to now your excellency asked the coachman where to pierre asked himself where can i go now surely not to the club or to pay calls all men seemed so pitiful so poor in comparison with this feeling of tenderness and love he experienced in comparison with that softened grateful last look she had given him through her tears home said pierre and despite twenty-two degrees of frost fahrenheit he threw open the bearskin cloak from his broad chest and inhaled the air with joy it was clear and frosty above the dirty ill-lit streets above the black roofs stretched the dark starry sky only looking up at the sky did pierre cease to feel how sordid and humiliating were all mundane things compared with the heights to which his soul had just been raised at the entrance to the arbt square an immense expanse of dark starry sky presented itself to his eyes almost in the center of it above the prechstenka boulevard surrounded and sprinkled on all sides by stars but distinguished from them all by its nearness to the earth its white light and its long uplifted tail shone the enormous and brilliant comet of the comet which was said to portend all kinds of woes and the end of the world in pierre however that comet with its long luminous tail aroused no feeling of fear on the contrary he gazed joyfully his eyes moist with tears at this bright comet which having traveled in its orbit with inconceivable velocity through immeasurable space seemed suddenly like an arrow piercing the earth to remain fixed in a chosen spot vigorously holding its tail erect shining and displaying its white light amid countless other scintillating stars it
