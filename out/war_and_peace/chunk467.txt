xxiii from grki bennigsen descended the highroad to the bridge which when they had looked at it from the hill the officer had pointed out as being the center of our position and where rows of fragrant new-mown hay lay by the riverside they rode across that bridge into the village of borodin and thence turned to the left passing an enormous number of troops and guns and came to a high knoll where militiamen were digging this was the redoubt as yet unnamed which afterwards became known as the ravski redoubt or the knoll battery but pierre paid no special attention to it he did not know that it would become more memorable to him than any other spot on the plain of borodin they then crossed the hollow to semnovsk where the soldiers were dragging away the last logs from the huts and barns then they rode downhill and uphill across a ryefield trodden and beaten down as if by hail following a track freshly made by the artillery over the furrows of the plowed land and reached some flches which were still being dug a kind of entrenchment at the flches bennigsen stopped and began looking at the shevrdino redoubt opposite which had been ours the day before and where several horsemen could be descried the officers said that either napoleon or murat was there and they all gazed eagerly at this little group of horsemen pierre also looked at them trying to guess which of the scarcely discernible figures was napoleon at last those mounted men rode away from the mound and disappeared bennigsen spoke to a general who approached him and began explaining the whole position of our troops pierre listened to him straining each faculty to understand the essential points of the impending battle but was mortified to feel that his mental capacity was inadequate for the task he could make nothing of it bennigsen stopped speaking and noticing that pierre was listening suddenly said to him i dont think this interests you on the contrary its very interesting replied pierre not quite truthfully from the flches they rode still farther to the left along a road winding through a thick low-growing birch wood in the middle of the wood a brown hare with white feet sprang out and scared by the tramp of the many horses grew so confused that it leaped along the road in front of them for some time arousing general attention and laughter and only when several voices shouted at it did it dart to one side and disappear in the thicket after going through the wood for about a mile and a half they came out on a glade where troops of tchkovs corps were stationed to defend the left flank here at the extreme left flank bennigsen talked a great deal and with much heat and as it seemed to pierre gave orders of great military importance in front of tchkovs troops was some high ground not occupied by troops bennigsen loudly criticized this mistake saying that it was madness to leave a height which commanded the country around unoccupied and to place troops below it some of the generals expressed the same opinion one in particular declared with martial heat that they were put there to be slaughtered bennigsen on his own authority ordered the troops to occupy the high ground this disposition on the left flank increased pierres doubt of his own capacity to understand military matters listening to bennigsen and the generals criticizing the position of the troops behind the hill he quite understood them and shared their opinion but for that very reason he could not understand how the man who put them there behind the hill could have made so gross and palpable a blunder pierre did not know that these troops were not as bennigsen supposed put there to defend the position but were in a concealed position as an ambush that they should not be seen and might be able to strike an approaching enemy unexpectedly bennigsen did not know this and moved the troops forward according to his own ideas without mentioning the matter to the commander in chief chapter xxiv on that bright evening of august prince andrew lay leaning on his elbow in a broken-down shed in the village of knyazkvo at the further end of his regiments encampment through a gap in the broken wall he could see beside the wooden fence a row of thirty-year-old birches with their lower branches lopped off a field on which shocks
