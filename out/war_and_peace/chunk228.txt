pierre with an ironic smile when you see my sister princess mary youll get on with her he said perhaps you are right for yourself he added after a short pause but everyone lives in his own way you lived for yourself and say you nearly ruined your life and only found happiness when you began living for others i experienced just the reverse i lived for glory and after all what is glory the same love of others a desire to do something for them a desire for their approval so i lived for others and not almost but quite ruined my life and i have become calmer since i began to live only for myself but what do you mean by living only for yourself asked pierre growing excited what about your son your sister and your father but thats just the same as myself they are not others explained prince andrew the others ones neighbors le prochain as you and princess mary call it are the chief source of all error and evil le prochain your kiev peasants to whom you want to do good and he looked at pierre with a mocking challenging expression he evidently wished to draw him on you are joking replied pierre growing more and more excited what error or evil can there be in my wishing to do good and even doing a little though i did very little and did it very badly what evil can there be in it if unfortunate people our serfs people like ourselves were growing up and dying with no idea of god and truth beyond ceremonies and meaningless prayers and are now instructed in a comforting belief in future life retribution recompense and consolation what evil and error are there in it if people were dying of disease without help while material assistance could so easily be rendered and i supplied them with a doctor a hospital and an asylum for the aged and is it not a palpable unquestionable good if a peasant or a woman with a baby has no rest day or night and i give them rest and leisure said pierre hurrying and lisping and i have done that though badly and to a small extent but i have done something toward it and you cannot persuade me that it was not a good action and more than that you cant make me believe that you do not think so yourself and the main thing is he continued that i know and know for certain that the enjoyment of doing this good is the only sure happiness in life yes if you put it like that its quite a different matter said prince andrew i build a house and lay out a garden and you build hospitals the one and the other may serve as a pastime but whats right and whats good must be judged by one who knows all but not by us well you want an argument he added come on then they rose from the table and sat down in the entrance porch which served as a veranda come lets argue then said prince andrew you talk of schools he went on crooking a finger education and so forth that is you want to raise him pointing to a peasant who passed by them taking off his cap from his animal condition and awaken in him spiritual needs while it seems to me that animal happiness is the only happiness possible and that is just what you want to deprive him of i envy him but you want to make him what i am without giving him my means then you say lighten his toil but as i see it physical labor is as essential to him as much a condition of his existence as mental activity is to you or me you cant help thinking i go to bed after two in the morning thoughts come and i cant sleep but toss about till dawn because i think and cant help thinking just as he cant help plowing and mowing if he didnt he would go to the drink shop or fall ill just as i could not stand his terrible physical labor but should die of it in a week so he could not stand my physical idleness but would grow fat and die the third thing what else was it you talked about and prince andrew crooked a third finger ah yes hospitals medicine he has a fit he is dying and you come and
