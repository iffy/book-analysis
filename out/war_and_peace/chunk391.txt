hearing though with no intention of contradicting it since the campaigns of austerlitz and of rostv knew by experience that men always lie when describing military exploits as he himself had done when recounting them besides that he had experience enough to know that nothing happens in war at all as we can imagine or relate it and so he did not like zdrzhinskis tale nor did he like zdrzhinski himself who with his mustaches extending over his cheeks bent low over the face of his hearer as was his habit and crowded rostv in the narrow shanty rostv looked at him in silence in the first place there must have been such a confusion and crowding on the dam that was being attacked that if ravski did lead his sons there it could have had no effect except perhaps on some dozen men nearest to him thought he the rest could not have seen how or with whom ravski came onto the dam and even those who did see it would not have been much stimulated by it for what had they to do with ravskis tender paternal feelings when their own skins were in danger and besides the fate of the fatherland did not depend on whether they took the saltnov dam or not as we are told was the case at thermopylae so why should he have made such a sacrifice and why expose his own children in the battle i would not have taken my brother ptya there or even ilyn whos a stranger to me but a nice lad but would have tried to put them somewhere under cover nicholas continued to think as he listened to zdrzhinski but he did not express his thoughts for in such matters too he had gained experience he knew that this tale redounded to the glory of our arms and so one had to pretend not to doubt it and he acted accordingly i cant stand this any more said ilyn noticing that rostv did not relish zdrzhinskis conversation my stockings and shirt and the water is running on my seat ill go and look for shelter the rain seems less heavy ilyn went out and zdrzhinski rode away five minutes later ilyn splashing through the mud came running back to the shanty hurrah rostv come quick ive found it about two hundred yards away theres a tavern where ours have already gathered we can at least get dry there and mary hendrkhovnas there mary hendrkhovna was the wife of the regimental doctor a pretty young german woman he had married in poland the doctor whether from lack of means or because he did not like to part from his young wife in the early days of their marriage took her about with him wherever the hussar regiment went and his jealousy had become a standing joke among the hussar officers rostv threw his cloak over his shoulders shouted to lavrshka to follow with the things and now slipping in the mud now splashing right through it set off with ilyn in the lessening rain and the darkness that was occasionally rent by distant lightning rostv where are you here what lightning they called to one another chapter xiii in the tavern before which stood the doctors covered cart there were already some five officers mary hendrkhovna a plump little blonde german in a dressing jacket and nightcap was sitting on a broad bench in the front corner her husband the doctor lay asleep behind her rostv and ilyn on entering the room were welcomed with merry shouts and laughter dear me how jolly we are said rostv laughing and why do you stand there gaping what swells they are why the water streams from them dont make our drawing room so wet dont mess mary hendrkhovnas dress cried other voices rostv and ilyn hastened to find a corner where they could change into dry clothes without offending mary hendrkhovnas modesty they were going into a tiny recess behind a partition to change but found it completely filled by three officers who sat playing cards by the light of a solitary candle on an empty box and these officers would on no account yield their position mary hendrkhovna obliged them with the loan of a petticoat to be used as a curtain and behind that screen rostv and ilyn helped by lavrshka who had brought their kits changed their wet things for dry ones a fire was made up in the dilapidated brick stove a board was found fixed on
