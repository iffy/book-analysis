yes i will give them just laws i will teach them the meaning of true civilization i will make generations of boyars remember their conqueror with love i will tell the deputation that i did not and do not desire war that i have waged war only against the false policy of their court that i love and respect alexander and that in moscow i will accept terms of peace worthy of myself and of my people i do not wish to utilize the fortunes of war to humiliate an honored monarch boyars i will say to them i do not desire war i desire the peace and welfare of all my subjects however i know their presence will inspire me and i shall speak to them as i always do clearly impressively and majestically but can it be true that i am in moscow yes there she lies quon mamne les boyars said he to his suite bring the boyars to me a general with a brilliant suite galloped off at once to fetch the boyars two hours passed napoleon had lunched and was again standing in the same place on the poklnny hill awaiting the deputation his speech to the boyars had already taken definite shape in his imagination that speech was full of dignity and greatness as napoleon understood it he was himself carried away by the tone of magnanimity he intended to adopt toward moscow in his imagination he appointed days for assemblies at the palace of the tsars at which russian notables and his own would mingle he mentally appointed a governor one who would win the hearts of the people having learned that there were many charitable institutions in moscow he mentally decided that he would shower favors on them all he thought that as in africa he had to put on a burnoose and sit in a mosque so in moscow he must be beneficent like the tsars and in order finally to touch the hearts of the russians and being like all frenchmen unable to imagine anything sentimental without a reference to ma chre ma tendre ma pauvre mre he decided that he would place an inscription on all these establishments in large letters this establishment is dedicated to my dear mother or no it should be simply maison de ma mre he concluded but am i really in moscow yes here it lies before me but why is the deputation from the city so long in appearing he wondered my dear my tender my poor mother house of my mother meanwhile an agitated consultation was being carried on in whispers among his generals and marshals at the rear of his suite those sent to fetch the deputation had returned with the news that moscow was empty that everyone had left it the faces of those who were not conferring together were pale and perturbed they were not alarmed by the fact that moscow had been abandoned by its inhabitants grave as that fact seemed but by the question how to tell the emperor without putting him in the terrible position of appearing ridiculous that he had been awaiting the boyars so long in vain that there were drunken mobs left in moscow but no one else some said that a deputation of some sort must be scraped together others disputed that opinion and maintained that the emperor should first be carefully and skillfully prepared and then told the truth he will have to be told all the same said some gentlemen of the suite but gentlemen the position was the more awkward because the emperor meditating upon his magnanimous plans was pacing patiently up and down before the outspread map occasionally glancing along the road to moscow from under his lifted hand with a bright and proud smile but its impossible declared the gentlemen of the suite shrugging their shoulders but not venturing to utter the implied word le ridicule at last the emperor tired of futile expectation his actors instinct suggesting to him that the sublime moment having been too long drawn out was beginning to lose its sublimity gave a sign with his hand a single report of a signaling gun followed and the troops who were already spread out on different sides of moscow moved into the city through the tver kalga and dorogomlov gates faster and faster vying with one another they moved at the double or at a trot vanishing amid the clouds of dust they raised and making the air ring with a deafening roar of mingling
