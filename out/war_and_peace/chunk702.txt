bond between her own body and soul to fluff out her curls put on fashionable dresses and sing romantic songs to fascinate her husband would have seemed as strange as to adorn herself to attract herself to adorn herself for others might perhaps have been agreeable she did not know but she had no time at all for it the chief reason for devoting no time either to singing to dress or to choosing her words was that she really had no time to spare for these things we know that man has the faculty of becoming completely absorbed in a subject however trivial it may be and that there is no subject so trivial that it will not grow to infinite proportions if ones entire attention is devoted to it the subject which wholly engrossed natshas attention was her family that is her husband whom she had to keep so that he should belong entirely to her and to the home and the children whom she had to bear bring into the world nurse and bring up and the deeper she penetrated not with her mind only but with her whole soul her whole being into the subject that absorbed her the larger did that subject grow and the weaker and more inadequate did her powers appear so that she concentrated them wholly on that one thing and yet was unable to accomplish all that she considered necessary there were then as now conversations and discussions about womens rights the relations of husband and wife and their freedom and rights though these themes were not yet termed questions as they are now but these topics were not merely uninteresting to natsha she positively did not understand them these questions then as now existed only for those who see nothing in marriage but the pleasure married people get from one another that is only the beginnings of marriage and not its whole significance which lies in the family discussions and questions of that kind which are like the question of how to get the greatest gratification from ones dinner did not then and do not now exist for those for whom the purpose of a dinner is the nourishment it affords and the purpose of marriage is the family if the purpose of dinner is to nourish the body a man who eats two dinners at once may perhaps get more enjoyment but will not attain his purpose for his stomach will not digest the two dinners if the purpose of marriage is the family the person who wishes to have many wives or husbands may perhaps obtain much pleasure but in that case will not have a family if the purpose of food is nourishment and the purpose of marriage is the family the whole question resolves itself into not eating more than one can digest and not having more wives or husbands than are needed for the family that is one wife or one husband natsha needed a husband a husband was given her and he gave her a family and she not only saw no need of any other or better husband but as all the powers of her soul were intent on serving that husband and family she could not imagine and saw no interest in imagining how it would be if things were different natsha did not care for society in general but prized the more the society of her relatives countess mary and her brother her mother and snya she valued the company of those to whom she could come striding disheveled from the nursery in her dressing gown and with joyful face show a yellow instead of a green stain on babys napkin and from whom she could hear reassuring words to the effect that baby was much better to such an extent had natsha let herself go that the way she dressed and did her hair her ill-chosen words and her jealousy she was jealous of snya of the governess and of every woman pretty or plain were habitual subjects of jest to those about her the general opinion was that pierre was under his wifes thumb which was really true from the very first days of their married life natsha had announced her demands pierre was greatly surprised by his wifes view to him a perfectly novel one that every moment of his life belonged to her and to the family his wifes demands astonished him but they also flattered him and he submitted to them pierres subjection consisted in the fact that
