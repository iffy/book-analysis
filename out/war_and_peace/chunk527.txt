therefore waited calmly for what would happen with more patience than the horses especially the near one the chestnut falcon who was pawing the ground and champing his bit at last all were seated the carriage steps were folded and pulled up the door was shut somebody was sent for a traveling case and the countess leaned out and said what she had to say then efm deliberately doffed his hat and began crossing himself the postilion and all the other servants did the same off in gods name said efm putting on his hat start the postilion started the horses the off pole horse tugged at his collar the high springs creaked and the body of the coach swayed the footman sprang onto the box of the moving coach which jolted as it passed out of the yard onto the uneven roadway the other vehicles jolted in their turn and the procession of carriages moved up the street in the carriages the calche and the phaeton all crossed themselves as they passed the church opposite the house those who were to remain in moscow walked on either side of the vehicles seeing the travelers off rarely had natsha experienced so joyful a feeling as now sitting in the carriage beside the countess and gazing at the slowly receding walls of forsaken agitated moscow occasionally she leaned out of the carriage window and looked back and then forward at the long train of wounded in front of them almost at the head of the line she could see the raised hood of prince andrews calche she did not know who was in it but each time she looked at the procession her eyes sought that calche she knew it was right in front in kdrino from the niktski prsnya and podnovnsk streets came several other trains of vehicles similar to the rostvs and as they passed along the sadvaya street the carriages and carts formed two rows abreast as they were going round the skharev water tower natsha who was inquisitively and alertly scrutinizing the people driving or walking past suddenly cried out in joyful surprise dear me mamma snya look its he who who look yes on my word its bezkhov said natsha putting her head out of the carriage and staring at a tall stout man in a coachmans long coat who from his manner of walking and moving was evidently a gentleman in disguise and who was passing under the arch of the skharev tower accompanied by a small sallow-faced beardless old man in a frieze coat yes it really is bezkhov in a coachmans coat with a queer-looking old boy really said natsha look look no its not he how can you talk such nonsense mamma screamed natsha ill stake my head its he i assure you stop stop she cried to the coachman but the coachman could not stop for from the meshchnski street came more carts and carriages and the rostvs were being shouted at to move on and not block the way in fact however though now much farther off than before the rostvs all saw pierre or someone extraordinarily like him in a coachmans coat going down the street with head bent and a serious face beside a small beardless old man who looked like a footman that old man noticed a face thrust out of the carriage window gazing at them and respectfully touching pierres elbow said something to him and pointed to the carriage pierre evidently engrossed in thought could not at first understand him at length when he had understood and looked in the direction the old man indicated he recognized natsha and following his first impulse stepped instantly and rapidly toward the coach but having taken a dozen steps he seemed to remember something and stopped natshas face leaning out of the window beamed with quizzical kindliness peter kirlovich come here we have recognized you this is wonderful she cried holding out her hand to him what are you doing why are you like this pierre took her outstretched hand and kissed it awkwardly as he walked along beside her while the coach still moved on what is the matter count asked the countess in a surprised and commiserating tone what what why dont ask me said pierre and looked round at natsha whose radiant happy expression of which he was conscious without looking at her filled him with enchantment are you remaining in moscow then pierre hesitated in moscow he said in a questioning tone yes in moscow good-by
