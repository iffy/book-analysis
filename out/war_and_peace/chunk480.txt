cap with a red band was visible his gray nape sunk between his shoulders he was looking through a field glass down the highroad before him mounting the steps to the knoll pierre looked at the scene before him spellbound by beauty it was the same panorama he had admired from that spot the day before but now the whole place was full of troops and covered by smoke clouds from the guns and the slanting rays of the bright sun rising slightly to the left behind pierre cast upon it through the clear morning air penetrating streaks of rosy golden-tinted light and long dark shadows the forest at the farthest extremity of the panorama seemed carved in some precious stone of a yellowish-green color its undulating outline was silhouetted against the horizon and was pierced beyond valevo by the smolnsk highroad crowded with troops nearer at hand glittered golden cornfields interspersed with copses there were troops to be seen everywhere in front and to the right and left all this was vivid majestic and unexpected but what impressed pierre most of all was the view of the battlefield itself of borodin and the hollows on both sides of the koloch above the koloch in borodin and on both sides of it especially to the left where the vyna flowing between its marshy banks falls into the koloch a mist had spread which seemed to melt to dissolve and to become translucent when the brilliant sun appeared and magically colored and outlined everything the smoke of the guns mingled with this mist and over the whole expanse and through that mist the rays of the morning sun were reflected flashing back like lightning from the water from the dew and from the bayonets of the troops crowded together by the riverbanks and in borodin a white church could be seen through the mist and here and there the roofs of huts in borodin as well as dense masses of soldiers or green ammunition chests and ordnance and all this moved or seemed to move as the smoke and mist spread out over the whole space just as in the mist-enveloped hollow near borodin so along the entire line outside and above it and especially in the woods and fields to the left in the valleys and on the summits of the high ground clouds of powder smoke seemed continually to spring up out of nothing now singly now several at a time some translucent others dense which swelling growing rolling and blending extended over the whole expanse these puffs of smoke and strange to say the sound of the firing produced the chief beauty of the spectacle puff suddenly a round compact cloud of smoke was seen merging from violet into gray and milky white and boom came the report a second later puff puff and two clouds arose pushing one another and blending together and boom boom came the sounds confirming what the eye had seen pierre glanced round at the first cloud which he had seen as a round compact ball and in its place already were balloons of smoke floating to one side and puff with a pause puff puff three and then four more appeared and then from each with the same interval boom boom boom came the fine firm precise sounds in reply it seemed as if those smoke clouds sometimes ran and sometimes stood still while woods fields and glittering bayonets ran past them from the left over fields and bushes those large balls of smoke were continually appearing followed by their solemn reports while nearer still in the hollows and woods there burst from the muskets small cloudlets that had no time to become balls but had their little echoes in just the same way trakh-ta-ta-takh came the frequent crackle of musketry but it was irregular and feeble in comparison with the reports of the cannon pierre wished to be there with that smoke those shining bayonets that movement and those sounds he turned to look at kutzov and his suite to compare his impressions with those of others they were all looking at the field of battle as he was and as it seemed to him with the same feelings all their faces were now shining with that latent warmth of feeling pierre had noticed the day before and had fully understood after his talk with prince andrew go my dear fellow go and christ be with you kutzov was saying to a general who stood beside him not taking his eye from the
