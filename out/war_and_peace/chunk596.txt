know what to say to him when nicholas had been led away princess mary again went up to her brother kissed him and unable to restrain her tears any longer began to cry he looked at her attentively is it about nicholas he asked princess mary nodded her head weeping mary you know the gosp but he broke off what did you say nothing you mustnt cry here he said looking at her with the same cold expression when princess mary began to cry he understood that she was crying at the thought that little nicholas would be left without a father with a great effort he tried to return to life and to see things from their point of view yes to them it must seem sad he thought but how simple it is the fowls of the air sow not neither do they reap yet your father feedeth them he said to himself and wished to say to princess mary but no they will take it their own way they wont understand they cant understand that all those feelings they prize so all our feelings all those ideas that seem so important to us are unnecessary we cannot understand one another and he remained silent prince andrews little son was seven he could scarcely read and knew nothing after that day he lived through many things gaining knowledge observation and experience but had he possessed all the faculties he afterwards acquired he could not have had a better or more profound understanding of the meaning of the scene he had witnessed between his father mary and natsha than he had then he understood it completely and leaving the room without crying went silently up to natsha who had come out with him and looked shyly at her with his beautiful thoughtful eyes then his uplifted rosy upper lip trembled and leaning his head against her he began to cry after that he avoided dessalles and the countess who caressed him and either sat alone or came timidly to princess mary or to natsha of whom he seemed even fonder than of his aunt and clung to them quietly and shyly when princess mary had left prince andrew she fully understood what natshas face had told her she did not speak any more to natsha of hopes of saving his life she took turns with her beside his sofa and did not cry any more but prayed continually turning in soul to that eternal and unfathomable whose presence above the dying man was now so evident chapter xvi not only did prince andrew know he would die but he felt that he was dying and was already half dead he was conscious of an aloofness from everything earthly and a strange and joyous lightness of existence without haste or agitation he awaited what was coming that inexorable eternal distant and unknown the presence of which he had felt continually all his life was now near to him and by the strange lightness he experienced almost comprehensible and palpable formerly he had feared the end he had twice experienced that terribly tormenting fear of death the end but now he no longer understood that fear he had felt it for the first time when the shell spun like a top before him and he looked at the fallow field the bushes and the sky and knew that he was face to face with death when he came to himself after being wounded and the flower of eternal unfettered love had instantly unfolded itself in his soul as if freed from the bondage of life that had restrained it he no longer feared death and ceased to think about it during the hours of solitude suffering and partial delirium he spent after he was wounded the more deeply he penetrated into the new principle of eternal love revealed to him the more he unconsciously detached himself from earthly life to love everything and everybody and always to sacrifice oneself for love meant not to love anyone not to live this earthly life and the more imbued he became with that principle of love the more he renounced life and the more completely he destroyed that dreadful barrier which in the absence of such love stands between life and death when during those first days he remembered that he would have to die he said to himself well what of it so much the better but after the night in mytshchi when half delirious he had seen her for whom he longed appear before
