natsha were invited to a big dinner party at the kargins and mrya dmtrievna took them there at that party natsha again met anatole and snya noticed that she spoke to him trying not to be overheard and that all through dinner she was more agitated than ever when they got home natsha was the first to begin the explanation snya expected there snya you were talking all sorts of nonsense about him natsha began in a mild voice such as children use when they wish to be praised we have had an explanation today well what happened what did he say natsha how glad i am youre not angry with me tell me everything the whole truth what did he say natsha became thoughtful oh snya if you knew him as i do he said he asked me what i had promised bolknski he was glad i was free to refuse him snya sighed sorrowfully but you havent refused bolknski said she perhaps i have perhaps all is over between me and bolknski why do you think so badly of me i dont think anything only i dont understand this wait a bit snya youll understand everything youll see what a man he is now dont think badly of me or of him i dont think badly of anyone i love and pity everybody but what am i to do snya did not succumb to the tender tone natsha used toward her the more emotional and ingratiating the expression of natshas face became the more serious and stern grew snyas natsha said she you asked me not to speak to you and i havent spoken but now you yourself have begun i dont trust him natsha why this secrecy again again interrupted natsha natsha i am afraid for you afraid of what i am afraid youre going to your ruin said snya resolutely and was herself horrified at what she had said anger again showed in natshas face and ill go to my ruin i will as soon as possible its not your business it wont be you but i wholl suffer leave me alone leave me alone i hate you natsha moaned snya aghast i hate you i hate you youre my enemy forever and natsha ran out of the room natsha did not speak to snya again and avoided her with the same expression of agitated surprise and guilt she went about the house taking up now one occupation now another and at once abandoning them hard as it was for snya she watched her friend and did not let her out of her sight the day before the count was to return snya noticed that natsha sat by the drawing room window all the morning as if expecting something and that she made a sign to an officer who drove past whom snya took to be anatole snya began watching her friend still more attentively and noticed that at dinner and all that evening natsha was in a strange and unnatural state she answered questions at random began sentences she did not finish and laughed at everything after tea snya noticed a housemaid at natshas door timidly waiting to let her pass she let the girl go in and then listening at the door learned that another letter had been delivered then suddenly it became clear to snya that natsha had some dreadful plan for that evening snya knocked at her door natsha did not let her in she will run away with him thought snya she is capable of anything there was something particularly pathetic and resolute in her face today she cried as she said good-by to uncle snya remembered yes thats it she means to elope with him but what am i to do thought she recalling all the signs that clearly indicated that natsha had some terrible intention the count is away what am i to do write to kurgin demanding an explanation but what is there to oblige him to reply write to pierre as prince andrew asked me to in case of some misfortune but perhaps she really has already refused bolknski she sent a letter to princess mary yesterday and uncle is away to tell mrya dmtrievna who had such faith in natsha seemed to snya terrible well anyway thought snya as she stood in the dark passage now or never i must prove that i remember the familys goodness to me and that i love nicholas yes if i dont sleep for three nights ill not leave this passage and
