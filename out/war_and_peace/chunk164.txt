passed in step before the emperors and their suites at a bold brisk pace lads shouted milordovich in a loud self-confident and cheery voice obviously so elated by the sound of firing by the prospect of battle and by the sight of the gallant psherons his comrades in suvrovs time now passing so gallantly before the emperors that he forgot the sovereigns presence lads its not the first village youve had to take cried he glad to do our best shouted the soldiers the emperors horse started at the sudden cry this horse that had carried the sovereign at reviews in russia bore him also here on the field of austerlitz enduring the heedless blows of his left foot and pricking its ears at the sound of shots just as it had done on the empress field not understanding the significance of the firing nor of the nearness of the emperor francis black cob nor of all that was being said thought and felt that day by its rider the emperor turned with a smile to one of his followers and made a remark to him pointing to the gallant psherons chapter xvi kutzov accompanied by his adjutants rode at a walking pace behind the carabineers when he had gone less than half a mile in the rear of the column he stopped at a solitary deserted house that had probably once been an inn where two roads parted both of them led downhill and troops were marching along both the fog had begun to clear and enemy troops were already dimly visible about a mile and a half off on the opposite heights down below on the left the firing became more distinct kutzov had stopped and was speaking to an austrian general prince andrew who was a little behind looking at them turned to an adjutant to ask him for a field glass look look said this adjutant looking not at the troops in the distance but down the hill before him its the french the two generals and the adjutant took hold of the field glass trying to snatch it from one another the expression on all their faces suddenly changed to one of horror the french were supposed to be a mile and a half away but had suddenly and unexpectedly appeared just in front of us its the enemy no yes see it is for certain but how is that said different voices with the naked eye prince andrew saw below them to the right not more than five hundred paces from where kutzov was standing a dense french column coming up to meet the psherons here it is the decisive moment has arrived my turn has come thought prince andrew and striking his horse he rode up to kutzov the psherons must be stopped your excellency cried he but at that very instant a cloud of smoke spread all round firing was heard quite close at hand and a voice of nave terror barely two steps from prince andrew shouted brothers alls lost and at this as if at a command everyone began to run confused and ever-increasing crowds were running back to where five minutes before the troops had passed the emperors not only would it have been difficult to stop that crowd it was even impossible not to be carried back with it oneself bolknski only tried not to lose touch with it and looked around bewildered and unable to grasp what was happening in front of him nesvtski with an angry face red and unlike himself was shouting to kutzov that if he did not ride away at once he would certainly be taken prisoner kutzov remained in the same place and without answering drew out a handkerchief blood was flowing from his cheek prince andrew forced his way to him you are wounded he asked hardly able to master the trembling of his lower jaw the wound is not here it is there said kutzov pressing the handkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing soldiers stop them he shouted and at the same moment probably realizing that it was impossible to stop them spurred his horse and rode to the right a fresh wave of the flying mob caught him and bore him back with it the troops were running in such a dense mass that once surrounded by them it was difficult to get out again one was shouting get on why are you hindering us another in the same place turned round and fired in the air
