with a flag of truce demanding an audience with the russian emperor was brought into wischau from our outposts this officer was savary the emperor had only just fallen asleep and so savary had to wait at midday he was admitted to the emperor and an hour later he rode off with prince dolgorkov to the advanced post of the french army it was rumored that savary had been sent to propose to alexander a meeting with napoleon to the joy and pride of the whole army a personal interview was refused and instead of the sovereign prince dolgorkov the victor at wischau was sent with savary to negotiate with napoleon if contrary to expectations these negotiations were actuated by a real desire for peace toward evening dolgorkov came back went straight to the tsar and remained alone with him for a long time on the eighteenth and nineteenth of november the army advanced two days march and the enemys outposts after a brief interchange of shots retreated in the highest army circles from midday on the nineteenth a great excitedly bustling activity began which lasted till the morning of the twentieth when the memorable battle of austerlitz was fought till midday on the nineteenth the activity the eager talk running to and fro and dispatching of adjutants was confined to the emperors headquarters but on the afternoon of that day this activity reached kutzovs headquarters and the staffs of the commanders of columns by evening the adjutants had spread it to all ends and parts of the army and in the night from the nineteenth to the twentieth the whole eighty thousand allied troops rose from their bivouacs to the hum of voices and the army swayed and started in one enormous mass six miles long the concentrated activity which had begun at the emperors headquarters in the morning and had started the whole movement that followed was like the first movement of the main wheel of a large tower clock one wheel slowly moved another was set in motion and a third and wheels began to revolve faster and faster levers and cogwheels to work chimes to play figures to pop out and the hands to advance with regular motion as a result of all that activity just as in the mechanism of a clock so in the mechanism of the military machine an impulse once given leads to the final result and just as indifferently quiescent till the moment when motion is transmitted to them are the parts of the mechanism which the impulse has not yet reached wheels creak on their axles as the cogs engage one another and the revolving pulleys whirr with the rapidity of their movement but a neighboring wheel is as quiet and motionless as though it were prepared to remain so for a hundred years but the moment comes when the lever catches it and obeying the impulse that wheel begins to creak and joins in the common motion the result and aim of which are beyond its ken just as in a clock the result of the complicated motion of innumerable wheels and pulleys is merely a slow and regular movement of the hands which show the time so the result of all the complicated human activities of russians and french all their passions desires remorse humiliations sufferings outbursts of pride fear and enthusiasm was only the loss of the battle of austerlitz the so-called battle of the three emperors that is to say a slow movement of the hand on the dial of human history prince andrew was on duty that day and in constant attendance on the commander in chief at six in the evening kutzov went to the emperors headquarters and after staying but a short time with the tsar went to see the grand marshal of the court count tolsty bolknski took the opportunity to go in to get some details of the coming action from dolgorkov he felt that kutzov was upset and dissatisfied about something and that at headquarters they were dissatisfied with him and also that at the emperors headquarters everyone adopted toward him the tone of men who know something others do not know he therefore wished to speak to dolgorkov well how dyou do my dear fellow said dolgorkov who was sitting at tea with bilbin the fete is for tomorrow how is your old fellow out of sorts i wont say he is out of sorts but i fancy he would like to be heard but they heard him at the council
