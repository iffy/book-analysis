god gave her the answer in her own heart desire nothing for thyself seek nothing be not anxious or envious mans future and thy own fate must remain hidden from thee but live so that thou mayest be ready for anything if it be gods will to prove thee in the duties of marriage be ready to fulfill his will with this consoling thought but yet with a hope for the fulfillment of her forbidden earthly longing princess mary sighed and having crossed herself went down thinking neither of her gown and coiffure nor of how she would go in nor of what she would say what could all that matter in comparison with the will of god without whose care not a hair of mans head can fall chapter iv when princess mary came down prince vasli and his son were already in the drawing room talking to the little princess and mademoiselle bourienne when she entered with her heavy step treading on her heels the gentlemen and mademoiselle bourienne rose and the little princess indicating her to the gentlemen said voil marie princess mary saw them all and saw them in detail she saw prince vaslis face serious for an instant at the sight of her but immediately smiling again and the little princess curiously noting the impression marie produced on the visitors and she saw mademoiselle bourienne with her ribbon and pretty face and her unusually animated look which was fixed on him but him she could not see she only saw something large brilliant and handsome moving toward her as she entered the room prince vasli approached first and she kissed the bold forehead that bent over her hand and answered his question by saying that on the contrary she remembered him quite well then anatole came up to her she still could not see him she only felt a soft hand taking hers firmly and she touched with her lips a white forehead over which was beautiful light-brown hair smelling of pomade when she looked up at him she was struck by his beauty anatole stood with his right thumb under a button of his uniform his chest expanded and his back drawn in slightly swinging one foot and with his head a little bent looked with beaming face at the princess without speaking and evidently not thinking about her at all anatole was not quick-witted nor ready or eloquent in conversation but he had the faculty so invaluable in society of composure and imperturbable self-possession if a man lacking in self-confidence remains dumb on a first introduction and betrays a consciousness of the impropriety of such silence and an anxiety to find something to say the effect is bad but anatole was dumb swung his foot and smilingly examined the princess hair it was evident that he could be silent in this way for a very long time if anyone finds this silence inconvenient let him talk but i dont want to he seemed to say besides this in his behavior to women anatole had a manner which particularly inspires in them curiosity awe and even love a supercilious consciousness of his own superiority it was as if he said to them i know you i know you but why should i bother about you youd be only too glad of course perhaps he did not really think this when he met women even probably he did not for in general he thought very little but his looks and manner gave that impression the princess felt this and as if wishing to show him that she did not even dare expect to interest him she turned to his father the conversation was general and animated thanks to princess lises voice and little downy lip that lifted over her white teeth she met prince vasli with that playful manner often employed by lively chatty people and consisting in the assumption that between the person they so address and themselves there are some semi-private long-established jokes and amusing reminiscences though no such reminiscences really exist just as none existed in this case prince vasli readily adopted her tone and the little princess also drew anatole whom she hardly knew into these amusing recollections of things that had never occurred mademoiselle bourienne also shared them and even princess mary felt herself pleasantly made to share in these merry reminiscences here at least we shall have the benefit of your company all to ourselves dear prince said the little princess of course in french to prince vasli its not as
