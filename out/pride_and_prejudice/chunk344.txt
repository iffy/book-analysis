mr darcy he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam but so we all do it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor i speak feelingly a younger son you know must be inured to self-denial and dependence in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of either now seriously what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature but in matters of greater weight i may suffer from want of money younger sons cannot marry where they like unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do our habits of expense make us too dependent
