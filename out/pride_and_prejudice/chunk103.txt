always under good regulation elizabeth turned away to hide a smile your examination of mr darcy is over i presume said miss bingley and pray what is the result i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect he owns it himself without disguise no said darcy i have made no such pretension i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding my temper i dare not vouch for it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought nor their offenses against myself my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them my temper would perhaps be called resentful my good opinion once lost is lost forever that is a failing indeed cried elizabeth implacable resentment is a shade in a character but you have chosen your fault well i really cannot laugh at it
