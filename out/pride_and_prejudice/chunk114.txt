the day i remain dear sir with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters your well-wisher and friend william collins at four oclock therefore we may expect this peace-making gentleman said mr bennet as he folded up the letter he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person to discourage him though it is difficult said jane to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his credit elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for lady catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and burying his parishioners whenever it were required
