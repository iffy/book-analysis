this great lady was not in the commission of the peace of the county she was a most active magistrate in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr collins and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome discontented or too poor she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences silence their complaints and scold them into harmony and plenty the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week and allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only one card-table in the evening every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first their other engagements were few as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond mr collinss reach this however was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year
