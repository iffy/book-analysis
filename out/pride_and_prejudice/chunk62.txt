not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition certainly not to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is above her ankles in dirt and alone quite alone what could she mean by it it seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence a most country-town indifference to decorum it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said bingley i am afraid mr darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercise a short pause followed this speech and mrs hurst began again i have an excessive regard for miss jane bennet she is really a very sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of it
