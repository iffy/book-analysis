speak of it again to anybody i told my sister phillips so the other day but i cannot find out that jane saw anything of him in london well he is a very undeserving young man and i do not suppose theres the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have enquired of everybody too who is likely to know i do not believe he will ever live at netherfield any more oh well it is just as he chooses nobody wants him to come though i shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill and if i was her i would not have put up with it well my comfort is i am sure jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he has done but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she
