sentiments which mr wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character it adds even another motive my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to mr wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events mr wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited he had some intention he added of studying law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal i knew that mr wickham ought not to be a clergyman the business was therefore soon settled he resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds all connection between us seemed now dissolved i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town in town
