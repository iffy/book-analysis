of the suddenness of your alarm--of the shock you will not be hysterical again i dare say we shall have nothing to distress us i perfectly understand mr robinsons directions and have no fears and indeed mary i cannot wonder at your husband nursing does not belong to a man it is not his province a sick child is always the mothers property her own feelings generally make it so i hope i am as fond of my child as any mother but i do not know that i am of any more use in the sick-room than charles for i cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill and you saw this morning that if i told him to keep quiet he was sure to begin kicking about i have not nerves for the sort of thing but could you be comfortable yourself to be spending the whole evening away from the poor boy yes you see his papa can and why should not i jemima is so careful and she could send us word every hour how he was i really think charles might as well have told his father we would all come i am not more alarmed about little charles now than he is i was dreadfully alarmed yesterday but the case is very different to-day well if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself suppose you were to go as well as your husband leave little charles to my care mr and mrs musgrove cannot think it wrong while i remain with him are you serious cried mary her eyes brightening dear
