objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especially a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for her elizabeth felt herself completely taken in she had fully proposed being engaged by mr wickham for those very dances and to have mr collins instead her liveliness had never been worse timed there was no help for it however mr wickhams happiness and her own were perforce delayed a little longer and mr collinss proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could she was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more it now first struck her that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible visitors the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to her elizabeth however did not choose to take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply mr collins might never make the offer and till he did it
