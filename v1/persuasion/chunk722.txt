in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you do now to me she was in the place of a parent do not mistake me however i am not saying that she did not err in her advice it was perhaps one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides and for myself i certainly never should in any circumstance of tolerable similarity give such advice but i mean that i was right in submitting to her and that if i had done otherwise i should have suffered more in continuing the engagement than i did even in giving it up
