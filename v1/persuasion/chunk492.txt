well this miss louisa we all thought you know was to marry frederick he was courting her week after week the only wonder was what they could be waiting for till the business at lyme came then indeed it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain was set to right but even then there was something odd in their way of going on instead of staying at lyme he went off to plymouth and then he went off to see edward when we came back from minehead he was gone down to edward's and there he has been ever since we have seen nothing of him since november even
