and destroy their army it is quite clear that the battle of tartino just because of its incongruities was exactly what was wanted at that stage of the campaign it would be difficult and even impossible to imagine any result more opportune than the actual outcome of this battle with a minimum of effort and insignificant losses despite the greatest confusion the most important results of the whole campaign were attained the transition from retreat to advance an exposure of the weakness of the french and the administration of that shock which napoleons army had only awaited to begin its flight chapter viii napoleon enters moscow after the brilliant victory de la moskowa there can be no doubt about the victory for the battlefield remains in the hands of the french the russians retreat and abandon their ancient capital moscow abounding in provisions arms munitions and incalculable wealth is in napoleons hands the russian army only half the strength of the french does not make a single attempt to attack for a whole month napoleons position is most brilliant he can either fall on the russian army with double its strength and destroy it negotiate an advantageous peace or in case of a refusal make a menacing move on petersburg or even in the case of a reverse return to smolnsk or vlna or remain in moscow in short no special genius would seem to be required to retain the brilliant position the french held at that time for that only very simple and easy steps were necessary not to allow the troops to loot to prepare winter clothing of which there was sufficient in moscow for the whole army and methodically to collect the provisions of which according to the french historians there were enough in moscow to supply the whole army for six months yet napoleon that greatest of all geniuses who the historians declare had control of the army took none of these steps he not merely did nothing of the kind but on the contrary he used his power to select the most foolish and ruinous of all the courses open to him of all that napoleon might have done wintering in moscow advancing on petersburg or on nzhni-nvgorod or retiring by a more northerly or more southerly route say by the road kutzov afterwards took nothing more stupid or disastrous can be imagined than what he actually did he remained in moscow till october letting the troops plunder the city then hesitating whether to leave a garrison behind him he quitted moscow approached kutzov without joining battle turned to the right and reached mlo-yaroslvets again without attempting to break through and take the road kutzov took but retiring instead to mozhysk along the devastated smolnsk road nothing more stupid than that could have been devised or more disastrous for the army as the sequel showed had napoleons aim been to destroy his army the most skillful strategist could hardly have devised any series of actions that would so completely have accomplished that purpose independently of anything the russian army might do napoleon the man of genius did this but to say that he destroyed his army because he wished to or because he was very stupid would be as unjust as to say that he had brought his troops to moscow because he wished to and because he was very clever and a genius in both cases his personal activity having no more force than the personal activity of any soldier merely coincided with the laws that guided the event the historians quite falsely represent napoleons faculties as having weakened in moscow and do so only because the results did not justify his actions he employed all his ability and strength to do the best he could for himself and his army as he had done previously and as he did subsequently in his activity at that time was no less astounding than it was in egypt in italy in austria and in prussia we do not know for certain in how far his genius was genuine in egypt where forty centuries looked down upon his grandeur for his great exploits there are all told us by frenchmen we cannot accurately estimate his genius in austria or prussia for we have to draw our information from french or german sources and the incomprehensible surrender of whole corps without fighting and of fortresses without a siege must incline germans to recognize his genius as the only explanation of the war carried on in germany but we thank god
