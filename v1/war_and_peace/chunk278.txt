addressing himself to spernski was relating an anecdote and spernski was laughing in advance at what magntski was going to say when prince andrew entered the room magntskis words were again crowned by laughter stolpin gave a deep bass guffaw as he munched a piece of bread and cheese gervais laughed softly with a hissing chuckle and spernski in a high-pitched staccato manner still laughing spernski held out his soft white hand to prince andrew very pleased to see you prince he said one moment he went on turning to magntski and interrupting his story we have agreed that this is a dinner for recreation with not a word about business and turning again to the narrator he began to laugh afresh prince andrew looked at the laughing spernski with astonishment regret and disillusionment it seemed to him that this was not spernski but someone else everything that had formerly appeared mysterious and fascinating in spernski suddenly became plain and unattractive at dinner the conversation did not cease for a moment and seemed to consist of the contents of a book of funny anecdotes before magntski had finished his story someone else was anxious to relate something still funnier most of the anecdotes if not relating to the state service related to people in the service it seemed that in this company the insignificance of those people was so definitely accepted that the only possible attitude toward them was one of good humored ridicule spernski related how at the council that morning a deaf dignitary when asked his opinion replied that he thought so too gervais gave a long account of an official revision remarkable for the stupidity of everybody concerned stolpin stuttering broke into the conversation and began excitedly talking of the abuses that existed under the former order of things threatening to give a serious turn to the conversation magntski starting quizzing stolpin about his vehemence gervais intervened with a joke and the talk reverted to its former lively tone evidently spernski liked to rest after his labors and find amusement in a circle of friends and his guests understanding his wish tried to enliven him and amuse themselves but their gaiety seemed to prince andrew mirthless and tiresome spernskis high-pitched voice struck him unpleasantly and the incessant laughter grated on him like a false note prince andrew did not laugh and feared that he would be a damper on the spirits of the company but no one took any notice of his being out of harmony with the general mood they all seemed very gay he tried several times to join in the conversation but his remarks were tossed aside each time like a cork thrown out of the water and he could not jest with them there was nothing wrong or unseemly in what they said it was witty and might have been funny but it lacked just that something which is the salt of mirth and they were not even aware that such a thing existed after dinner spernskis daughter and her governess rose he patted the little girl with his white hand and kissed her and that gesture too seemed unnatural to prince andrew the men remained at table over their port english fashion in the midst of a conversation that was started about napoleons spanish affairs which they all agreed in approving prince andrew began to express a contrary opinion spernski smiled and with an evident wish to prevent the conversation from taking an unpleasant course told a story that had no connection with the previous conversation for a few moments all were silent having sat some time at table spernski corked a bottle of wine and remarking nowadays good wine rides in a carriage and pair passed it to the servant and got up all rose and continuing to talk loudly went into the drawing room two letters brought by a courier were handed to spernski and he took them to his study as soon as he had left the room the general merriment stopped and the guests began to converse sensibly and quietly with one another now for the recitation said spernski on returning from his study a wonderful talent he said to prince andrew and magntski immediately assumed a pose and began reciting some humorous verses in french which he had composed about various well-known petersburg people he was interrupted several times by applause when the verses were finished prince andrew went up to spernski and took his leave where are you off to so early asked spernski i promised to go
