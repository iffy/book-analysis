a few words about the reception arakchev had given bolknski spernski smiled more markedly the chairman of the committee on army regulations is my good friend monsieur magntski he said fully articulating every word and syllable and if you like i can put you in touch with him he paused at the full stop i hope you will find him sympathetic and ready to co-operate in promoting all that is reasonable a circle soon formed round spernski and the old man who had talked about his subordinate prynichnikov addressed a question to him prince andrew without joining in the conversation watched every movement of spernskis this man not long since an insignificant divinity student who now bolknski thought held in his hands those plump white hands the fate of russia prince andrew was struck by the extraordinarily disdainful composure with which spernski answered the old man he appeared to address condescending words to him from an immeasurable height when the old man began to speak too loud spernski smiled and said he could not judge of the advantage or disadvantage of what pleased the sovereign having talked for a little while in the general circle spernski rose and coming up to prince andrew took him along to the other end of the room it was clear that he thought it necessary to interest himself in bolknski i had no chance to talk with you prince during the animated conversation in which that venerable gentleman involved me he said with a mildly contemptuous smile as if intimating by that smile that he and prince andrew understood the insignificance of the people with whom he had just been talking this flattered prince andrew i have known of you for a long time first from your action with regard to your serfs a first example of which it is very desirable that there should be more imitators and secondly because you are one of those gentlemen of the chamber who have not considered themselves offended by the new decree concerning the ranks allotted to courtiers which is causing so much gossip and tittle-tattle no said prince andrew my father did not wish me to take advantage of the privilege i began the service from the lower grade your father a man of the last century evidently stands above our contemporaries who so condemn this measure which merely re-establishes natural justice i think however that these condemnations have some ground returned prince andrew trying to resist spernskis influence of which he began to be conscious he did not like to agree with him in everything and felt a wish to contradict though he usually spoke easily and well he felt a difficulty in expressing himself now while talking with spernski he was too much absorbed in observing the famous mans personality grounds of personal ambition maybe spernski put in quietly and of state interest to some extent said prince andrew what do you mean asked spernski quietly lowering his eyes i am an admirer of montesquieu replied prince andrew and his idea that le principe des monarchies est lhonneur me parat incontestable certains droits et privilges de la noblesse me paraissent tre des moyens de soutenir ce sentiment the principle of monarchies is honor seems to me incontestable certain rights and privileges for the aristocracy appear to me a means of maintaining that sentiment the smile vanished from spernskis white face which was much improved by the change probably prince andrews thought interested him si vous envisagez la question sous ce point de vue he began pronouncing french with evident difficulty and speaking even slower than in russian but quite calmly if you regard the question from that point of view spernski went on to say that honor lhonneur cannot be upheld by privileges harmful to the service that honor lhonneur is either a negative concept of not doing what is blameworthy or it is a source of emulation in pursuit of commendation and rewards which recognize it his arguments were concise simple and clear an institution upholding honor the source of emulation is one similar to the lgion dhonneur of the great emperor napoleon not harmful but helpful to the success of the service but not a class or court privilege i do not dispute that but it cannot be denied that court privileges have attained the same end returned prince andrew every courtier considers himself bound to maintain his position worthily yet you do not care to avail yourself of the privilege prince said spernski indicating by a smile that he wished to finish
