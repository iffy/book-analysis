been convinced that it was impossible for him to make a mistake and that in his perception whatever he did was right not because it harmonized with any idea of right and wrong but because he did it the emperor was in very good spirits after his ride through vlna where crowds of people had rapturously greeted and followed him from all the windows of the streets through which he rode rugs flags and his monogram were displayed and the polish ladies welcoming him waved their handkerchiefs to him at dinner having placed balashv beside him napoleon not only treated him amiably but behaved as if balashv were one of his own courtiers one of those who sympathized with his plans and ought to rejoice at his success in the course of conversation he mentioned moscow and questioned balashv about the russian capital not merely as an interested traveler asks about a new city he intends to visit but as if convinced that balashv as a russian must be flattered by his curiosity how many inhabitants are there in moscow how many houses is it true that moscow is called holy moscow how many churches are there in moscow he asked and receiving the reply that there were more than two hundred churches he remarked why such a quantity of churches the russians are very devout replied balashv but a large number of monasteries and churches is always a sign of the backwardness of a people said napoleon turning to caulaincourt for appreciation of this remark balashv respectfully ventured to disagree with the french emperor every country has its own character said he but nowhere in europe is there anything like that said napoleon i beg your majestys pardon returned balashv besides russia there is spain where there are also many churches and monasteries this reply of balashvs which hinted at the recent defeats of the french in spain was much appreciated when he related it at alexanders court but it was not much appreciated at napoleons dinner where it passed unnoticed the uninterested and perplexed faces of the marshals showed that they were puzzled as to what balashvs tone suggested if there is a point we dont see it or it is not at all witty their expressions seemed to say so little was his rejoinder appreciated that napoleon did not notice it at all and navely asked balashv through what towns the direct road from there to moscow passed balashv who was on the alert all through the dinner replied that just as all roads lead to rome so all roads lead to moscow there were many roads and among them the road through poltva which charles xii chose balashv involuntarily flushed with pleasure at the aptitude of this reply but hardly had he uttered the word poltva before caulaincourt began speaking of the badness of the road from petersburg to moscow and of his petersburg reminiscences after dinner they went to drink coffee in napoleons study which four days previously had been that of the emperor alexander napoleon sat down toying with his svres coffee cup and motioned balashv to a chair beside him napoleon was in that well-known after-dinner mood which more than any reasoned cause makes a man contented with himself and disposed to consider everyone his friend it seemed to him that he was surrounded by men who adored him and he felt convinced that after his dinner balashv too was his friend and worshiper napoleon turned to him with a pleasant though slightly ironic smile they tell me this is the room the emperor alexander occupied strange isnt it general he said evidently not doubting that this remark would be agreeable to his hearer since it went to prove his napoleons superiority to alexander balashv made no reply and bowed his head in silence yes four days ago in this room wintzingerode and stein were deliberating continued napoleon with the same derisive and self-confident smile what i cant understand he went on is that the emperor alexander has surrounded himself with my personal enemies that i do not understand has he not thought that i may do the same and he turned inquiringly to balashv and evidently this thought turned him back on to the track of his mornings anger which was still fresh in him and let him know that i will do so said napoleon rising and pushing his cup away with his hand ill drive all his wrttemberg baden and weimar relations out of germany yes ill drive them out let him
