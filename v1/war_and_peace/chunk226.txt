measures had been taken for the sale of the land and forests and to release them from the land bank but would probably never even inquire and would never know that the newly erected buildings were standing empty and that the serfs continued to give in money and work all that other peoples serfs gave that is to say all that could be got out of them chapter xi returning from his journey through south russia in the happiest state of mind pierre carried out an intention he had long had of visiting his friend bolknski whom he had not seen for two years boguchrovo lay in a flat uninteresting part of the country among fields and forests of fir and birch which were partly cut down the house lay behind a newly dug pond filled with water to the brink and with banks still bare of grass it was at the end of a village that stretched along the highroad in the midst of a young copse in which were a few fir trees the homestead consisted of a threshing floor outhouses stables a bathhouse a lodge and a large brick house with semicircular faade still in course of construction round the house was a garden newly laid out the fences and gates were new and solid two fire pumps and a water cart painted green stood in a shed the paths were straight the bridges were strong and had handrails everything bore an impress of tidiness and good management some domestic serfs pierre met in reply to inquiries as to where the prince lived pointed out a small newly built lodge close to the pond antn a man who had looked after prince andrew in his boyhood helped pierre out of his carriage said that the prince was at home and showed him into a clean little anteroom pierre was struck by the modesty of the small though clean house after the brilliant surroundings in which he had last met his friend in petersburg he quickly entered the small reception room with its still-unplastered wooden walls redolent of pine and would have gone farther but antn ran ahead on tiptoe and knocked at a door well what is it came a sharp unpleasant voice a visitor answered antn ask him to wait and the sound was heard of a chair being pushed back pierre went with rapid steps to the door and suddenly came face to face with prince andrew who came out frowning and looking old pierre embraced him and lifting his spectacles kissed his friend on the cheek and looked at him closely well i did not expect you i am very glad said prince andrew pierre said nothing he looked fixedly at his friend with surprise he was struck by the change in him his words were kindly and there was a smile on his lips and face but his eyes were dull and lifeless and in spite of his evident wish to do so he could not give them a joyous and glad sparkle prince andrew had grown thinner paler and more manly-looking but what amazed and estranged pierre till he got used to it were his inertia and a wrinkle on his brow indicating prolonged concentration on some one thought as is usually the case with people meeting after a prolonged separation it was long before their conversation could settle on anything they put questions and gave brief replies about things they knew ought to be talked over at length at last the conversation gradually settled on some of the topics at first lightly touched on their past life plans for the future pierres journeys and occupations the war and so on the preoccupation and despondency which pierre had noticed in his friends look was now still more clearly expressed in the smile with which he listened to pierre especially when he spoke with joyful animation of the past or the future it was as if prince andrew would have liked to sympathize with what pierre was saying but could not the latter began to feel that it was in bad taste to speak of his enthusiasms dreams and hopes of happiness or goodness in prince andrews presence he was ashamed to express his new masonic views which had been particularly revived and strengthened by his late tour he checked himself fearing to seem nave yet he felt an irresistible desire to show his friend as soon as possible that he was now a quite different and better pierre than he had been in petersburg
