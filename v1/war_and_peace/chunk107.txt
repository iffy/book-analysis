him he was seized by panic and could not go where it was dangerous having reached the left flank instead of going to the front where the firing was he began to look for the general and his staff where they could not possibly be and so did not deliver the order the command of the left flank belonged by seniority to the commander of the regiment kutzov had reviewed at braunau and in which dlokhov was serving as a private but the command of the extreme left flank had been assigned to the commander of the pvlograd regiment in which rostv was serving and a misunderstanding arose the two commanders were much exasperated with one another and long after the action had begun on the right flank and the french were already advancing were engaged in discussion with the sole object of offending one another but the regiments both cavalry and infantry were by no means ready for the impending action from privates to general they were not expecting a battle and were engaged in peaceful occupations the cavalry feeding the horses and the infantry collecting wood he higher iss dan i in rank said the german colonel of the hussars flushing and addressing an adjutant who had ridden up so let him do what he vill but i cannot sacrifice my hussars bugler sount ze retreat but haste was becoming imperative cannon and musketry mingling together thundered on the right and in the center while the capotes of lannes sharpshooters were already seen crossing the milldam and forming up within twice the range of a musket shot the general in command of the infantry went toward his horse with jerky steps and having mounted drew himself up very straight and tall and rode to the pvlograd commander the commanders met with polite bows but with secret malevolence in their hearts once again colonel said the general i cant leave half my men in the wood i beg of you i beg of you he repeated to occupy the position and prepare for an attack i peg of you yourself not to mix in vot is not your business suddenly replied the irate colonel if you vere in the cavalry i am not in the cavalry colonel but i am a russian general and if you are not aware of the fact quite avare your excellency suddenly shouted the colonel touching his horse and turning purple in the face vill you be so goot to come to ze front and see dat zis position iss no goot i dont vish to destroy my men for your pleasure you forget yourself colonel i am not considering my own pleasure and i wont allow it to be said taking the colonels outburst as a challenge to his courage the general expanded his chest and rode frowning beside him to the front line as if their differences would be settled there amongst the bullets they reached the front several bullets sped over them and they halted in silence there was nothing fresh to be seen from the line for from where they had been before it had been evident that it was impossible for cavalry to act among the bushes and broken ground as well as that the french were outflanking our left the general and colonel looked sternly and significantly at one another like two fighting cocks preparing for battle each vainly trying to detect signs of cowardice in the other both passed the examination successfully as there was nothing to be said and neither wished to give occasion for it to be alleged that he had been the first to leave the range of fire they would have remained there for a long time testing each others courage had it not been that just then they heard the rattle of musketry and a muffled shout almost behind them in the wood the french had attacked the men collecting wood in the copse it was no longer possible for the hussars to retreat with the infantry they were cut off from the line of retreat on the left by the french however inconvenient the position it was now necessary to attack in order to cut a way through for themselves the squadron in which rostv was serving had scarcely time to mount before it was halted facing the enemy again as at the enns bridge there was nothing between the squadron and the enemy and again that terrible dividing line of uncertainty and fear resembling the line separating the living from the dead
