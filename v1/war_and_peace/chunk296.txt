you got excited mtenka has told me all about it i knew thought nicholas that i should never understand anything in this crazy world you were angry that he had not entered those rubles but they were carried forward and you did not look at the other page papa he is a blackguard and a thief i know he is and what i have done i have done but if you like i wont speak to him again no my dear boy the count too felt embarrassed he knew he had mismanaged his wifes property and was to blame toward his children but he did not know how to remedy it no i beg you to attend to the business i am old i no papa forgive me if i have caused you unpleasantness i understand it all less than you do devil take all these peasants and money matters and carryings forward from page to page he thought i used to understand what a corner and the stakes at cards meant but carrying forward to another page i dont understand at all said he to himself and after that he did not meddle in business affairs but once the countess called her son and informed him that she had a promissory note from anna mikhylovna for two thousand rubles and asked him what he thought of doing with it this answered nicholas you say it rests with me well i dont like anna mikhylovna and i dont like bors but they were our friends and poor well then this and he tore up the note and by so doing caused the old countess to weep tears of joy after that young rostv took no further part in any business affairs but devoted himself with passionate enthusiasm to what was to him a new pursuit the chase for which his father kept a large establishment chapter iii the weather was already growing wintry and morning frosts congealed an earth saturated by autumn rains the verdure had thickened and its bright green stood out sharply against the brownish strips of winter rye trodden down by the cattle and against the pale-yellow stubble of the spring buckwheat the wooded ravines and the copses which at the end of august had still been green islands amid black fields and stubble had become golden and bright-red islands amid the green winter rye the hares had already half changed their summer coats the fox cubs were beginning to scatter and the young wolves were bigger than dogs it was the best time of the year for the chase the hounds of that ardent young sportsman rostv had not merely reached hard winter condition but were so jaded that at a meeting of the huntsmen it was decided to give them a three days rest and then on the sixteenth of september to go on a distant expedition starting from the oak grove where there was an undisturbed litter of wolf cubs all that day the hounds remained at home it was frosty and the air was sharp but toward evening the sky became overcast and it began to thaw on the fifteenth when young rostv in his dressing gown looked out of the window he saw it was an unsurpassable morning for hunting it was as if the sky were melting and sinking to the earth without any wind the only motion in the air was that of the dripping microscopic particles of drizzling mist the bare twigs in the garden were hung with transparent drops which fell on the freshly fallen leaves the earth in the kitchen garden looked wet and black and glistened like poppy seed and at a short distance merged into the dull moist veil of mist nicholas went out into the wet and muddy porch there was a smell of decaying leaves and of dog mlka a black-spotted broad-haunched bitch with prominent black eyes got up on seeing her master stretched her hind legs lay down like a hare and then suddenly jumped up and licked him right on his nose and mustache another borzoi a dog catching sight of his master from the garden path arched his back and rushing headlong toward the porch with lifted tail began rubbing himself against his legs o-hoy came at that moment that inimitable huntsmans call which unites the deepest bass with the shrillest tenor and round the corner came daniel the head huntsman and head kennelman a gray wrinkled old man with hair cut straight over his forehead ukrainian fashion a long bent whip
