whom one cant get any sensible account of what has happened because they all want to show how well they can fight but thats not what is needed now and what ingenious maneuvers they all propose to me it seems to them that when they have thought of two or three contingencies he remembered the general plan sent him from petersburg they have foreseen everything but the contingencies are endless the undecided question as to whether the wound inflicted at borodin was mortal or not had hung over kutzovs head for a whole month on the one hand the french had occupied moscow on the other kutzov felt assured with all his being that the terrible blow into which he and all the russians had put their whole strength must have been mortal but in any case proofs were needed he had waited a whole month for them and grew more impatient the longer he waited lying on his bed during those sleepless nights he did just what he reproached those younger generals for doing he imagined all sorts of possible contingencies just like the younger men but with this difference that he saw thousands of contingencies instead of two or three and based nothing on them the longer he thought the more contingencies presented themselves he imagined all sorts of movements of the napoleonic army as a whole or in sections against petersburg or against him or to outflank him he thought too of the possibility which he feared most of all that napoleon might fight him with his own weapon and remain in moscow awaiting him kutzov even imagined that napoleons army might turn back through medn and yukhnv but the one thing he could not foresee was what happened the insane convulsive stampede of napoleons army during its first eleven days after leaving moscow a stampede which made possible what kutzov had not yet even dared to think of the complete extermination of the french drokhovs report about broussiers division the guerrillas reports of distress in napoleons army rumors of preparations for leaving moscow all confirmed the supposition that the french army was beaten and preparing for flight but these were only suppositions which seemed important to the younger men but not to kutzov with his sixty years experience he knew what value to attach to rumors knew how apt people who desire anything are to group all news so that it appears to confirm what they desire and he knew how readily in such cases they omit all that makes for the contrary and the more he desired it the less he allowed himself to believe it this question absorbed all his mental powers all else was to him only lifes customary routine to such customary routine belonged his conversations with the staff the letters he wrote from tartino to madame de stal the reading of novels the distribution of awards his correspondence with petersburg and so on but the destruction of the french which he alone foresaw was his hearts one desire on the night of the eleventh of october he lay leaning on his arm and thinking of that there was a stir in the next room and he heard the steps of toll konovntsyn and bolkhovtinov eh whos there come in come in what news the field marshal called out to them while a footman was lighting a candle toll communicated the substance of the news who brought it asked kutzov with a look which when the candle was lit struck toll by its cold severity there can be no doubt about it your highness call him in call him here kutzov sat up with one leg hanging down from the bed and his big paunch resting against the other which was doubled under him he screwed up his seeing eye to scrutinize the messenger more carefully as if wishing to read in his face what preoccupied his own mind tell me tell me friend said he to bolkhovtinov in his low aged voice as he pulled together the shirt which gaped open on his chest come nearer nearer what news have you brought me eh that napoleon has left moscow are you sure eh bolkhovtinov gave a detailed account from the beginning of all he had been told to report speak quicker quicker dont torture me kutzov interrupted him bolkhovtinov told him everything and was then silent awaiting instructions toll was beginning to say something but kutzov checked him he tried to say something but his face suddenly puckered and wrinkled he waved his
