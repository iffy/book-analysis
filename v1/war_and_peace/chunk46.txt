its gray mane which though he saw other faces as well he had not lost sight of for a single moment during the whole service he judged by the cautious movements of those who crowded round the invalid chair that they had lifted the dying man and were moving him catch hold of my arm or youll drop him he heard one of the servants say in a frightened whisper catch hold from underneath here exclaimed different voices and the heavy breathing of the bearers and the shuffling of their feet grew more hurried as if the weight they were carrying were too much for them as the bearers among whom was anna mikhylovna passed the young man he caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the dying mans high stout uncovered chest and powerful shoulders raised by those who were holding him under the armpits and of his gray curly leonine head this head with its remarkably broad brow and cheekbones its handsome sensual mouth and its cold majestic expression was not disfigured by the approach of death it was the same as pierre remembered it three months before when the count had sent him to petersburg but now this head was swaying helplessly with the uneven movements of the bearers and the cold listless gaze fixed itself upon nothing after a few minutes bustle beside the high bedstead those who had carried the sick man dispersed anna mikhylovna touched pierres hand and said come pierre went with her to the bed on which the sick man had been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony just completed he lay with his head propped high on the pillows his hands were symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt the palms downward when pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him but with a look the significance of which could not be understood by mortal man either this look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes they must look somewhere or it meant too much pierre hesitated not knowing what to do and glanced inquiringly at his guide anna mikhylovna made a hurried sign with her eyes glancing at the sick mans hand and moving her lips as if to send it a kiss pierre carefully stretching his neck so as not to touch the quilt followed her suggestion and pressed his lips to the large boned fleshy hand neither the hand nor a single muscle of the counts face stirred once more pierre looked questioningly at anna mikhylovna to see what he was to do next anna mikhylovna with her eyes indicated a chair that stood beside the bed pierre obediently sat down his eyes asking if he were doing right anna mikhylovna nodded approvingly again pierre fell into the navely symmetrical pose of an egyptian statue evidently distressed that his stout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing his utmost to look as small as possible he looked at the count who still gazed at the spot where pierres face had been before he sat down anna mikhylovna indicated by her attitude her consciousness of the pathetic importance of these last moments of meeting between the father and son this lasted about two minutes which to pierre seemed an hour suddenly the broad muscles and lines of the counts face began to twitch the twitching increased the handsome mouth was drawn to one side only now did pierre realize how near death his father was and from that distorted mouth issued an indistinct hoarse sound anna mikhylovna looked attentively at the sick mans eyes trying to guess what he wanted she pointed first to pierre then to some drink then named prince vasli in an inquiring whisper then pointed to the quilt the eyes and face of the sick man showed impatience he made an effort to look at the servant who stood constantly at the head of the bed wants to turn on the other side whispered the servant and got up to turn the counts heavy body toward the wall pierre rose to help him while the count was being turned over one of his arms fell back helplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward whether he noticed the look of terror with which pierre regarded that lifeless arm or whether some other thought flitted across his dying brain at any rate he glanced at the refractory arm at pierres terror-stricken face and again at the arm and on his face
