his fellow officers prince andrew was galloping along in a post chaise enjoying the feelings of a man who has at length begun to attain a long-desired happiness as soon as he closed his eyes his ears seemed filled with the rattle of the wheels and the sensation of victory then he began to imagine that the russians were running away and that he himself was killed but he quickly roused himself with a feeling of joy as if learning afresh that this was not so but that on the contrary the french had run away he again recalled all the details of the victory and his own calm courage during the battle and feeling reassured he dozed off the dark starry night was followed by a bright cheerful morning the snow was thawing in the sunshine the horses galloped quickly and on both sides of the road were forests of different kinds fields and villages at one of the post stations he overtook a convoy of russian wounded the russian officer in charge of the transport lolled back in the front cart shouting and scolding a soldier with coarse abuse in each of the long german carts six or more pale dirty bandaged men were being jolted over the stony road some of them were talking he heard russian words others were eating bread the more severely wounded looked silently with the languid interest of sick children at the envoy hurrying past them prince andrew told his driver to stop and asked a soldier in what action they had been wounded day before yesterday on the danube answered the soldier prince andrew took out his purse and gave the soldier three gold pieces thats for them all he said to the officer who came up get well soon lads he continued turning to the soldiers theres plenty to do still what news sir asked the officer evidently anxious to start a conversation good news go on he shouted to the driver and they galloped on it was already quite dark when prince andrew rattled over the paved streets of brnn and found himself surrounded by high buildings the lights of shops houses and street lamps fine carriages and all that atmosphere of a large and active town which is always so attractive to a soldier after camp life despite his rapid journey and sleepless night prince andrew when he drove up to the palace felt even more vigorous and alert than he had done the day before only his eyes gleamed feverishly and his thoughts followed one another with extraordinary clearness and rapidity he again vividly recalled the details of the battle no longer dim but definite and in the concise form in which he imagined himself stating them to the emperor francis he vividly imagined the casual questions that might be put to him and the answers he would give he expected to be at once presented to the emperor at the chief entrance to the palace however an official came running out to meet him and learning that he was a special messenger led him to another entrance to the right from the corridor euer hochgeboren there you will find the adjutant on duty said the official he will conduct you to the minister of war the adjutant on duty meeting prince andrew asked him to wait and went in to the minister of war five minutes later he returned and bowing with particular courtesy ushered prince andrew before him along a corridor to the cabinet where the minister of war was at work the adjutant by his elaborate courtesy appeared to wish to ward off any attempt at familiarity on the part of the russian messenger prince andrews joyous feeling was considerably weakened as he approached the door of the ministers room he felt offended and without his noticing it the feeling of offense immediately turned into one of disdain which was quite uncalled for his fertile mind instantly suggested to him a point of view which gave him a right to despise the adjutant and the minister away from the smell of powder they probably think it easy to gain victories he thought his eyes narrowed disdainfully he entered the room of the minister of war with peculiarly deliberate steps this feeling of disdain was heightened when he saw the minister seated at a large table reading some papers and making pencil notes on them and for the first two or three minutes taking no notice of his arrival a wax candle stood at each side of
