her mother and again in a futile struggle with reality her mother refusing to believe that she could live when her beloved boy was killed in the bloom of life escaped from reality into a world of delirium natsha did not remember how that day passed nor that night nor the next day and night she did not sleep and did not leave her mother her persevering and patient love seemed completely to surround the countess every moment not explaining or consoling but recalling her to life during the third night the countess kept very quiet for a few minutes and natsha rested her head on the arm of her chair and closed her eyes but opened them again on hearing the bedstead creak the countess was sitting up in bed and speaking softly how glad i am you have come you are tired wont you have some tea natsha went up to her you have improved in looks and grown more manly continued the countess taking her daughters hand mamma what are you saying natsha he is no more no more and embracing her daughter the countess began to weep for the first time chapter iii princess mary postponed her departure snya and the count tried to replace natsha but could not they saw that she alone was able to restrain her mother from unreasoning despair for three weeks natsha remained constantly at her mothers side sleeping on a lounge chair in her room making her eat and drink and talking to her incessantly because the mere sound of her tender caressing tones soothed her mother the mothers wounded spirit could not heal ptyas death had torn from her half her life when the news of ptyas death had come she had been a fresh and vigorous woman of fifty but a month later she left her room a listless old woman taking no interest in life but the same blow that almost killed the countess this second blow restored natsha to life a spiritual wound produced by a rending of the spiritual body is like a physical wound and strange as it may seem just as a deep wound may heal and its edges join physical and spiritual wounds alike can yet heal completely only as the result of a vital force from within natshas wound healed in that way she thought her life was ended but her love for her mother unexpectedly showed her that the essence of life love was still active within her love awoke and so did life prince andrews last days had bound princess mary and natsha together this new sorrow brought them still closer to one another princess mary put off her departure and for three weeks looked after natsha as if she had been a sick child the last weeks passed in her mothers bedroom had strained natshas physical strength one afternoon noticing natsha shivering with fever princess mary took her to her own room and made her lie down on the bed natsha lay down but when princess mary had drawn the blinds and was going away she called her back i dont want to sleep mary sit by me a little you are tired try to sleep no no why did you bring me away she will be asking for me she is much better she spoke so well today said princess mary natsha lay on the bed and in the semidarkness of the room scanned princess marys face is she like him thought natsha yes like and yet not like but she is quite original strange new and unknown and she loves me what is in her heart all that is good but how what is her mind like what does she think about me yes she is splendid mary she said timidly drawing princess marys hand to herself mary you mustnt think me wicked no mary darling how i love you let us be quite quite friends and natsha embracing her began kissing her face and hands making princess mary feel shy but happy by this demonstration of her feelings from that day a tender and passionate friendship such as exists only between women was established between princess mary and natsha they were continually kissing and saying tender things to one another and spent most of their time together when one went out the other became restless and hastened to rejoin her together they felt more in harmony with one another than either of them felt with herself when alone a feeling stronger than friendship sprang up between them
