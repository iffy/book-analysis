childishness he went up to the map and speaking rapidly began proving that no eventuality could alter the efficiency of the drissa camp that everything had been foreseen and that if the enemy were really going to outflank it the enemy would inevitably be destroyed paulucci who did not know german began questioning him in french wolzogen came to the assistance of his chief who spoke french badly and began translating for him hardly able to keep pace with pfuel who was rapidly demonstrating that not only all that had happened but all that could happen had been foreseen in his scheme and that if there were now any difficulties the whole fault lay in the fact that his plan had not been precisely executed he kept laughing sarcastically he demonstrated and at last contemptuously ceased to demonstrate like a mathematician who ceases to prove in various ways the accuracy of a problem that has already been proved wolzogen took his place and continued to explain his views in french every now and then turning to pfuel and saying is it not so your excellency but pfuel like a man heated in a fight who strikes those on his own side shouted angrily at his own supporter wolzogen well of course what more is there to explain paulucci and michaud both attacked wolzogen simultaneously in french armfeldt addressed pfuel in german toll explained to volknski in russian prince andrew listened and observed in silence of all these men prince andrew sympathized most with pfuel angry determined and absurdly self-confident as he was of all those present evidently he alone was not seeking anything for himself nursed no hatred against anyone and only desired that the plan formed on a theory arrived at by years of toil should be carried out he was ridiculous and unpleasantly sarcastic but yet he inspired involuntary respect by his boundless devotion to an idea besides this the remarks of all except pfuel had one common trait that had not been noticeable at the council of war in there was now a panic fear of napoleons genius which though concealed was noticeable in every rejoinder everything was assumed to be possible for napoleon they expected him from every side and invoked his terrible name to shatter each others proposals pfuel alone seemed to consider napoleon a barbarian like everyone else who opposed his theory but besides this feeling of respect pfuel evoked pity in prince andrew from the tone in which the courtiers addressed him and the way paulucci had allowed himself to speak of him to the emperor but above all from a certain desperation in pfuels own expressions it was clear that the others knew and pfuel himself felt that his fall was at hand and despite his self-confidence and grumpy german sarcasm he was pitiable with his hair smoothly brushed on the temples and sticking up in tufts behind though he concealed the fact under a show of irritation and contempt he was evidently in despair that the sole remaining chance of verifying his theory by a huge experiment and proving its soundness to the whole world was slipping away from him the discussions continued a long time and the longer they lasted the more heated became the disputes culminating in shouts and personalities and the less was it possible to arrive at any general conclusion from all that had been said prince andrew listening to this polyglot talk and to these surmises plans refutations and shouts felt nothing but amazement at what they were saying a thought that had long since and often occurred to him during his military activities the idea that there is not and cannot be any science of war and that therefore there can be no such thing as a military genius now appeared to him an obvious truth what theory and science is possible about a matter the conditions and circumstances of which are unknown and cannot be defined especially when the strength of the acting forces cannot be ascertained no one was or is able to foresee in what condition our or the enemys armies will be in a days time and no one can gauge the force of this or that detachment sometimes when there is not a coward at the front to shout we are cut off and start running but a brave and jolly lad who shouts hurrah a detachment of five thousand is worth thirty thousand as at schn grabern while at times fifty thousand run from eight thousand as at austerlitz what science
