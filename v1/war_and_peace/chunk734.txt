at least some side of his activity and the more we perceive of these influences the more our conception of his freedom diminishes and the more our conception of the necessity that weighs on him increases the second consideration is the more or less evident time relation of the man to the world and the clearness of our perception of the place the mans action occupies in time that is the ground which makes the fall of the first man resulting in the production of the human race appear evidently less free than a mans entry into marriage today it is the reason why the life and activity of people who lived centuries ago and are connected with me in time cannot seem to me as free as the life of a contemporary the consequences of which are still unknown to me the degree of our conception of freedom or inevitability depends in this respect on the greater or lesser lapse of time between the performance of the action and our judgment of it if i examine an act i performed a moment ago in approximately the same circumstances as those i am in now my action appears to me undoubtedly free but if i examine an act performed a month ago then being in different circumstances i cannot help recognizing that if that act had not been committed much that resulted from it good agreeable and even essential would not have taken place if i reflect on an action still more remote ten years ago or more then the consequences of my action are still plainer to me and i find it hard to imagine what would have happened had that action not been performed the farther i go back in memory or what is the same thing the farther i go forward in my judgment the more doubtful becomes my belief in the freedom of my action in history we find a very similar progress of conviction concerning the part played by free will in the general affairs of humanity a contemporary event seems to us to be indubitably the doing of all the known participants but with a more remote event we already see its inevitable results which prevent our considering anything else possible and the farther we go back in examining events the less arbitrary do they appear the austro-prussian war appears to us undoubtedly the result of the crafty conduct of bismarck and so on the napoleonic wars still seem to us though already questionably to be the outcome of their heroes will but in the crusades we already see an event occupying its definite place in history and without which we cannot imagine the modern history of europe though to the chroniclers of the crusades that event appeared as merely due to the will of certain people in regard to the migration of the peoples it does not enter anyones head today to suppose that the renovation of the european world depended on attilas caprice the farther back in history the object of our observation lies the more doubtful does the free will of those concerned in the event become and the more manifest the law of inevitability the third consideration is the degree to which we apprehend that endless chain of causation inevitably demanded by reason in which each phenomenon comprehended and therefore mans every action must have its definite place as a result of what has gone before and as a cause of what will follow the better we are acquainted with the physiological psychological and historical laws deduced by observation and by which man is controlled and the more correctly we perceive the physiological psychological and historical causes of the action and the simpler the action we are observing and the less complex the character and mind of the man in question the more subject to inevitability and the less free do our actions and those of others appear when we do not at all understand the cause of an action whether a crime a good action or even one that is simply nonmoral we ascribe a greater amount of freedom to it in the case of a crime we most urgently demand the punishment for such an act in the case of a virtuous act we rate its merit most highly in an indifferent case we recognize in it more individuality originality and independence but if even one of the innumerable causes of the act is known to us we recognize a certain element of necessity and are less insistent on punishment
