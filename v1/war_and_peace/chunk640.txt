french camp and ptya gave the cossack a detailed account not only of his ride but also of his object and why he considered it better to risk his life than to act just anyhow well you should get some sleep now said the cossack no i am used to this said ptya i say arent the flints in your pistols worn out i brought some with me dont you want any you can have some the cossack bent forward from under the wagon to get a closer look at ptya because i am accustomed to doing everything accurately said ptya some fellows do things just anyhow without preparation and then theyre sorry for it afterwards i dont like that just so said the cossack oh yes another thing please my dear fellow will you sharpen my saber for me its got bl ptya feared to tell a lie and the saber never had been sharpened can you do it of course i can likhachv got up rummaged in his pack and soon ptya heard the warlike sound of steel on whetstone he climbed onto the wagon and sat on its edge the cossack was sharpening the saber under the wagon i say are the lads asleep asked ptya some are and some arent like us well and that boy vesnny oh hes thrown himself down there in the passage fast asleep after his fright he was that glad after that ptya remained silent for a long time listening to the sounds he heard footsteps in the darkness and a black figure appeared what are you sharpening asked a man coming up to the wagon why this gentlemans saber thats right said the man whom ptya took to be an hussar was the cup left here there by the wheel the hussar took the cup it must be daylight soon said he yawning and went away ptya ought to have known that he was in a forest with densovs guerrilla band less than a mile from the road sitting on a wagon captured from the french beside which horses were tethered that under it likhachv was sitting sharpening a saber for him that the big dark blotch to the right was the watchmans hut and the red blotch below to the left was the dying embers of a campfire that the man who had come for the cup was an hussar who wanted a drink but he neither knew nor waited to know anything of all this he was in a fairy kingdom where nothing resembled reality the big dark blotch might really be the watchmans hut or it might be a cavern leading to the very depths of the earth perhaps the red spot was a fire or it might be the eye of an enormous monster perhaps he was really sitting on a wagon but it might very well be that he was not sitting on a wagon but on a terribly high tower from which if he fell he would have to fall for a whole day or a whole month or go on falling and never reach the bottom perhaps it was just the cossack likhachv who was sitting under the wagon but it might be the kindest bravest most wonderful most splendid man in the world whom no one knew of it might really have been that the hussar came for water and went back into the hollow but perhaps he had simply vanished disappeared altogether and dissolved into nothingness nothing ptya could have seen now would have surprised him he was in a fairy kingdom where everything was possible he looked up at the sky and the sky was a fairy realm like the earth it was clearing and over the tops of the trees clouds were swiftly sailing as if unveiling the stars sometimes it looked as if the clouds were passing and a clear black sky appeared sometimes it seemed as if the black spaces were clouds sometimes the sky seemed to be rising high high overhead and then it seemed to sink so low that one could touch it with ones hand ptyas eyes began to close and he swayed a little the trees were dripping quiet talking was heard the horses neighed and jostled one another someone snored ozheg-zheg ozheg-zheg hissed the saber against the whetstone and suddenly ptya heard an harmonious orchestra playing some unknown sweetly solemn hymn ptya was as musical as natsha and more so than nicholas but had never learned music or thought about it and so the
