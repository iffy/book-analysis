that the next part of the line the guards was already in action so much the better i shall see it close he thought he was riding almost along the front line a handful of men came galloping toward him they were our uhlans who with disordered ranks were returning from the attack rostv got out of their way involuntarily noticed that one of them was bleeding and galloped on that is no business of mine he thought he had not ridden many hundred yards after that before he saw to his left across the whole width of the field an enormous mass of cavalry in brilliant white uniforms mounted on black horses trotting straight toward him and across his path rostv put his horse to full gallop to get out of the way of these men and he would have got clear had they continued at the same speed but they kept increasing their pace so that some of the horses were already galloping rostv heard the thud of their hoofs and the jingle of their weapons and saw their horses their figures and even their faces more and more distinctly they were our horse guards advancing to attack the french cavalry that was coming to meet them the horse guards were galloping but still holding in their horses rostv could already see their faces and heard the command charge shouted by an officer who was urging his thoroughbred to full speed rostv fearing to be crushed or swept into the attack on the french galloped along the front as hard as his horse could go but still was not in time to avoid them the last of the horse guards a huge pockmarked fellow frowned angrily on seeing rostv before him with whom he would inevitably collide this guardsman would certainly have bowled rostv and his bedouin over rostv felt himself quite tiny and weak compared to these gigantic men and horses had it not occurred to rostv to flourish his whip before the eyes of the guardsmans horse the heavy black horse sixteen hands high shied throwing back its ears but the pockmarked guardsman drove his huge spurs in violently and the horse flourishing its tail and extending its neck galloped on yet faster hardly had the horse guards passed rostv before he heard them shout hurrah and looking back saw that their foremost ranks were mixed up with some foreign cavalry with red epaulets probably french he could see nothing more for immediately afterwards cannon began firing from somewhere and smoke enveloped everything at that moment as the horse guards having passed him disappeared in the smoke rostv hesitated whether to gallop after them or to go where he was sent this was the brilliant charge of the horse guards that amazed the french themselves rostv was horrified to hear later that of all that mass of huge and handsome men of all those brilliant rich youths officers and cadets who had galloped past him on their thousand-ruble horses only eighteen were left after the charge why should i envy them my chance is not lost and maybe i shall see the emperor immediately thought rostv and galloped on when he came level with the foot guards he noticed that about them and around them cannon balls were flying of which he was aware not so much because he heard their sound as because he saw uneasiness on the soldiers faces and unnatural warlike solemnity on those of the officers passing behind one of the lines of a regiment of foot guards he heard a voice calling him by name rostv what he answered not recognizing bors i say weve been in the front line our regiment attacked said bors with the happy smile seen on the faces of young men who have been under fire for the first time rostv stopped have you he said well how did it go we drove them back said bors with animation growing talkative can you imagine it and he began describing how the guards having taken up their position and seeing troops before them thought they were austrians and all at once discovered from the cannon balls discharged by those troops that they were themselves in the front line and had unexpectedly to go into action rostv without hearing bors to the end spurred his horse where are you off to asked bors with a message to his majesty there he is said bors thinking rostv had said his highness and pointing to the grand duke who with his high
