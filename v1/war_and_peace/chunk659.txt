of the campaign he had prevented their vanquishing napoleon that he thought of nothing but satisfying his passions and would not advance from the linen factories because he was comfortable there that at krsnoe he checked the advance because on learning that napoleon was there he had quite lost his head and that it was probable that he had an understanding with napoleon and had been bribed by him and so on and so on not only did his contemporaries carried away by their passions talk in this way but posterity and history have acclaimed napoleon as grand while kutzov is described by foreigners as a crafty dissolute weak old courtier and by russians as something indefinite a sort of puppet useful only because he had a russian name chapter v in and kutzov was openly accused of blundering the emperor was dissatisfied with him and in a history recently written by order of the highest authorities it is said that kutzov was a cunning court liar frightened of the name of napoleon and that by his blunders at krsnoe and the berzina he deprived the russian army of the glory of complete victory over the french history of the year the character of kutzov and reflections on the unsatisfactory results of the battles at krsnoe by bogdnovich such is the fate not of great men grands hommes whom the russian mind does not acknowledge but of those rare and always solitary individuals who discerning the will of providence submit their personal will to it the hatred and contempt of the crowd punish such men for discerning the higher laws for russian historians strange and terrible to say napoleon that most insignificant tool of history who never anywhere even in exile showed human dignity napoleon is the object of adulation and enthusiasm he is grand but kutzov the man who from the beginning to the end of his activity in never once swerving by word or deed from borodin to vlna presented an example exceptional in history of self-sacrifice and a present consciousness of the future importance of what was happening kutzov seems to them something indefinite and pitiful and when speaking of him and of the year they always seem a little ashamed and yet it is difficult to imagine an historical character whose activity was so unswervingly directed to a single aim and it would be difficult to imagine any aim more worthy or more consonant with the will of the whole people still more difficult would it be to find an instance in history of the aim of an historical personage being so completely accomplished as that to which all kutzovs efforts were directed in kutzov never talked of forty centuries looking down from the pyramids of the sacrifices he offered for the fatherland or of what he intended to accomplish or had accomplished in general he said nothing about himself adopted no pose always appeared to be the simplest and most ordinary of men and said the simplest and most ordinary things he wrote letters to his daughters and to madame de stal read novels liked the society of pretty women jested with generals officers and soldiers and never contradicted those who tried to prove anything to him when count rostopchn at the yaza bridge galloped up to kutzov with personal reproaches for having caused the destruction of moscow and said how was it you promised not to abandon moscow without a battle kutzov replied and i shall not abandon moscow without a battle though moscow was then already abandoned when arakchev coming to him from the emperor said that ermlov ought to be appointed chief of the artillery kutzov replied yes i was just saying so myself though a moment before he had said quite the contrary what did it matter to him who then alone amid a senseless crowd understood the whole tremendous significance of what was happening what did it matter to him whether rostopchn attributed the calamities of moscow to him or to himself still less could it matter to him who was appointed chief of the artillery not merely in these cases but continually did that old man who by experience of life had reached the conviction that thoughts and the words serving as their expression are not what move people use quite meaningless words that happened to enter his head but that man so heedless of his words did not once during the whole time of his activity utter one word inconsistent with the single aim toward which he moved throughout the
