the buying of expensive seed corn and did not make a hobby of any particular part of the work on his estate he always had before his minds eye the estate as a whole and not any particular part of it the chief thing in his eyes was not the nitrogen in the soil nor the oxygen in the air nor manures nor special plows but that most important agent by which nitrogen oxygen manure and plow were made effective the peasant laborer when nicholas first began farming and began to understand its different branches it was the serf who especially attracted his attention the peasant seemed to him not merely a tool but also a judge of farming and an end in himself at first he watched the serfs trying to understand their aims and what they considered good and bad and only pretended to direct them and give orders while in reality learning from them their methods their manner of speech and their judgment of what was good and bad only when he had understood the peasants tastes and aspirations had learned to talk their language to grasp the hidden meaning of their words and felt akin to them did he begin boldly to manage his serfs that is to perform toward them the duties demanded of him and nicholas management produced very brilliant results guided by some gift of insight on taking up the management of the estates he at once unerringly appointed as bailiff village elder and delegate the very men the serfs would themselves have chosen had they had the right to choose and these posts never changed hands before analyzing the properties of manure before entering into the debit and credit as he ironically called it he found out how many cattle the peasants had and increased the number by all possible means he kept the peasant families together in the largest groups possible not allowing the family groups to divide into separate households he was hard alike on the lazy the depraved and the weak and tried to get them expelled from the commune he was as careful of the sowing and reaping of the peasants hay and corn as of his own and few landowners had their crops sown and harvested so early and so well or got so good a return as did nicholas he disliked having anything to do with the domestic serfs the drones as he called them and everyone said he spoiled them by his laxity when a decision had to be taken regarding a domestic serf especially if one had to be punished he always felt undecided and consulted everybody in the house but when it was possible to have a domestic serf conscripted instead of a land worker he did so without the least hesitation he never felt any hesitation in dealing with the peasants he knew that his every decision would be approved by them all with very few exceptions he did not allow himself either to be hard on or punish a man or to make things easy for or reward anyone merely because he felt inclined to do so he could not have said by what standard he judged what he should or should not do but the standard was quite firm and definite in his own mind often speaking with vexation of some failure or irregularity he would say what can one do with our russian peasants and imagined that he could not bear them yet he loved our russian peasants and their way of life with his whole soul and for that very reason had understood and assimilated the one way and manner of farming which produced good results countess mary was jealous of this passion of her husbands and regretted that she could not share it but she could not understand the joys and vexations he derived from that world to her so remote and alien she could not understand why he was so particularly animated and happy when after getting up at daybreak and spending the whole morning in the fields or on the threshing floor he returned from the sowing or mowing or reaping to have tea with her she did not understand why he spoke with such admiration and delight of the farming of the thrifty and well-to-do peasant matthew ermshin who with his family had carted corn all night or of the fact that his nicholas sheaves were already stacked before anyone else had his harvest in she did not understand why he stepped out from the window
