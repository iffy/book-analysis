after the lapse of some time turn out to be mistaken in his view of what is good for humanity this assumption is all the more natural and inevitable because watching the movement of history we see that every year and with each new writer opinion as to what is good for mankind changes so that what once seemed good ten years later seems bad and vice versa and what is more we find at one and the same time quite contradictory views as to what is bad and what is good in history some people regard giving a constitution to poland and forming the holy alliance as praiseworthy in alexander while others regard it as blameworthy the activity of alexander or of napoleon cannot be called useful or harmful for it is impossible to say for what it was useful or harmful if that activity displeases somebody this is only because it does not agree with his limited understanding of what is good whether the preservation of my fathers house in moscow or the glory of the russian arms or the prosperity of the petersburg and other universities or the freedom of poland or the greatness of russia or the balance of power in europe or a certain kind of european culture called progress appear to me to be good or bad i must admit that besides these things the action of every historic character has other more general purposes inaccessible to me but let us assume that what is called science can harmonize all contradictions and possesses an unchanging standard of good and bad by which to try historic characters and events let us say that alexander could have done everything differently let us say that with guidance from those who blame him and who profess to know the ultimate aim of the movement of humanity he might have arranged matters according to the program his present accusers would have given him of nationality freedom equality and progress these i think cover the ground let us assume that this program was possible and had then been formulated and that alexander had acted on it what would then have become of the activity of all those who opposed the tendency that then prevailed in the government an activity that in the opinion of the historians was good and beneficent their activity would not have existed there would have been no life there would have been nothing if we admit that human life can be ruled by reason the possibility of life is destroyed chapter ii if we assume as the historians do that great men lead humanity to the attainment of certain ends the greatness of russia or of france the balance of power in europe the diffusion of the ideas of the revolution general progress or anything else then it is impossible to explain the facts of history without introducing the conceptions of chance and genius if the aim of the european wars at the beginning of the nineteenth century had been the aggrandizement of russia that aim might have been accomplished without all the preceding wars and without the invasion if the aim was the aggrandizement of france that might have been attained without the revolution and without the empire if the aim was the dissemination of ideas the printing press could have accomplished that much better than warfare if the aim was the progress of civilization it is easy to see that there are other ways of diffusing civilization more expedient than by the destruction of wealth and of human lives why did it happen in this and not in some other way because it happened so chance created the situation genius utilized it says history but what is chance what is genius the words chance and genius do not denote any really existing thing and therefore cannot be defined those words only denote a certain stage of understanding of phenomena i do not know why a certain event occurs i think that i cannot know it so i do not try to know it and i talk about chance i see a force producing effects beyond the scope of ordinary human agencies i do not understand why this occurs and i talk of genius to a herd of rams the ram the herdsman drives each evening into a special enclosure to feed and that becomes twice as fat as the others must seem to be a genius and it must appear an astonishing conjunction of genius with a whole series of extraordinary chances that this ram who
