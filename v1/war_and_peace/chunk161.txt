that in a hollow between two hills near the village of pratzen the russian columns their bayonets glittering were moving continuously in one direction toward the valley and disappearing one after another into the mist from information he had received the evening before from the sound of wheels and footsteps heard by the outposts during the night by the disorderly movement of the russian columns and from all indications he saw clearly that the allies believed him to be far away in front of them and that the columns moving near pratzen constituted the center of the russian army and that that center was already sufficiently weakened to be successfully attacked but still he did not begin the engagement today was a great day for him the anniversary of his coronation before dawn he had slept for a few hours and refreshed vigorous and in good spirits he mounted his horse and rode out into the field in that happy mood in which everything seems possible and everything succeeds he sat motionless looking at the heights visible above the mist and his cold face wore that special look of confident self-complacent happiness that one sees on the face of a boy happily in love the marshals stood behind him not venturing to distract his attention he looked now at the pratzen heights now at the sun floating up out of the mist when the sun had entirely emerged from the fog and fields and mist were aglow with dazzling light as if he had only awaited this to begin the action he drew the glove from his shapely white hand made a sign with it to the marshals and ordered the action to begin the marshals accompanied by adjutants galloped off in different directions and a few minutes later the chief forces of the french army moved rapidly toward those pratzen heights which were being more and more denuded by russian troops moving down the valley to their left chapter xv at eight oclock kutzov rode to pratzen at the head of the fourth column milordovichs the one that was to take the place of przebyszwskis and langerons columns which had already gone down into the valley he greeted the men of the foremost regiment and gave them the order to march thereby indicating that he intended to lead that column himself when he had reached the village of pratzen he halted prince andrew was behind among the immense number forming the commander in chiefs suite he was in a state of suppressed excitement and irritation though controlledly calm as a man is at the approach of a long-awaited moment he was firmly convinced that this was the day of his toulon or his bridge of arcola how it would come about he did not know but he felt sure it would do so the locality and the position of our troops were known to him as far as they could be known to anyone in our army his own strategic plan which obviously could not now be carried out was forgotten now entering into weyrothers plan prince andrew considered possible contingencies and formed new projects such as might call for his rapidity of perception and decision to the left down below in the mist the musketry fire of unseen forces could be heard it was there prince andrew thought the fight would concentrate there we shall encounter difficulties and there thought he i shall be sent with a brigade or division and there standard in hand i shall go forward and break whatever is in front of me he could not look calmly at the standards of the passing battalions seeing them he kept thinking that may be the very standard with which i shall lead the army in the morning all that was left of the night mist on the heights was a hoar frost now turning to dew but in the valleys it still lay like a milk-white sea nothing was visible in the valley to the left into which our troops had descended and from whence came the sounds of firing above the heights was the dark clear sky and to the right the vast orb of the sun in front far off on the farther shore of that sea of mist some wooded hills were discernible and it was there the enemy probably was for something could be descried on the right the guards were entering the misty region with a sound of hoofs and wheels and now and then a gleam of bayonets to the left
