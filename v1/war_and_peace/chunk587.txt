old frenchman with a thick mustache trembled as he untied the ropes the body collapsed the soldiers dragged it awkwardly from the post and began pushing it into the pit they all plainly and certainly knew that they were criminals who must hide the traces of their guilt as quickly as possible pierre glanced into the pit and saw that the factory lad was lying with his knees close up to his head and one shoulder higher than the other that shoulder rose and fell rhythmically and convulsively but spadefuls of earth were already being thrown over the whole body one of the soldiers evidently suffering shouted gruffly and angrily at pierre to go back but pierre did not understand him and remained near the post and no one drove him away when the pit had been filled up a command was given pierre was taken back to his place and the rows of troops on both sides of the post made a half turn and went past it at a measured pace the twenty-four sharpshooters with discharged muskets standing in the center of the circle ran back to their places as the companies passed by pierre gazed now with dazed eyes at these sharpshooters who ran in couples out of the circle all but one rejoined their companies this one a young soldier his face deadly pale his shako pushed back and his musket resting on the ground still stood near the pit at the spot from which he had fired he swayed like a drunken man taking some steps forward and back to save himself from falling an old noncommissioned officer ran out of the ranks and taking him by the elbow dragged him to his company the crowd of russians and frenchmen began to disperse they all went away silently and with drooping heads that will teach them to start fires said one of the frenchmen pierre glanced round at the speaker and saw that it was a soldier who was trying to find some relief after what had been done but was not able to do so without finishing what he had begun to say he made a hopeless movement with his arm and went away chapter xii after the execution pierre was separated from the rest of the prisoners and placed alone in a small ruined and befouled church toward evening a noncommissioned officer entered with two soldiers and told him that he had been pardoned and would now go to the barracks for the prisoners of war without understanding what was said to him pierre got up and went with the soldiers they took him to the upper end of the field where there were some sheds built of charred planks beams and battens and led him into one of them in the darkness some twenty different men surrounded pierre he looked at them without understanding who they were why they were there or what they wanted of him he heard what they said but did not understand the meaning of the words and made no kind of deduction from or application of them he replied to questions they put to him but did not consider who was listening to his replies nor how they would understand them he looked at their faces and figures but they all seemed to him equally meaningless from the moment pierre had witnessed those terrible murders committed by men who did not wish to commit them it was as if the mainspring of his life on which everything depended and which made everything appear alive had suddenly been wrenched out and everything had collapsed into a heap of meaningless rubbish though he did not acknowledge it to himself his faith in the right ordering of the universe in humanity in his own soul and in god had been destroyed he had experienced this before but never so strongly as now when similar doubts had assailed him before they had been the result of his own wrongdoing and at the bottom of his heart he had felt that relief from his despair and from those doubts was to be found within himself but now he felt that the universe had crumbled before his eyes and only meaningless ruins remained and this not by any fault of his own he felt that it was not in his power to regain faith in the meaning of life around him in the darkness men were standing and evidently something about him interested them greatly they were telling him something and asking him something then
