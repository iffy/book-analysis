much transcend the general interests that they always prevent the public interest from being felt or even noticed most of the people at that time paid no attention to the general progress of events but were guided only by their private interests and they were the very people whose activities at that period were most useful those who tried to understand the general course of events and to take part in it by self-sacrifice and heroism were the most useless members of society they saw everything upside down and all they did for the common good turned out to be useless and foolish like pierres and mamnovs regiments which looted russian villages and the lint the young ladies prepared and that never reached the wounded and so on even those fond of intellectual talk and of expressing their feelings who discussed russias position at the time involuntarily introduced into their conversation either a shade of pretense and falsehood or useless condemnation and anger directed against people accused of actions no one could possibly be guilty of in historic events the rule forbidding us to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge is specially applicable only unconscious action bears fruit and he who plays a part in an historic event never understands its significance if he tries to realize it his efforts are fruitless the more closely a man was engaged in the events then taking place in russia the less did he realize their significance in petersburg and in the provinces at a distance from moscow ladies and gentlemen in militia uniforms wept for russia and its ancient capital and talked of self-sacrifice and so on but in the army which retired beyond moscow there was little talk or thought of moscow and when they caught sight of its burned ruins no one swore to be avenged on the french but they thought about their next pay their next quarters of matrshka the vivandire and like matters as the war had caught him in the service nicholas rostv took a close and prolonged part in the defense of his country but did so casually without any aim at self-sacrifice and he therefore looked at what was going on in russia without despair and without dismally racking his brains over it had he been asked what he thought of the state of russia he would have said that it was not his business to think about it that kutzov and others were there for that purpose but that he had heard that the regiments were to be made up to their full strength that fighting would probably go on for a long time yet and that things being so it was quite likely he might be in command of a regiment in a couple of years time as he looked at the matter in this way he learned that he was being sent to vornezh to buy remounts for his division not only without regret at being prevented from taking part in the coming battle but with the greatest pleasure which he did not conceal and which his comrades fully understood a few days before the battle of borodin nicholas received the necessary money and warrants and having sent some hussars on in advance he set out with post horses for vornezh only a man who has experienced it that is has passed some months continuously in an atmosphere of campaigning and war can understand the delight nicholas felt when he escaped from the region covered by the armys foraging operations provision trains and hospitals when free from soldiers wagons and the filthy traces of a camp he saw villages with peasants and peasant women gentlemens country houses fields where cattle were grazing posthouses with stationmasters asleep in them he rejoiced as though seeing all this for the first time what for a long while specially surprised and delighted him were the women young and healthy without a dozen officers making up to each of them women too who were pleased and flattered that a passing officer should joke with them in the highest spirits nicholas arrived at night at a hotel in vornezh ordered things he had long been deprived of in camp and next day very clean-shaven and in a full-dress uniform he had not worn for a long time went to present himself to the authorities the commander of the militia was a civilian general an old man who was evidently pleased with his military designation and rank he received nicholas brusquely imagining this to be characteristically military
