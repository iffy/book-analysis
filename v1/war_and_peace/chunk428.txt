at seeing the prince but made up his mind to address him nevertheless its very nice your excellency wouldnt you like to said he its dirty replied prince andrew making a grimace well clear it out for you in a minute said timkhin and still undressed ran off to clear the men out of the pond the prince wants to bathe what prince ours said many voices and the men were in such haste to clear out that the prince could hardly stop them he decided that he would rather wash himself with water in the barn flesh bodies cannon fodder he thought and he looked at his own naked body and shuddered not from cold but from a sense of disgust and horror he did not himself understand aroused by the sight of that immense number of bodies splashing about in the dirty pond on the seventh of august prince bagratin wrote as follows from his quarters at mikhylovna on the smolnsk road dear count alxis andrevich he was writing to arakchev but knew that his letter would be read by the emperor and therefore weighed every word in it to the best of his ability i expect the minister barclay de tolly has already reported the abandonment of smolnsk to the enemy it is pitiable and sad and the whole army is in despair that this most important place has been wantonly abandoned i for my part begged him personally most urgently and finally wrote him but nothing would induce him to consent i swear to you on my honor that napoleon was in such a fix as never before and might have lost half his army but could not have taken smolnsk our troops fought and are fighting as never before with fifteen thousand men i held the enemy at bay for thirty-five hours and beat him but he would not hold out even for fourteen hours it is disgraceful a stain on our army and as for him he ought it seems to me not to live if he reports that our losses were great it is not true perhaps about four thousand not more and not even that but even were they ten thousand thats war but the enemy has lost masses what would it have cost him to hold out for another two days they would have had to retire of their own accord for they had no water for men or horses he gave me his word he would not retreat but suddenly sent instructions that he was retiring that night we cannot fight in this way or we may soon bring the enemy to moscow there is a rumor that you are thinking of peace god forbid that you should make peace after all our sacrifices and such insane retreats you would set all russia against you and everyone of us would feel ashamed to wear the uniform if it has come to this we must fight as long as russia can and as long as there are men able to stand one man ought to be in command and not two your minister may perhaps be good as a minister but as a general he is not merely bad but execrable yet to him is entrusted the fate of our whole country i am really frantic with vexation forgive my writing boldly it is clear that the man who advocates the conclusion of a peace and that the minister should command the army does not love our sovereign and desires the ruin of us all so i write you frankly call out the militia for the minister is leading these visitors after him to moscow in a most masterly way the whole army feels great suspicion of the imperial aide-de-camp wolzogen he is said to be more napoleons man than ours and he is always advising the minister i am not merely civil to him but obey him like a corporal though i am his senior this is painful but loving my benefactor and sovereign i submit only i am sorry for the emperor that he entrusts our fine army to such as he consider that on our retreat we have lost by fatigue and left in the hospital more than fifteen thousand men and had we attacked this would not have happened tell me for gods sake what will russia our mother russia say to our being so frightened and why are we abandoning our good and gallant fatherland to such rabble and implanting feelings of hatred and shame in all our
