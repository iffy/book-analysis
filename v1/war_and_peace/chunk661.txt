campfires near dbroe an immense crowd of tattered prisoners buzzing with talk and wrapped and bandaged in anything they had been able to get hold of were standing in the road beside a long row of unharnessed french guns at the approach of the commander in chief the buzz of talk ceased and all eyes were fixed on kutzov who wearing a white cap with a red band and a padded overcoat that bulged on his round shoulders moved slowly along the road on his white horse one of the generals was reporting to him where the guns and prisoners had been captured kutzov seemed preoccupied and did not listen to what the general was saying he screwed up his eyes with a dissatisfied look as he gazed attentively and fixedly at these prisoners who presented a specially wretched appearance most of them were disfigured by frost-bitten noses and cheeks and nearly all had red swollen and festering eyes one group of the french stood close to the road and two of them one of whom had his face covered with sores were tearing a piece of raw flesh with their hands there was something horrible and bestial in the fleeting glance they threw at the riders and in the malevolent expression with which after a glance at kutzov the soldier with the sores immediately turned away and went on with what he was doing kutzov looked long and intently at these two soldiers he puckered his face screwed up his eyes and pensively swayed his head at another spot he noticed a russian soldier laughingly patting a frenchman on the shoulder saying something to him in a friendly manner and kutzov with the same expression on his face again swayed his head what were you saying he asked the general who continuing his report directed the commander in chiefs attention to some standards captured from the french and standing in front of the preobrazhnsk regiment ah the standards said kutzov evidently detaching himself with difficulty from the thoughts that preoccupied him he looked about him absently thousands of eyes were looking at him from all sides awaiting a word from him he stopped in front of the preobrazhnsk regiment sighed deeply and closed his eyes one of his suite beckoned to the soldiers carrying the standards to advance and surround the commander in chief with them kutzov was silent for a few seconds and then submitting with evident reluctance to the duty imposed by his position raised his head and began to speak a throng of officers surrounded him he looked attentively around at the circle of officers recognizing several of them i thank you all he said addressing the soldiers and then again the officers in the stillness around him his slowly uttered words were distinctly heard i thank you all for your hard and faithful service the victory is complete and russia will not forget you honor to you forever he paused and looked around lower its head lower it he said to a soldier who had accidentally lowered the french eagle he was holding before the preobrazhnsk standards lower lower thats it hurrah lads he added addressing the men with a rapid movement of his chin hur-r-rah roared thousands of voices while the soldiers were shouting kutzov leaned forward in his saddle and bowed his head and his eye lit up with a mild and apparently ironic gleam you see brothers said he when the shouts had ceased and all at once his voice and the expression of his face changed it was no longer the commander in chief speaking but an ordinary old man who wanted to tell his comrades something very important there was a stir among the throng of officers and in the ranks of the soldiers who moved that they might hear better what he was going to say you see brothers i know its hard for you but it cant be helped bear up it wont be for long now well see our visitors off and then well rest the tsar wont forget your service it is hard for you but still you are at home while they you see what they have come to said he pointing to the prisoners worse off than our poorest beggars while they were strong we didnt spare ourselves but now we may even pity them they are human beings too isnt it so lads he looked around and in the direct respectful wondering gaze fixed upon him he read sympathy with what he had said his
