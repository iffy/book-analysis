nicholas yielding to that irresistible inclination which tempts us to judge those nearest and dearest to us he forgot that what he was saying about natsha could have been applied word for word to himself in relation to his wife yes i have noticed that said countess mary when i told him that duty and the oath were above everything he started proving goodness knows what a pity you were not there what would you have said as i see it you were quite right and i told natsha so pierre says everybody is suffering tortured and being corrupted and that it is our duty to help our neighbor of course he is right there said countess mary but he forgets that we have other duties nearer to us duties indicated to us by god himself and that though we might expose ourselves to risks we must not risk our children yes thats it thats just what i said to him put in nicholas who fancied he really had said it but they insisted on their own view love of ones neighbor and christianity and all this in the presence of young nicholas who had gone into my study and broke all my things ah nicholas do you know i am often troubled about little nicholas said countess mary he is such an exceptional boy i am afraid i neglect him in favor of my own we all have children and relations while he has no one he is constantly alone with his thoughts well i dont think you need reproach yourself on his account all that the fondest mother could do for her son you have done and are doing for him and of course i am glad of it he is a fine lad a fine lad this evening he listened to pierre in a sort of trance and fancy as we were going in to supper i looked and he had broken everything on my table to bits and he told me of it himself at once i never knew him to tell an untruth a fine lad a fine lad repeated nicholas who at heart was not fond of nicholas bolknski but was always anxious to recognize that he was a fine lad still i am not the same as his own mother said countess mary i feel i am not the same and it troubles me a wonderful boy but i am dreadfully afraid for him it would be good for him to have companions well it wont be for long next summer ill take him to petersburg said nicholas yes pierre always was a dreamer and always will be he continued returning to the talk in the study which had evidently disturbed him well what business is it of mine what goes on there whether arakchev is bad and all that what business was it of mine when i married and was so deep in debt that i was threatened with prison and had a mother who could not see or understand it and then there are you and the children and our affairs is it for my own pleasure that i am at the farm or in the office from morning to night no but i know i must work to comfort my mother to repay you and not to leave the children such beggars as i was countess mary wanted to tell him that man does not live by bread alone and that he attached too much importance to these matters but she knew she must not say this and that it would be useless to do so she only took his hand and kissed it he took this as a sign of approval and a confirmation of his thoughts and after a few minutes reflection continued to think aloud you know mary today elias mitrofnych this was his overseer came back from the tambv estate and told me they are already offering eighty thousand rubles for the forest and with an eager face nicholas began to speak of the possibility of repurchasing otrdnoe before long and added another ten years of life and i shall leave the children in an excellent position countess mary listened to her husband and understood all that he told her she knew that when he thought aloud in this way he would sometimes ask her what he had been saying and be vexed if he noticed that she had been thinking about something else but she had to force herself to attend for what he was saying did
