have come and am at your service to help you nurse my uncle i imagine what you have gone through and she sympathetically turned up her eyes the princess gave no reply and did not even smile but left the room as anna mikhylovna took off her gloves and occupying the position she had conquered settled down in an armchair inviting prince vasli to take a seat beside her bors she said to her son with a smile i shall go in to see the count my uncle but you my dear had better go to pierre meanwhile and dont forget to give him the rostvs invitation they ask him to dinner i suppose he wont go she continued turning to the prince on the contrary replied the prince who had plainly become depressed i shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that young man here he is and the count has not once asked for him he shrugged his shoulders a footman conducted bors down one flight of stairs and up another to pierres rooms chapter xvi pierre after all had not managed to choose a career for himself in petersburg and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and sent to moscow the story told about him at count rostvs was true pierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear he had now been for some days in moscow and was staying as usual at his fathers house though he expected that the story of his escapade would be already known in moscow and that the ladies about his father who were never favorably disposed toward him would have used it to turn the count against him he nevertheless on the day of his arrival went to his fathers part of the house entering the drawing room where the princesses spent most of their time he greeted the ladies two of whom were sitting at embroidery frames while a third read aloud it was the eldest who was reading the one who had met anna mikhylovna the two younger ones were embroidering both were rosy and pretty and they differed only in that one had a little mole on her lip which made her much prettier pierre was received as if he were a corpse or a leper the eldest princess paused in her reading and silently stared at him with frightened eyes the second assumed precisely the same expression while the youngest the one with the mole who was of a cheerful and lively disposition bent over her frame to hide a smile probably evoked by the amusing scene she foresaw she drew her wool down through the canvas and scarcely able to refrain from laughing stooped as if trying to make out the pattern how do you do cousin said pierre you dont recognize me i recognize you only too well too well how is the count can i see him asked pierre awkwardly as usual but unabashed the count is suffering physically and mentally and apparently you have done your best to increase his mental sufferings can i see the count pierre again asked hm if you wish to kill him to kill him outright you can see him olga go and see whether uncles beef tea is ready it is almost time she added giving pierre to understand that they were busy and busy making his father comfortable while evidently he pierre was only busy causing him annoyance olga went out pierre stood looking at the sisters then he bowed and said then i will go to my rooms you will let me know when i can see him and he left the room followed by the low but ringing laughter of the sister with the mole next day prince vasli had arrived and settled in the counts house he sent for pierre and said to him my dear fellow if you are going to behave here as you did in petersburg you will end very badly that is all i have to say to you the count is very very ill and you must not see him at all since then pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole time in his rooms upstairs when bors appeared at his door pierre was pacing up and down his room stopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at the wall as if running a sword through an invisible foe and glaring savagely over his spectacles and then again resuming his walk muttering indistinct words shrugging his shoulders
