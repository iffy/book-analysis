come about gave them some further instructions and was about to dismiss them when he heard a familiar lisping voice behind the shed devil take it said the voice of a man stumbling over something prince andrew looked out of the shed and saw pierre who had tripped over a pole on the ground and had nearly fallen coming his way it was unpleasant to prince andrew to meet people of his own set in general and pierre especially for he reminded him of all the painful moments of his last visit to moscow you what a surprise said he what brings you here this is unexpected as he said this his eyes and face expressed more than coldness they expressed hostility which pierre noticed at once he had approached the shed full of animation but on seeing prince andrews face he felt constrained and ill at ease i have come simply you know come it interests me said pierre who had so often that day senselessly repeated that word interesting i wish to see the battle oh yes and what do the masonic brothers say about war how would they stop it said prince andrew sarcastically well and hows moscow and my people have they reached moscow at last he asked seriously yes they have julie drubetskya told me so i went to see them but missed them they have gone to your estate near moscow chapter xxv the officers were about to take leave but prince andrew apparently reluctant to be left alone with his friend asked them to stay and have tea seats were brought in and so was the tea the officers gazed with surprise at pierres huge stout figure and listened to his talk of moscow and the position of our army round which he had ridden prince andrew remained silent and his expression was so forbidding that pierre addressed his remarks chiefly to the good-natured battalion commander so you understand the whole position of our troops prince andrew interrupted him yes that is how do you mean said pierre not being a military man i cant say i have understood it fully but i understand the general position well then you know more than anyone else be it who it may said prince andrew oh said pierre looking over his spectacles in perplexity at prince andrew well and what do you think of kutzovs appointment he asked i was very glad of his appointment thats all i know replied prince andrew and tell me your opinion of barclay de tolly in moscow they are saying heaven knows what about him what do you think of him ask them replied prince andrew indicating the officers pierre looked at timkhin with the condescendingly interrogative smile with which everybody involuntarily addressed that officer we see light again since his serenity has been appointed your excellency said timkhin timidly and continually turning to glance at his colonel why so asked pierre well to mention only firewood and fodder let me inform you why when we were retreating from sventsyni we dare not touch a stick or a wisp of hay or anything you see we were going away so he would get it all wasnt it so your excellency and again timkhin turned to the prince but we darent in our regiment two officers were court-martialed for that kind of thing but when his serenity took command everything became straightforward now we see light then why was it forbidden timkhin looked about in confusion not knowing what or how to answer such a question pierre put the same question to prince andrew why so as not to lay waste the country we were abandoning to the enemy said prince andrew with venomous irony it is very sound one cant permit the land to be pillaged and accustom the troops to marauding at smolnsk too he judged correctly that the french might outflank us as they had larger forces but he could not understand this cried prince andrew in a shrill voice that seemed to escape him involuntarily he could not understand that there for the first time we were fighting for russian soil and that there was a spirit in the men such as i had never seen before that we had held the french for two days and that that success had increased our strength tenfold he ordered us to retreat and all our efforts and losses went for nothing he had no thought of betraying us he tried to do the best he could he thought out everything
