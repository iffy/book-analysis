do you get on with that german asked rostv with a contemptuous smile he is a very very nice honest and pleasant fellow answered bors again rostv looked intently into bors eyes and sighed berg returned and over the bottle of wine conversation between the three officers became animated the guardsmen told rostv of their march and how they had been made much of in russia poland and abroad they spoke of the sayings and doings of their commander the grand duke and told stories of his kindness and irascibility berg as usual kept silent when the subject did not relate to himself but in connection with the stories of the grand dukes quick temper he related with gusto how in galicia he had managed to deal with the grand duke when the latter made a tour of the regiments and was annoyed at the irregularity of a movement with a pleasant smile berg related how the grand duke had ridden up to him in a violent passion shouting arnauts arnauts was the tsarvichs favorite expression when he was in a rage and called for the company commander would you believe it count i was not at all alarmed because i knew i was right without boasting you know i may say that i know the army orders by heart and know the regulations as well as i do the lords prayer so count there never is any negligence in my company and so my conscience was at ease i came forward berg stood up and showed how he presented himself with his hand to his cap and really it would have been difficult for a face to express greater respect and self-complacency than his did well he stormed at me as the saying is stormed and stormed and stormed it was not a matter of life but rather of death as the saying is albanians and devils and to siberia said berg with a sagacious smile i knew i was in the right so i kept silent was not that best count hey are you dumb he shouted still i remained silent and what do you think count the next day it was not even mentioned in the orders of the day thats what keeping ones head means thats the way count said berg lighting his pipe and emitting rings of smoke yes that was fine said rostv smiling but bors noticed that he was preparing to make fun of berg and skillfully changed the subject he asked him to tell them how and where he got his wound this pleased rostv and he began talking about it and as he went on became more and more animated he told them of his schn grabern affair just as those who have taken part in a battle generally do describe it that is as they would like it to have been as they have heard it described by others and as sounds well but not at all as it really was rostv was a truthful young man and would on no account have told a deliberate lie he began his story meaning to tell everything just as it happened but imperceptibly involuntarily and inevitably he lapsed into falsehood if he had told the truth to his hearers who like himself had often heard stories of attacks and had formed a definite idea of what an attack was and were expecting to hear just such a story they would either not have believed him or still worse would have thought that rostv was himself to blame since what generally happens to the narrators of cavalry attacks had not happened to him he could not tell them simply that everyone went at a trot and that he fell off his horse and sprained his arm and then ran as hard as he could from a frenchman into the wood besides to tell everything as it really happened it would have been necessary to make an effort of will to tell only what happened it is very difficult to tell the truth and young people are rarely capable of it his hearers expected a story of how beside himself and all aflame with excitement he had flown like a storm at the square cut his way in slashed right and left how his saber had tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted and so on and so he told them all that in the middle of his story just as he was saying you cannot imagine what a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack
