clerk with cuffs turned up was hastily writing at a tub turned bottom upwards kozlvskis face looked worn he too had evidently not slept all night he glanced at prince andrew and did not even nod to him second line have you written it he continued dictating to the clerk the kiev grenadiers podolian one cant write so fast your honor said the clerk glancing angrily and disrespectfully at kozlvski through the door came the sounds of kutzovs voice excited and dissatisfied interrupted by another an unfamiliar voice from the sound of these voices the inattentive way kozlvski looked at him the disrespectful manner of the exhausted clerk the fact that the clerk and kozlvski were squatting on the floor by a tub so near to the commander in chief and from the noisy laughter of the cossacks holding the horses near the window prince andrew felt that something important and disastrous was about to happen he turned to kozlvski with urgent questions immediately prince said kozlvski dispositions for bagratin what about capitulation nothing of the sort orders are issued for a battle prince andrew moved toward the door from whence voices were heard just as he was going to open it the sounds ceased the door opened and kutzov with his eagle nose and puffy face appeared in the doorway prince andrew stood right in front of kutzov but the expression of the commander in chiefs one sound eye showed him to be so preoccupied with thoughts and anxieties as to be oblivious of his presence he looked straight at his adjutants face without recognizing him well have you finished said he to kozlvski one moment your excellency bagratin a gaunt middle-aged man of medium height with a firm impassive face of oriental type came out after the commander in chief i have the honor to present myself repeated prince andrew rather loudly handing kutzov an envelope ah from vienna very good later later kutzov went out into the porch with bagratin well good-by prince said he to bagratin my blessing and may christ be with you in your great endeavor his face suddenly softened and tears came into his eyes with his left hand he drew bagratin toward him and with his right on which he wore a ring he made the sign of the cross over him with a gesture evidently habitual offering his puffy cheek but bagratin kissed him on the neck instead christ be with you kutzov repeated and went toward his carriage get in with me said he to bolknski your excellency i should like to be of use here allow me to remain with prince bagratins detachment get in said kutzov and noticing that bolknski still delayed he added i need good officers myself need them myself they got into the carriage and drove for a few minutes in silence there is still much much before us he said as if with an old mans penetration he understood all that was passing in bolknskis mind if a tenth part of his detachment returns i shall thank god he added as if speaking to himself prince andrew glanced at kutzovs face only a foot distant from him and involuntarily noticed the carefully washed seams of the scar near his temple where an ismail bullet had pierced his skull and the empty eye socket yes he has a right to speak so calmly of those mens death thought bolknski that is why i beg to be sent to that detachment he said kutzov did not reply he seemed to have forgotten what he had been saying and sat plunged in thought five minutes later gently swaying on the soft springs of the carriage he turned to prince andrew there was not a trace of agitation on his face with delicate irony he questioned prince andrew about the details of his interview with the emperor about the remarks he had heard at court concerning the krems affair and about some ladies they both knew chapter xiv on november kutzov had received through a spy news that the army he commanded was in an almost hopeless position the spy reported that the french after crossing the bridge at vienna were advancing in immense force upon kutzovs line of communication with the troops that were arriving from russia if kutzov decided to remain at krems napoleons army of one hundred and fifty thousand men would cut him off completely and surround his exhausted army of forty thousand and he would find himself in the position of mack at ulm if
