harness she cried panting she had apparently been running and i did so wish to have another talk with you alone god knows how long we may again be parted you are not angry with me for coming you have changed so andrsha she added as if to explain such a question she smiled as she uttered his pet name andrsha it was obviously strange to her to think that this stern handsome man should be andrsha the slender mischievous boy who had been her playfellow in childhood and where is lise he asked answering her question only by a smile she was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room oh andrew what a treasure of a wife you have said she sitting down on the sofa facing her brother she is quite a child such a dear merry child i have grown so fond of her prince andrew was silent but the princess noticed the ironical and contemptuous look that showed itself on his face one must be indulgent to little weaknesses who is free from them andrew dont forget that she has grown up and been educated in society and so her position now is not a rosy one we should enter into everyones situation tout comprendre cest tout pardonner think what it must be for her poor thing after what she has been used to to be parted from her husband and be left alone in the country in her condition its very hard to understand all is to forgive all prince andrew smiled as he looked at his sister as we smile at those we think we thoroughly understand you live in the country and dont think the life terrible he replied i thats different why speak of me i dont want any other life and cant for i know no other but think andrew for a young society woman to be buried in the country during the best years of her life all alone for papa is always busy and i well you know what poor resources i have for entertaining a woman used to the best society there is only mademoiselle bourienne i dont like your mademoiselle bourienne at all said prince andrew no she is very nice and kind and above all shes much to be pitied she has no one no one to tell the truth i dont need her and shes even in my way you know i always was a savage and now am even more so i like being alone father likes her very much she and michael ivnovich are the two people to whom he is always gentle and kind because he has been a benefactor to them both as sterne says we dont love people so much for the good they have done us as for the good we have done them father took her when she was homeless after losing her own father she is very good-natured and my father likes her way of reading she reads to him in the evenings and reads splendidly to be quite frank mary i expect fathers character sometimes makes things trying for you doesnt it prince andrew asked suddenly princess mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question for me for me trying for me said she he always was rather harsh and now i should think hes getting very trying said prince andrew apparently speaking lightly of their father in order to puzzle or test his sister you are good in every way andrew but you have a kind of intellectual pride said the princess following the train of her own thoughts rather than the trend of the conversation and thats a great sin how can one judge father but even if one might what feeling except veneration could such a man as my father evoke and i am so contented and happy with him i only wish you were all as happy as i am her brother shook his head incredulously the only thing that is hard for me i will tell you the truth andrew is fathers way of treating religious subjects i dont understand how a man of his immense intellect can fail to see what is as clear as day and can go so far astray that is the only thing that makes me unhappy but even in this i can see lately a shade of improvement his satire has been less bitter of late and there was a monk he received and had a long talk with ah
