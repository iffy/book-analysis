and announced as the advesawies have wefused a weconciliation please pwoceed take your pistols and at the word thwee begin to advance o-ne t-wo thwee he shouted angrily and stepped aside the combatants advanced along the trodden tracks nearer and nearer to one another beginning to see one another through the mist they had the right to fire when they liked as they approached the barrier dlokhov walked slowly without raising his pistol looking intently with his bright sparkling blue eyes into his antagonists face his mouth wore its usual semblance of a smile so i can fire when i like said pierre and at the word three he went quickly forward missing the trodden path and stepping into the deep snow he held the pistol in his right hand at arms length apparently afraid of shooting himself with it his left hand he held carefully back because he wished to support his right hand with it and knew he must not do so having advanced six paces and strayed off the track into the snow pierre looked down at his feet then quickly glanced at dlokhov and bending his finger as he had been shown fired not at all expecting so loud a report pierre shuddered at the sound and then smiling at his own sensations stood still the smoke rendered denser by the mist prevented him from seeing anything for an instant but there was no second report as he had expected he only heard dlokhovs hurried steps and his figure came in view through the smoke he was pressing one hand to his left side while the other clutched his drooping pistol his face was pale rostv ran toward him and said something no-o-o muttered dlokhov through his teeth no its not over and after stumbling a few staggering steps right up to the saber he sank on the snow beside it his left hand was bloody he wiped it on his coat and supported himself with it his frowning face was pallid and quivered plea began dlokhov but could not at first pronounce the word please he uttered with an effort pierre hardly restraining his sobs began running toward dlokhov and was about to cross the space between the barriers when dlokhov cried to your barrier and pierre grasping what was meant stopped by his saber only ten paces divided them dlokhov lowered his head to the snow greedily bit at it again raised his head adjusted himself drew in his legs and sat up seeking a firm center of gravity he sucked and swallowed the cold snow his lips quivered but his eyes still smiling glittered with effort and exasperation as he mustered his remaining strength he raised his pistol and aimed sideways cover yourself with your pistol ejaculated nesvtski cover yourself even densov cried to his adversary pierre with a gentle smile of pity and remorse his arms and legs helplessly spread out stood with his broad chest directly facing dlokhov and looked sorrowfully at him densov rostv and nesvtski closed their eyes at the same instant they heard a report and dlokhovs angry cry missed shouted dlokhov and he lay helplessly face downwards on the snow pierre clutched his temples and turning round went into the forest trampling through the deep snow and muttering incoherent words folly folly death lies he repeated puckering his face nesvtski stopped him and took him home rostv and densov drove away with the wounded dlokhov the latter lay silent in the sleigh with closed eyes and did not answer a word to the questions addressed to him but on entering moscow he suddenly came to and lifting his head with an effort took rostv who was sitting beside him by the hand rostv was struck by the totally altered and unexpectedly rapturous and tender expression on dlokhovs face well how do you feel he asked bad but its not that my friend said dlokhov with a gasping voice where are we in moscow i know i dont matter but i have killed her killed she wont get over it she wont survive who asked rostv my mother my mother my angel my adored angel mother and dlokhov pressed rostvs hand and burst into tears when he had become a little quieter he explained to rostv that he was living with his mother who if she saw him dying would not survive it he implored rostv to go on and prepare her rostv went on ahead to do what was asked and to his great surprise learned that dlokhov the
