a fair he pushed through evidently looking for someone natsha looked joyfully at the familiar face of pierre the buffoon as pernskaya had called him and knew he was looking for them and for her in particular he had promised to be at the ball and introduce partners to her but before he reached them pierre stopped beside a very handsome dark man of middle height and in a white uniform who stood by a window talking to a tall man wearing stars and a ribbon natsha at once recognized the shorter and younger man in the white uniform it was bolknski who seemed to her to have grown much younger happier and better-looking theres someone else we know bolknski do you see mamma said natsha pointing out prince andrew you remember he stayed a night with us at otrdnoe oh you know him said pernskaya i cant bear him il fait prsent la pluie et le beau temps hes too proud for anything takes after his father and hes hand in glove with spernski writing some project or other just look how he treats the ladies theres one talking to him and he has turned away she said pointing at him id give it to him if he treated me as he does those ladies he is all the rage just now chapter xvi suddenly everybody stirred began talking and pressed forward and then back and between the two rows which separated the emperor entered to the sounds of music that had immediately struck up behind him walked his host and hostess he walked in rapidly bowing to right and left as if anxious to get the first moments of the reception over the band played the polonaise in vogue at that time on account of the words that had been set to it beginning alexander elisaveta all our hearts you ravish quite the emperor passed on to the drawing room the crowd made a rush for the doors and several persons with excited faces hurried there and back again then the crowd hastily retired from the drawing room door at which the emperor reappeared talking to the hostess a young man looking distraught pounced down on the ladies asking them to move aside some ladies with faces betraying complete forgetfulness of all the rules of decorum pushed forward to the detriment of their toilets the men began to choose partners and take their places for the polonaise everyone moved back and the emperor came smiling out of the drawing room leading his hostess by the hand but not keeping time to the music the host followed with mrya antnovna narshkina then came ambassadors ministers and various generals whom pernskaya diligently named more than half the ladies already had partners and were taking up or preparing to take up their positions for the polonaise natsha felt that she would be left with her mother and snya among a minority of women who crowded near the wall not having been invited to dance she stood with her slender arms hanging down her scarcely defined bosom rising and falling regularly and with bated breath and glittering frightened eyes gazed straight before her evidently prepared for the height of joy or misery she was not concerned about the emperor or any of those great people whom pernskaya was pointing out she had but one thought is it possible no one will ask me that i shall not be among the first to dance is it possible that not one of all these men will notice me they do not even seem to see me or if they do they look as if they were saying ah shes not the one im after so its not worth looking at her no its impossible she thought they must know how i long to dance how splendidly i dance and how they would enjoy dancing with me the strains of the polonaise which had continued for a considerable time had begun to sound like a sad reminiscence to natshas ears she wanted to cry pernskaya had left them the count was at the other end of the room she and the countess and snya were standing by themselves as in the depths of a forest amid that crowd of strangers with no one interested in them and not wanted by anyone prince andrew with a lady passed by evidently not recognizing them the handsome anatole was smilingly talking to a partner on his arm and looked at natsha as one looks at a wall bors passed them
