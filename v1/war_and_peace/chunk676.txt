the man please step into the portrait gallery a few minutes later the footman returned with dessalles who brought word from the princess that she would be very glad to see pierre if he would excuse her want of ceremony and come upstairs to her apartment in a rather low room lit by one candle sat the princess and with her another person dressed in black pierre remembered that the princess always had lady companions but who they were and what they were like he never knew or remembered this must be one of her companions he thought glancing at the lady in the black dress the princess rose quickly to meet him and held out her hand yes she said looking at his altered face after he had kissed her hand so this is how we meet again he spoke of you even at the very last she went on turning her eyes from pierre to her companion with a shyness that surprised him for an instant i was so glad to hear of your safety it was the first piece of good news we had received for a long time again the princess glanced round at her companion with even more uneasiness in her manner and was about to add something but pierre interrupted her just imagine i knew nothing about him said he i thought he had been killed all i know i heard at second hand from others i only know that he fell in with the rostvs what a strange coincidence pierre spoke rapidly and with animation he glanced once at the companions face saw her attentive and kindly gaze fixed on him and as often happens when one is talking felt somehow that this companion in the black dress was a good kind excellent creature who would not hinder his conversing freely with princess mary but when he mentioned the rostvs princess marys face expressed still greater embarrassment she again glanced rapidly from pierres face to that of the lady in the black dress and said do you really not recognize her pierre looked again at the companions pale delicate face with its black eyes and peculiar mouth and something near to him long forgotten and more than sweet looked at him from those attentive eyes but no it cant be he thought this stern thin pale face that looks so much older it cannot be she it merely reminds me of her but at that moment princess mary said natsha and with difficulty effort and stress like the opening of a door grown rusty on its hinges a smile appeared on the face with the attentive eyes and from that opening door came a breath of fragrance which suffused pierre with a happiness he had long forgotten and of which he had not even been thinking especially at that moment it suffused him seized him and enveloped him completely when she smiled doubt was no longer possible it was natsha and he loved her at that moment pierre involuntarily betrayed to her to princess mary and above all to himself a secret of which he himself had been unaware he flushed joyfully yet with painful distress he tried to hide his agitation but the more he tried to hide it the more clearly clearer than any words could have done did he betray to himself to her and to princess mary that he loved her no its only the unexpectedness of it thought pierre but as soon as he tried to continue the conversation he had begun with princess mary he again glanced at natsha and a still-deeper flush suffused his face and a still-stronger agitation of mingled joy and fear seized his soul he became confused in his speech and stopped in the middle of what he was saying pierre had failed to notice natsha because he did not at all expect to see her there but he had failed to recognize her because the change in her since he last saw her was immense she had grown thin and pale but that was not what made her unrecognizable she was unrecognizable at the moment he entered because on that face whose eyes had always shone with a suppressed smile of the joy of life now when he first entered and glanced at her there was not the least shadow of a smile only her eyes were kindly attentive and sadly interrogative pierres confusion was not reflected by any confusion on natshas part but only by the pleasure that just perceptibly lit up her
