their chief on reaching the third company he suddenly stopped his suite not having expected this involuntarily came closer to him ah timkhin said he recognizing the red-nosed captain who had been reprimanded on account of the blue greatcoat one would have thought it impossible for a man to stretch himself more than timkhin had done when he was reprimanded by the regimental commander but now that the commander in chief addressed him he drew himself up to such an extent that it seemed he could not have sustained it had the commander in chief continued to look at him and so kutzov who evidently understood his case and wished him nothing but good quickly turned away a scarcely perceptible smile flitting over his scarred and puffy face another ismail comrade said he a brave officer are you satisfied with him he asked the regimental commander and the latter unconscious that he was being reflected in the hussar officer as in a looking glass started moved forward and answered highly satisfied your excellency we all have our weaknesses said kutzov smiling and walking away from him he used to have a predilection for bacchus the regimental commander was afraid he might be blamed for this and did not answer the hussar at that moment noticed the face of the red-nosed captain and his drawn-in stomach and mimicked his expression and pose with such exactitude that nesvtski could not help laughing kutzov turned round the officer evidently had complete control of his face and while kutzov was turning managed to make a grimace and then assume a most serious deferential and innocent expression the third company was the last and kutzov pondered apparently trying to recollect something prince andrew stepped forward from among the suite and said in french you told me to remind you of the officer dlokhov reduced to the ranks in this regiment where is dlokhov asked kutzov dlokhov who had already changed into a soldiers gray greatcoat did not wait to be called the shapely figure of the fair-haired soldier with his clear blue eyes stepped forward from the ranks went up to the commander in chief and presented arms have you a complaint to make kutzov asked with a slight frown this is dlokhov said prince andrew ah said kutzov i hope this will be a lesson to you do your duty the emperor is gracious and i shant forget you if you deserve well the clear blue eyes looked at the commander in chief just as boldly as they had looked at the regimental commander seeming by their expression to tear open the veil of convention that separates a commander in chief so widely from a private one thing i ask of your excellency dlokhov said in his firm ringing deliberate voice i ask an opportunity to atone for my fault and prove my devotion to his majesty the emperor and to russia kutzov turned away the same smile of the eyes with which he had turned from captain timkhin again flitted over his face he turned away with a grimace as if to say that everything dlokhov had said to him and everything he could say had long been known to him that he was weary of it and it was not at all what he wanted he turned away and went to the carriage the regiment broke up into companies which went to their appointed quarters near braunau where they hoped to receive boots and clothes and to rest after their hard marches you wont bear me a grudge prokhr igntych said the regimental commander overtaking the third company on its way to its quarters and riding up to captain timkhin who was walking in front the regimental commanders face now that the inspection was happily over beamed with irrepressible delight its in the emperors service it cant be helped one is sometimes a bit hasty on parade i am the first to apologize you know me he was very pleased and he held out his hand to the captain dont mention it general as if id be so bold replied the captain his nose growing redder as he gave a smile which showed where two front teeth were missing that had been knocked out by the butt end of a gun at ismail and tell mr dlokhov that i wont forget him he may be quite easy and tell me please ive been meaning to ask how is he behaving himself and in general as far as the service goes he is quite punctilious your
