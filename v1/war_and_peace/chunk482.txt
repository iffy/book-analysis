and rode along the hollow with the adjutant to ravskis redoubt his horse lagged behind the adjutants and jolted him at every step you dont seem to be used to riding count remarked the adjutant no its not that but her action seems so jerky said pierre in a puzzled tone why shes wounded said the adjutant in the off foreleg above the knee a bullet no doubt i congratulate you count on your baptism of fire having ridden in the smoke past the sixth corps behind the artillery which had been moved forward and was in action deafening them with the noise of firing they came to a small wood there it was cool and quiet with a scent of autumn pierre and the adjutant dismounted and walked up the hill on foot is the general here asked the adjutant on reaching the knoll he was here a minute ago but has just gone that way someone told him pointing to the right the adjutant looked at pierre as if puzzled what to do with him now dont trouble about me said pierre ill go up onto the knoll if i may yes do youll see everything from there and its less dangerous and ill come for you pierre went to the battery and the adjutant rode on they did not meet again and only much later did pierre learn that he lost an arm that day the knoll to which pierre ascended was that famous one afterwards known to the russians as the knoll battery or ravskis redoubt and to the french as la grande redoute la fatale redoute la redoute du centre around which tens of thousands fell and which the french regarded as the key to the whole position this redoubt consisted of a knoll on three sides of which trenches had been dug within the entrenchment stood ten guns that were being fired through openings in the earthwork in line with the knoll on both sides stood other guns which also fired incessantly a little behind the guns stood infantry when ascending that knoll pierre had no notion that this spot on which small trenches had been dug and from which a few guns were firing was the most important point of the battle on the contrary just because he happened to be there he thought it one of the least significant parts of the field having reached the knoll pierre sat down at one end of a trench surrounding the battery and gazed at what was going on around him with an unconsciously happy smile occasionally he rose and walked about the battery still with that same smile trying not to obstruct the soldiers who were loading hauling the guns and continually running past him with bags and charges the guns of that battery were being fired continually one after another with a deafening roar enveloping the whole neighborhood in powder smoke in contrast with the dread felt by the infantrymen placed in support here in the battery where a small number of men busy at their work were separated from the rest by a trench everyone experienced a common and as it were family feeling of animation the intrusion of pierres nonmilitary figure in a white hat made an unpleasant impression at first the soldiers looked askance at him with surprise and even alarm as they went past him the senior artillery officer a tall long-legged pockmarked man moved over to pierre as if to see the action of the farthest gun and looked at him with curiosity a young round-faced officer quite a boy still and evidently only just out of the cadet college who was zealously commanding the two guns entrusted to him addressed pierre sternly sir he said permit me to ask you to stand aside you must not be here the soldiers shook their heads disapprovingly as they looked at pierre but when they had convinced themselves that this man in the white hat was doing no harm but either sat quietly on the slope of the trench with a shy smile or politely making way for the soldiers paced up and down the battery under fire as calmly as if he were on a boulevard their feeling of hostile distrust gradually began to change into a kindly and bantering sympathy such as soldiers feel for their dogs cocks goats and in general for the animals that live with the regiment the men soon accepted pierre into their family adopted him gave him a nickname our gentleman and made kindly fun
