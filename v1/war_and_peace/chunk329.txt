bolknski listened as a presiding judge receives a report only now and then silently or by a brief word showing that he took heed of what was being reported to him the tone of the conversation was such as indicated that no one approved of what was being done in the political world incidents were related evidently confirming the opinion that everything was going from bad to worse but whether telling a story or giving an opinion the speaker always stopped or was stopped at the point beyond which his criticism might touch the sovereign himself at dinner the talk turned on the latest political news napoleons seizure of the duke of oldenburgs territory and the russian note hostile to napoleon which had been sent to all the european courts bonaparte treats europe as a pirate does a captured vessel said count rostopchn repeating a phrase he had uttered several times before one only wonders at the long-suffering or blindness of the crowned heads now the popes turn has come and bonaparte doesnt scruple to depose the head of the catholic church yet all keep silent our sovereign alone has protested against the seizure of the duke of oldenburgs territory and even count rostopchn paused feeling that he had reached the limit beyond which censure was impossible other territories have been offered in exchange for the duchy of oldenburg said prince bolknski he shifts the dukes about as i might move my serfs from bald hills to boguchrovo or my ryazn estates the duke of oldenburg bears his misfortunes with admirable strength of character and resignation remarked bors joining in respectfully he said this because on his journey from petersburg he had had the honor of being presented to the duke prince bolknski glanced at the young man as if about to say something in reply but changed his mind evidently considering him too young i have read our protests about the oldenburg affair and was surprised how badly the note was worded remarked count rostopchn in the casual tone of a man dealing with a subject quite familiar to him pierre looked at rostopchn with nave astonishment not understanding why he should be disturbed by the bad composition of the note does it matter count how the note is worded he asked so long as its substance is forcible my dear fellow with our five hundred thousand troops it should be easy to have a good style returned count rostopchn pierre now understood the counts dissatisfaction with the wording of the note one would have thought quill drivers enough had sprung up remarked the old prince there in petersburg they are always writing not notes only but even new laws my andrew there has written a whole volume of laws for russia nowadays they are always writing and he laughed unnaturally there was a momentary pause in the conversation the old general cleared his throat to draw attention did you hear of the last event at the review in petersburg the figure cut by the new french ambassador eh yes i heard something he said something awkward in his majestys presence his majesty drew attention to the grenadier division and to the march past continued the general and it seems the ambassador took no notice and allowed himself to reply that we in france pay no attention to such trifles the emperor did not condescend to reply at the next review they say the emperor did not once deign to address him all were silent on this fact relating to the emperor personally it was impossible to pass any judgment impudent fellows said the prince you know mtivier i turned him out of my house this morning he was here they admitted him in spite of my request that they should let no one in he went on glancing angrily at his daughter and he narrated his whole conversation with the french doctor and the reasons that convinced him that mtivier was a spy though these reasons were very insufficient and obscure no one made any rejoinder after the roast champagne was served the guests rose to congratulate the old prince princess mary too went round to him he gave her a cold angry look and offered her his wrinkled clean-shaven cheek to kiss the whole expression of his face told her that he had not forgotten the mornings talk that his decision remained in force and only the presence of visitors hindered his speaking of it to her now when they went into the drawing room where coffee was served
