on the one side a demonstration made by the russians with uvrovs cavalry at midday and on the other side beyond uttsa poniatowskis collision with tchkov but these two were detached and feeble actions in comparison with what took place in the center of the battlefield on the field between borodin and the flches beside the wood the chief action of the day took place on an open space visible from both sides and was fought in the simplest and most artless way the battle began on both sides with a cannonade from several hundred guns then when the whole field was covered with smoke two divisions campans and dessaixs advanced from the french right while murats troops advanced on borodin from their left from the shevrdino redoubt where napoleon was standing the flches were two thirds of a mile away and it was more than a mile as the crow flies to borodin so that napoleon could not see what was happening there especially as the smoke mingling with the mist hid the whole locality the soldiers of dessaixs division advancing against the flches could only be seen till they had entered the hollow that lay between them and the flches as soon as they had descended into that hollow the smoke of the guns and musketry on the flches grew so dense that it covered the whole approach on that side of it through the smoke glimpses could be caught of something black probably men and at times the glint of bayonets but whether they were moving or stationary whether they were french or russian could not be discovered from the shevrdino redoubt the sun had risen brightly and its slanting rays struck straight into napoleons face as shading his eyes with his hand he looked at the flches the smoke spread out before them and at times it looked as if the smoke were moving at times as if the troops moved sometimes shouts were heard through the firing but it was impossible to tell what was being done there napoleon standing on the knoll looked through a field glass and in its small circlet saw smoke and men sometimes his own and sometimes russians but when he looked again with the naked eye he could not tell where what he had seen was he descended the knoll and began walking up and down before it occasionally he stopped listened to the firing and gazed intently at the battlefield but not only was it impossible to make out what was happening from where he was standing down below or from the knoll above on which some of his generals had taken their stand but even from the flches themselves in which by this time there were now russian and now french soldiers alternately or together dead wounded alive frightened or maddened even at those flches themselves it was impossible to make out what was taking place there for several hours amid incessant cannon and musketry fire now russians were seen alone now frenchmen alone now infantry and now cavalry they appeared fired fell collided not knowing what to do with one another screamed and ran back again from the battlefield adjutants he had sent out and orderlies from his marshals kept galloping up to napoleon with reports of the progress of the action but all these reports were false both because it was impossible in the heat of battle to say what was happening at any given moment and because many of the adjutants did not go to the actual place of conflict but reported what they had heard from others and also because while an adjutant was riding more than a mile to napoleon circumstances changed and the news he brought was already becoming false thus an adjutant galloped up from murat with tidings that borodin had been occupied and the bridge over the koloch was in the hands of the french the adjutant asked whether napoleon wished the troops to cross it napoleon gave orders that the troops should form up on the farther side and wait but before that order was given almost as soon in fact as the adjutant had left borodin the bridge had been retaken by the russians and burned in the very skirmish at which pierre had been present at the beginning of the battle an adjutant galloped up from the flches with a pale and frightened face and reported to napoleon that their attack had been repulsed campan wounded and davout killed yet at the very time the adjutant had been
