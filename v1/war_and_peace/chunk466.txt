that everything was done by bennigsen in any case many great rewards would have to be given for tomorrows action and new men would come to the front so bors was full of nervous vivacity all day after kaysrov others whom pierre knew came up to him and he had not time to reply to all the questions about moscow that were showered upon him or to listen to all that was told him the faces all expressed animation and apprehension but it seemed to pierre that the cause of the excitement shown in some of these faces lay chiefly in questions of personal success his mind however was occupied by the different expression he saw on other faces an expression that spoke not of personal matters but of the universal questions of life and death kutzov noticed pierres figure and the group gathered round him call him to me said kutzov an adjutant told pierre of his serene highness wish and pierre went toward kutzovs bench but a militiaman got there before him it was dlokhov how did that fellow get here asked pierre hes a creature that wriggles in anywhere was the answer he has been degraded you know now he wants to bob up again hes been proposing some scheme or other and has crawled into the enemys picket line at night hes a brave fellow pierre took off his hat and bowed respectfully to kutzov i concluded that if i reported to your serene highness you might send me away or say that you knew what i was reporting but then i shouldnt lose anything dlokhov was saying yes yes but if i were right i should be rendering a service to my fatherland for which i am ready to die yes yes and should your serene highness require a man who will not spare his skin please think of me perhaps i may prove useful to your serene highness yes yes kutzov repeated his laughing eye narrowing more and more as he looked at pierre just then bors with his courtierlike adroitness stepped up to pierres side near kutzov and in a most natural manner without raising his voice said to pierre as though continuing an interrupted conversation the militia have put on clean white shirts to be ready to die what heroism count bors evidently said this to pierre in order to be overheard by his serene highness he knew kutzovs attention would be caught by those words and so it was what are you saying about the militia he asked bors preparing for tomorrow your serene highness for death they have put on clean shirts ah a wonderful a matchless people said kutzov and he closed his eyes and swayed his head a matchless people he repeated with a sigh so you want to smell gunpowder he said to pierre yes its a pleasant smell i have the honor to be one of your wifes adorers is she well my quarters are at your service and as often happens with old people kutzov began looking about absent-mindedly as if forgetting all he wanted to say or do then evidently remembering what he wanted he beckoned to andrew kaysrov his adjutants brother those verses those verses of mrins how do they go eh those he wrote about gerkov lectures for the corps inditing recite them recite them said he evidently preparing to laugh kaysrov recited kutzov smilingly nodded his head to the rhythm of the verses when pierre had left kutzov dlokhov came up to him and took his hand i am very glad to meet you here count he said aloud regardless of the presence of strangers and in a particularly resolute and solemn tone on the eve of a day when god alone knows who of us is fated to survive i am glad of this opportunity to tell you that i regret the misunderstandings that occurred between us and should wish you not to have any ill feeling for me i beg you to forgive me pierre looked at dlokhov with a smile not knowing what to say to him with tears in his eyes dlokhov embraced pierre and kissed him bors said a few words to his general and count bennigsen turned to pierre and proposed that he should ride with him along the line it will interest you said he yes very much replied pierre half an hour later kutzov left for tatrinova and bennigsen and his suite with pierre among them set out on their ride along the line chapter
