accountant a stout full-faced man looked around him with a nave smile of satisfaction and presented a strange appearance among the hussars cossacks and adjutants in his camlet coat as he jolted on his horse with a convoy officers saddle he wants to see a battle said zherkv to bolknski pointing to the accountant but he feels a pain in the pit of his stomach already oh leave off said the accountant with a beaming but rather cunning smile as if flattered at being made the subject of zherkvs joke and purposely trying to appear stupider than he really was it is very strange mon monsieur prince said the staff officer he remembered that in french there is some peculiar way of addressing a prince but could not get it quite right by this time they were all approaching tshins battery and a ball struck the ground in front of them whats that that has fallen asked the accountant with a nave smile a french pancake answered zherkv so thats what they hit with asked the accountant how awful he seemed to swell with satisfaction he had hardly finished speaking when they again heard an unexpectedly violent whistling which suddenly ended with a thud into something soft f-f-flop and a cossack riding a little to their right and behind the accountant crashed to earth with his horse zherkv and the staff officer bent over their saddles and turned their horses away the accountant stopped facing the cossack and examined him with attentive curiosity the cossack was dead but the horse still struggled prince bagratin screwed up his eyes looked round and seeing the cause of the confusion turned away with indifference as if to say is it worth while noticing trifles he reined in his horse with the care of a skillful rider and slightly bending over disengaged his saber which had caught in his cloak it was an old-fashioned saber of a kind no longer in general use prince andrew remembered the story of suvrov giving his saber to bagratin in italy and the recollection was particularly pleasant at that moment they had reached the battery at which prince andrew had been when he examined the battlefield whose company asked prince bagratin of an artilleryman standing by the ammunition wagon he asked whose company but he really meant are you frightened here and the artilleryman understood him captain tshins your excellency shouted the red-haired freckled gunner in a merry voice standing to attention yes yes muttered bagratin as if considering something and he rode past the limbers to the farthest cannon as he approached a ringing shot issued from it deafening him and his suite and in the smoke that suddenly surrounded the gun they could see the gunners who had seized it straining to roll it quickly back to its former position a huge broad-shouldered gunner number one holding a mop his legs far apart sprang to the wheel while number two with a trembling hand placed a charge in the cannons mouth the short round-shouldered captain tshin stumbling over the tail of the gun carriage moved forward and not noticing the general looked out shading his eyes with his small hand lift it two lines more and it will be just right cried he in a feeble voice to which he tried to impart a dashing note ill-suited to his weak figure number two he squeaked fire medvdev bagratin called to him and tshin raising three fingers to his cap with a bashful and awkward gesture not at all like a military salute but like a priests benediction approached the general though tshins guns had been intended to cannonade the valley he was firing incendiary balls at the village of schn grabern visible just opposite in front of which large masses of french were advancing no one had given tshin orders where and at what to fire but after consulting his sergeant major zakharchnko for whom he had great respect he had decided that it would be a good thing to set fire to the village very good said bagratin in reply to the officers report and began deliberately to examine the whole battlefield extended before him the french had advanced nearest on our right below the height on which the kiev regiment was stationed in the hollow where the rivulet flowed the soul-stirring rolling and crackling of musketry was heard and much farther to the right beyond the dragoons the officer of the suite pointed out to bagratin a french column that was outflanking us to the left
