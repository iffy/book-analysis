come on rugy heres a pad for you he said throwing down the hares muddy pad youve deserved it thats it come on shed tired herself out shed run it down three times by herself said nicholas also not listening to anyone and regardless of whether he were heard or not but what is there in running across it like that said ilgins groom once she had missed it and turned it away any mongrel could take it ilgin was saying at the same time breathless from his gallop and his excitement at the same moment natsha without drawing breath screamed joyously ecstatically and so piercingly that it set everyones ear tingling by that shriek she expressed what the others expressed by all talking at once and it was so strange that she must herself have been ashamed of so wild a cry and everyone else would have been amazed at it at any other time uncle himself twisted up the hare threw it neatly and smartly across his horses back as if by that gesture he meant to rebuke everybody and with an air of not wishing to speak to anyone mounted his bay and rode off the others all followed dispirited and shamefaced and only much later were they able to regain their former affectation of indifference for a long time they continued to look at red rugy who his arched back spattered with mud and clanking the ring of his leash walked along just behind uncles horse with the serene air of a conqueror well i am like any other dog as long as its not a question of coursing but when it is then look out his appearance seemed to nicholas to be saying when much later uncle rode up to nicholas and began talking to him he felt flattered that after what had happened uncle deigned to speak to him chapter vii toward evening ilgin took leave of nicholas who found that they were so far from home that he accepted uncles offer that the hunting party should spend the night in his little village of mikhylovna and if you put up at my house that will be better still thats it come on said uncle you see its damp weather and you could rest and the little countess could be driven home in a trap uncles offer was accepted a huntsman was sent to otrdnoe for a trap while nicholas rode with natsha and ptya to uncles house some five male domestic serfs big and little rushed out to the front porch to meet their master a score of women serfs old and young as well as children popped out from the back entrance to have a look at the hunters who were arriving the presence of natsha a woman a lady and on horseback raised the curiosity of the serfs to such a degree that many of them came up to her stared her in the face and unabashed by her presence made remarks about her as though she were some prodigy on show and not a human being able to hear or understand what was said about her arnka look she sits sideways there she sits and her skirt dangles see shes got a little hunting horn goodness gracious see her knife isnt she a tartar how is it you didnt go head over heels asked the boldest of all addressing natsha directly uncle dismounted at the porch of his little wooden house which stood in the midst of an overgrown garden and after a glance at his retainers shouted authoritatively that the superfluous ones should take themselves off and that all necessary preparations should be made to receive the guests and the visitors the serfs all dispersed uncle lifted natsha off her horse and taking her hand led her up the rickety wooden steps of the porch the house with its bare unplastered log walls was not overclean it did not seem that those living in it aimed at keeping it spotless but neither was it noticeably neglected in the entry there was a smell of fresh apples and wolf and fox skins hung about uncle led the visitors through the anteroom into a small hall with a folding table and red chairs then into the drawing room with a round birchwood table and a sofa and finally into his private room where there was a tattered sofa a worn carpet and portraits of suvrov of the hosts father and mother and of himself in military uniform the study smelt strongly of tobacco
