ease contrasting with the heavy tread of the soldiers who were keeping step with him he carried close to his leg a narrow unsheathed sword small curved and not like a real weapon and looked now at the superior officers and now back at the men without losing step his whole powerful body turning flexibly it was as if all the powers of his soul were concentrated on passing the commander in the best possible manner and feeling that he was doing it well he was happy left left left he seemed to repeat to himself at each alternate step and in time to this with stern but varied faces the wall of soldiers burdened with knapsacks and muskets marched in step and each one of these hundreds of soldiers seemed to be repeating to himself at each alternate step left left left a fat major skirted a bush puffing and falling out of step a soldier who had fallen behind his face showing alarm at his defection ran at a trot panting to catch up with his company a cannon ball cleaving the air flew over the heads of bagratin and his suite and fell into the column to the measure of left left close up came the company commanders voice in jaunty tones the soldiers passed in a semicircle round something where the ball had fallen and an old trooper on the flank a noncommissioned officer who had stopped beside the dead men ran to catch up his line and falling into step with a hop looked back angrily and through the ominous silence and the regular tramp of feet beating the ground in unison one seemed to hear left left left well done lads said prince bagratin glad to do our best your exlen-lency came a confused shout from the ranks a morose soldier marching on the left turned his eyes on bagratin as he shouted with an expression that seemed to say we know that ourselves another without looking round as though fearing to relax shouted with his mouth wide open and passed on the order was given to halt and down knapsacks bagratin rode round the ranks that had marched past him and dismounted he gave the reins to a cossack took off and handed over his felt coat stretched his legs and set his cap straight the head of the french column with its officers leading appeared from below the hill forward with god said bagratin in a resolute sonorous voice turning for a moment to the front line and slightly swinging his arms he went forward uneasily over the rough field with the awkward gait of a cavalryman prince andrew felt that an invisible power was leading him forward and experienced great happiness the french were already near prince andrew walking beside bagratin could clearly distinguish their bandoliers red epaulets and even their faces he distinctly saw an old french officer who with gaitered legs and turned-out toes climbed the hill with difficulty prince bagratin gave no further orders and silently continued to walk on in front of the ranks suddenly one shot after another rang out from the french smoke appeared all along their uneven ranks and musket shots sounded several of our men fell among them the round-faced officer who had marched so gaily and complacently but at the moment the first report was heard bagratin looked round and shouted hurrah hurrah ah ah rang a long-drawn shout from our ranks and passing bagratin and racing one another they rushed in an irregular but joyous and eager crowd down the hill at their disordered foe chapter xix the attack of the sixth chasseurs secured the retreat of our right flank in the center tshins forgotten battery which had managed to set fire to the schn grabern village delayed the french advance the french were putting out the fire which the wind was spreading and thus gave us time to retreat the retirement of the center to the other side of the dip in the ground at the rear was hurried and noisy but the different companies did not get mixed but our left which consisted of the azv and podlsk infantry and the pvlograd hussars was simultaneously attacked and outflanked by superior french forces under lannes and was thrown into confusion bagratin had sent zherkv to the general commanding that left flank with orders to retreat immediately zherkv not removing his hand from his cap turned his horse about and galloped off but no sooner had he left bagratin than his courage failed
