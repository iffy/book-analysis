was covered with a pink quilt and that his eyes were closed yes yes it really was pink cried natsha who now thought she too remembered the word pink being used and saw in this the most extraordinary and mysterious part of the prediction but what does it mean she added meditatively oh i dont know it is all so strange replied snya clutching at her head a few minutes later prince andrew rang and natsha went to him but snya feeling unusually excited and touched remained at the window thinking about the strangeness of what had occurred they had an opportunity that day to send letters to the army and the countess was writing to her son snya said the countess raising her eyes from her letter as her niece passed snya wont you write to nicholas she spoke in a soft tremulous voice and in the weary eyes that looked over her spectacles snya read all that the countess meant to convey with these words those eyes expressed entreaty shame at having to ask fear of a refusal and readiness for relentless hatred in case of such refusal snya went up to the countess and kneeling down kissed her hand yes mamma i will write said she snya was softened excited and touched by all that had occurred that day especially by the mysterious fulfillment she had just seen of her vision now that she knew that the renewal of natshas relations with prince andrew would prevent nicholas from marrying princess mary she was joyfully conscious of a return of that self-sacrificing spirit in which she was accustomed to live and loved to live so with a joyful consciousness of performing a magnanimous deed interrupted several times by the tears that dimmed her velvety black eyes she wrote that touching letter the arrival of which had so amazed nicholas chapter ix the officer and soldiers who had arrested pierre treated him with hostility but yet with respect in the guardhouse to which he was taken in their attitude toward him could still be felt both uncertainty as to who he might be perhaps a very important person and hostility as a result of their recent personal conflict with him but when the guard was relieved next morning pierre felt that for the new guard both officers and men he was not as interesting as he had been to his captors and in fact the guard of the second day did not recognize in this big stout man in a peasant coat the vigorous person who had fought so desperately with the marauder and the convoy and had uttered those solemn words about saving a child they saw in him only no of the captured russians arrested and detained for some reason by order of the higher command if they noticed anything remarkable about pierre it was only his unabashed meditative concentration and thoughtfulness and the way he spoke french which struck them as surprisingly good in spite of this he was placed that day with the other arrested suspects as the separate room he had occupied was required by an officer all the russians confined with pierre were men of the lowest class and recognizing him as a gentleman they all avoided him more especially as he spoke french pierre felt sad at hearing them making fun of him that evening he learned that all these prisoners he probably among them were to be tried for incendiarism on the third day he was taken with the others to a house where a french general with a white mustache sat with two colonels and other frenchmen with scarves on their arms with the precision and definiteness customary in addressing prisoners and which is supposed to preclude human frailty pierre like the others was questioned as to who he was where he had been with what object and so on these questions like questions put at trials generally left the essence of the matter aside shut out the possibility of that essences being revealed and were designed only to form a channel through which the judges wished the answers of the accused to flow so as to lead to the desired result namely a conviction as soon as pierre began to say anything that did not fit in with that aim the channel was removed and the water could flow to waste pierre felt moreover what the accused always feel at their trial perplexity as to why these questions were put to him he had a feeling that it was only out
