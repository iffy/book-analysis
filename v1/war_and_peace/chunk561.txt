of the very natsha of whom he had just been thinking oh how oppressive this continual delirium is thought prince andrew trying to drive that face from his imagination but the face remained before him with the force of reality and drew nearer prince andrew wished to return to that former world of pure thought but he could not and delirium drew him back into its domain the soft whispering voice continued its rhythmic murmur something oppressed him and stretched out and the strange face was before him prince andrew collected all his strength in an effort to recover his senses he moved a little and suddenly there was a ringing in his ears a dimness in his eyes and like a man plunged into water he lost consciousness when he came to himself natsha that same living natsha whom of all people he most longed to love with this new pure divine love that had been revealed to him was kneeling before him he realized that it was the real living natsha and he was not surprised but quietly happy natsha motionless on her knees she was unable to stir with frightened eyes riveted on him was restraining her sobs her face was pale and rigid only in the lower part of it something quivered prince andrew sighed with relief smiled and held out his hand you he said how fortunate with a rapid but careful movement natsha drew nearer to him on her knees and taking his hand carefully bent her face over it and began kissing it just touching it lightly with her lips forgive me she whispered raising her head and glancing at him forgive me i love you said prince andrew forgive forgive what he asked forgive me for what i ha-ve do-ne faltered natsha in a scarcely audible broken whisper and began kissing his hand more rapidly just touching it with her lips i love you more better than before said prince andrew lifting her face with his hand so as to look into her eyes those eyes filled with happy tears gazed at him timidly compassionately and with joyous love natshas thin pale face with its swollen lips was more than plain it was dreadful but prince andrew did not see that he saw her shining eyes which were beautiful they heard the sound of voices behind them peter the valet who was now wide awake had roused the doctor timkhin who had not slept at all because of the pain in his leg had long been watching all that was going on carefully covering his bare body with the sheet as he huddled up on his bench whats this said the doctor rising from his bed please go away madam at that moment a maid sent by the countess who had noticed her daughters absence knocked at the door like a somnambulist aroused from her sleep natsha went out of the room and returning to her hut fell sobbing on her bed from that time during all the rest of the rostvs journey at every halting place and wherever they spent a night natsha never left the wounded bolknski and the doctor had to admit that he had not expected from a young girl either such firmness or such skill in nursing a wounded man dreadful as the countess imagined it would be should prince andrew die in her daughters arms during the journey as judging by what the doctor said it seemed might easily happen she could not oppose natsha though with the intimacy now established between the wounded man and natsha the thought occurred that should he recover their former engagement would be renewed no one least of all natsha and prince andrew spoke of this the unsettled question of life and death which hung not only over bolknski but over all russia shut out all other considerations chapter xxxiii on the third of september pierre awoke late his head was aching the clothes in which he had slept without undressing felt uncomfortable on his body and his mind had a dim consciousness of something shameful he had done the day before that something shameful was his yesterdays conversation with captain ramballe it was eleven by the clock but it seemed peculiarly dark out of doors pierre rose rubbed his eyes and seeing the pistol with an engraved stock which gersim had replaced on the writing table he remembered where he was and what lay before him that very day am i not too late he thought no probably he wont make
