whole course of life is altered and presents an intensive movement which first increases and then slackens what was the cause of this movement by what laws was it governed asks the mind of man the historians replying to this question lay before us the sayings and doings of a few dozen men in a building in the city of paris calling these sayings and doings the revolution then they give a detailed biography of napoleon and of certain people favorable or hostile to him tell of the influence some of these people had on others and say that is why this movement took place and those are its laws but the mind of man not only refuses to believe this explanation but plainly says that this method of explanation is fallacious because in it a weaker phenomenon is taken as the cause of a stronger the sum of human wills produced the revolution and napoleon and only the sum of those wills first tolerated and then destroyed them but every time there have been conquests there have been conquerors every time there has been a revolution in any state there have been great men says history and indeed human reason replies every time conquerors appear there have been wars but this does not prove that the conquerors caused the wars and that it is possible to find the laws of a war in the personal activity of a single man whenever i look at my watch and its hands point to ten i hear the bells of the neighboring church but because the bells begin to ring when the hands of the clock reach ten i have no right to assume that the movement of the bells is caused by the position of the hands of the watch whenever i see the movement of a locomotive i hear the whistle and see the valves opening and wheels turning but i have no right to conclude that the whistling and the turning of wheels are the cause of the movement of the engine the peasants say that a cold wind blows in late spring because the oaks are budding and really every spring cold winds do blow when the oak is budding but though i do not know what causes the cold winds to blow when the oak buds unfold i cannot agree with the peasants that the unfolding of the oak buds is the cause of the cold wind for the force of the wind is beyond the influence of the buds i see only a coincidence of occurrences such as happens with all the phenomena of life and i see that however much and however carefully i observe the hands of the watch and the valves and wheels of the engine and the oak i shall not discover the cause of the bells ringing the engine moving or of the winds of spring to that i must entirely change my point of view and study the laws of the movement of steam of the bells and of the wind history must do the same and attempts in this direction have already been made to study the laws of history we must completely change the subject of our observation must leave aside kings ministers and generals and study the common infinitesimally small elements by which the masses are moved no one can say in how far it is possible for man to advance in this way toward an understanding of the laws of history but it is evident that only along that path does the possibility of discovering the laws of history lie and that as yet not a millionth part as much mental effort has been applied in this direction by historians as has been devoted to describing the actions of various kings commanders and ministers and propounding the historians own reflections concerning these actions chapter ii the forces of a dozen european nations burst into russia the russian army and people avoided a collision till smolnsk was reached and again from smolnsk to borodin the french army pushed on to moscow its goal its impetus ever increasing as it neared its aim just as the velocity of a falling body increases as it approaches the earth behind it were seven hundred miles of hunger-stricken hostile country ahead were a few dozen miles separating it from its goal every soldier in napoleons army felt this and the invasion moved on by its own momentum the more the russian army retreated the more fiercely a spirit of hatred of the enemy
