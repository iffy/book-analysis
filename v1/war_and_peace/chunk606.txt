clear and obvious to him that the sergeant was an impostor that he had lied and that the whole russian attack would be ruined by the absence of those two regiments which he would lead away heaven only knew where how could one capture a commander in chief from among such a mass of troops i am sure that rascal was lying said the count they can still be called back said one of his suite who like count orlv felt distrustful of the adventure when he looked at the enemys camp eh really what do you think should we let them go on or not will you have them fetched back fetch them back fetch them back said count orlv with sudden determination looking at his watch it will be too late it is quite light and the adjutant galloped through the forest after grkov when grkov returned count orlv-densov excited both by the abandoned attempt and by vainly awaiting the infantry columns that still did not appear as well as by the proximity of the enemy resolved to advance all his men felt the same excitement mount he commanded in a whisper the men took their places and crossed themselves forward with gods aid hurrah-ah-ah reverberated in the forest and the cossack companies trailing their lances and advancing one after another as if poured out of a sack dashed gaily across the brook toward the camp one desperate frightened yell from the first french soldier who saw the cossacks and all who were in the camp undressed and only just waking up ran off in all directions abandoning cannons muskets and horses had the cossacks pursued the french without heeding what was behind and around them they would have captured murat and everything there that was what the officers desired but it was impossible to make the cossacks budge when once they had got booty and prisoners none of them listened to orders fifteen hundred prisoners and thirty-eight guns were taken on the spot besides standards and what seemed most important to the cossacks horses saddles horsecloths and the like all this had to be dealt with the prisoners and guns secured the booty divided not without some shouting and even a little fighting among themselves and it was on this that the cossacks all busied themselves the french not being farther pursued began to recover themselves they formed into detachments and began firing orlv-densov still waiting for the other columns to arrive advanced no further meantime according to the dispositions which said that the first column will march and so on the infantry of the belated columns commanded by bennigsen and directed by toll had started in due order and as always happens had got somewhere but not to their appointed places as always happens the men starting cheerfully began to halt murmurs were heard there was a sense of confusion and finally a backward movement adjutants and generals galloped about shouted grew angry quarreled said they had come quite wrong and were late gave vent to a little abuse and at last gave it all up and went forward simply to get somewhere we shall get somewhere or other and they did indeed get somewhere though not to their right places a few eventually even got to their right place but too late to be of any use and only in time to be fired at toll who in this battle played the part of weyrother at austerlitz galloped assiduously from place to place finding everything upside down everywhere thus he stumbled on bagovts corps in a wood when it was already broad daylight though the corps should long before have joined orlv-densov excited and vexed by the failure and supposing that someone must be responsible for it toll galloped up to the commander of the corps and began upbraiding him severely saying that he ought to be shot general bagovt a fighting old soldier of placid temperament being also upset by all the delay confusion and cross-purposes fell into a rage to everybodys surprise and quite contrary to his usual character and said disagreeable things to toll i prefer not to take lessons from anyone but i can die with my men as well as anybody he said and advanced with a single division coming out onto a field under the enemys fire this brave general went straight ahead leading his men under fire without considering in his agitation whether going into action now with a single division would be of any use or no danger cannon
