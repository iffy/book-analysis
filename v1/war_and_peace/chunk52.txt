despicable part in this affair and that he returned to petersburg quite crestfallen i confess i understand very little about all these matters of wills and inheritance but i do know that since this young man whom we all used to know as plain monsieur pierre has become count bezkhov and the owner of one of the largest fortunes in russia i am much amused to watch the change in the tone and manners of the mammas burdened by marriageable daughters and of the young ladies themselves toward him though between you and me he always seemed to me a poor sort of fellow as for the past two years people have amused themselves by finding husbands for me most of whom i dont even know the matchmaking chronicles of moscow now speak of me as the future countess bezkhova but you will understand that i have no desire for the post propos of marriages do you know that a while ago that universal auntie anna mikhylovna told me under the seal of strict secrecy of a plan of marriage for you it is neither more nor less than with prince vaslis son anatole whom they wish to reform by marrying him to someone rich and distingue and it is on you that his relations choice has fallen i dont know what you will think of it but i consider it my duty to let you know of it he is said to be very handsome and a terrible scapegrace that is all i have been able to find out about him but enough of gossip i am at the end of my second sheet of paper and mamma has sent for me to go and dine at the aprksins read the mystical book i am sending you it has an enormous success here though there are things in it difficult for the feeble human mind to grasp it is an admirable book which calms and elevates the soul adieu give my respects to monsieur your father and my compliments to mademoiselle bourienne i embrace you as i love you julie ps let me have news of your brother and his charming little wife the princess pondered awhile with a thoughtful smile and her luminous eyes lit up so that her face was entirely transformed then she suddenly rose and with her heavy tread went up to the table she took a sheet of paper and her hand moved rapidly over it this is the reply she wrote also in french dear and precious friend your letter of the th has given me great delight so you still love me my romantic julie separation of which you say so much that is bad does not seem to have had its usual effect on you you complain of our separation what then should i say if i dared complain i who am deprived of all who are dear to me ah if we had not religion to console us life would be very sad why do you suppose that i should look severely on your affection for that young man on such matters i am only severe with myself i understand such feelings in others and if never having felt them i cannot approve of them neither do i condemn them only it seems to me that christian love love of ones neighbor love of ones enemy is worthier sweeter and better than the feelings which the beautiful eyes of a young man can inspire in a romantic and loving young girl like yourself the news of count bezkhovs death reached us before your letter and my father was much affected by it he says the count was the last representative but one of the great century and that it is his own turn now but that he will do all he can to let his turn come as late as possible god preserve us from that terrible misfortune i cannot agree with you about pierre whom i knew as a child he always seemed to me to have an excellent heart and that is the quality i value most in people as to his inheritance and the part played by prince vasli it is very sad for both ah my dear friend our divine saviours words that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god are terribly true i pity prince vasli but am still more sorry for pierre so young and burdened with such riches
