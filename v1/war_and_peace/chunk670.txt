glory of russia kutzov did not understand what europe the balance of power or napoleon meant he could not understand it for the representative of the russian people after the enemy had been destroyed and russia had been liberated and raised to the summit of her glory there was nothing left to do as a russian nothing remained for the representative of the national war but to die and kutzov died chapter xii as generally happens pierre did not feel the full effects of the physical privation and strain he had suffered as prisoner until after they were over after his liberation he reached orl and on the third day there when preparing to go to kiev he fell ill and was laid up for three months he had what the doctors termed bilious fever but despite the fact that the doctors treated him bled him and gave him medicines to drink he recovered scarcely any impression was left on pierres mind by all that happened to him from the time of his rescue till his illness he remembered only the dull gray weather now rainy and now snowy internal physical distress and pains in his feet and side he remembered a general impression of the misfortunes and sufferings of people and of being worried by the curiosity of officers and generals who questioned him he also remembered his difficulty in procuring a conveyance and horses and above all he remembered his incapacity to think and feel all that time on the day of his rescue he had seen the body of ptya rostv that same day he had learned that prince andrew after surviving the battle of borodin for more than a month had recently died in the rostvs house at yaroslvl and densov who told him this news also mentioned hlnes death supposing that pierre had heard of it long before all this at the time seemed merely strange to pierre he felt he could not grasp its significance just then he was only anxious to get away as quickly as possible from places where people were killing one another to some peaceful refuge where he could recover himself rest and think over all the strange new facts he had learned but on reaching orl he immediately fell ill when he came to himself after his illness he saw in attendance on him two of his servants ternty and vska who had come from moscow and also his cousin the eldest princess who had been living on his estate at elts and hearing of his rescue and illness had come to look after him it was only gradually during his convalescence that pierre lost the impressions he had become accustomed to during the last few months and got used to the idea that no one would oblige him to go anywhere tomorrow that no one would deprive him of his warm bed and that he would be sure to get his dinner tea and supper but for a long time in his dreams he still saw himself in the conditions of captivity in the same way little by little he came to understand the news he had been told after his rescue about the death of prince andrew the death of his wife and the destruction of the french a joyous feeling of freedom that complete inalienable freedom natural to man which he had first experienced at the first halt outside moscow filled pierres soul during his convalescence he was surprised to find that this inner freedom which was independent of external conditions now had as it were an additional setting of external liberty he was alone in a strange town without acquaintances no one demanded anything of him or sent him anywhere he had all he wanted the thought of his wife which had been a continual torment to him was no longer there since she was no more oh how good how splendid said he to himself when a cleanly laid table was moved up to him with savory beef tea or when he lay down for the night on a soft clean bed or when he remembered that the french had gone and that his wife was no more oh how good how splendid and by old habit he asked himself the question well and what then what am i going to do and he immediately gave himself the answer well i shall live ah how splendid the very question that had formerly tormented him the thing he had continually sought to find the aim of life
