bad and every learned militarist criticizes them with looks of importance when they relate to a battle that has been lost and the very worst dispositions and orders seem very good and serious people fill whole volumes to demonstrate their merits when they relate to a battle that has been won the dispositions drawn up by weyrother for the battle of austerlitz were a model of perfection for that kind of composition but still they were criticized criticized for their very perfection for their excessive minuteness napoleon at the battle of borodin fulfilled his office as representative of authority as well as and even better than at other battles he did nothing harmful to the progress of the battle he inclined to the most reasonable opinions he made no confusion did not contradict himself did not get frightened or run away from the field of battle but with his great tact and military experience carried out his role of appearing to command calmly and with dignity chapter xxix on returning from a second inspection of the lines napoleon remarked the chessmen are set up the game will begin tomorrow having ordered punch and summoned de beausset he began to talk to him about paris and about some changes he meant to make in the empress household surprising the prefect by his memory of minute details relating to the court he showed an interest in trifles joked about de beaussets love of travel and chatted carelessly as a famous self-confident surgeon who knows his job does when turning up his sleeves and putting on his apron while a patient is being strapped to the operating table the matter is in my hands and is clear and definite in my head when the time comes to set to work i shall do it as no one else could but now i can jest and the more i jest and the calmer i am the more tranquil and confident you ought to be and the more amazed at my genius having finished his second glass of punch napoleon went to rest before the serious business which he considered awaited him next day he was so much interested in that task that he was unable to sleep and in spite of his cold which had grown worse from the dampness of the evening he went into the large division of the tent at three oclock in the morning loudly blowing his nose he asked whether the russians had not withdrawn and was told that the enemys fires were still in the same places he nodded approval the adjutant in attendance came into the tent well rapp do you think we shall do good business today napoleon asked him without doubt sire replied rapp napoleon looked at him do you remember sire what you did me the honor to say at smolnsk continued rapp the wine is drawn and must be drunk napoleon frowned and sat silent for a long time leaning his head on his hand this poor army he suddenly remarked it has diminished greatly since smolnsk fortune is frankly a courtesan rapp i have always said so and i am beginning to experience it but the guards rapp the guards are intact he remarked interrogatively yes sire replied rapp napoleon took a lozenge put it in his mouth and glanced at his watch he was not sleepy and it was still not nearly morning it was impossible to give further orders for the sake of killing time for the orders had all been given and were now being executed have the biscuits and rice been served out to the regiments of the guards asked napoleon sternly yes sire the rice too rapp replied that he had given the emperors order about the rice but napoleon shook his head in dissatisfaction as if not believing that his order had been executed an attendant came in with punch napoleon ordered another glass to be brought for rapp and silently sipped his own i have neither taste nor smell he remarked sniffing at his glass this cold is tiresome they talk about medicine what is the good of medicine when it cant cure a cold corvisart gave me these lozenges but they dont help at all what can doctors cure one cant cure anything our body is a machine for living it is organized for that it is its nature let life go on in it unhindered and let it defend itself it will do more than if you paralyze it by encumbering it with remedies our
