yet someday think what fun it will be when i am his wife and you marry nicholas natsha i have asked you not to speak of that let us talk about you they were silent awhile but why go to petersburg natsha suddenly asked and hastily replied to her own question but no no he must yes mary he must first epilogue chapter i seven years had passed the storm-tossed sea of european history had subsided within its shores and seemed to have become calm but the mysterious forces that move humanity mysterious because the laws of their motion are unknown to us continued to operate though the surface of the sea of history seemed motionless the movement of humanity went on as unceasingly as the flow of time various groups of people formed and dissolved the coming formation and dissolution of kingdoms and displacement of peoples was in course of preparation the sea of history was not driven spasmodically from shore to shore as previously it was seething in its depths historic figures were not borne by the waves from one shore to another as before they now seemed to rotate on one spot the historical figures at the head of armies who formerly reflected the movement of the masses by ordering wars campaigns and battles now reflected the restless movement by political and diplomatic combinations laws and treaties the historians call this activity of the historical figures the reaction in dealing with this period they sternly condemn the historical personages who in their opinion caused what they describe as the reaction all the well-known people of that period from alexander and napoleon to madame de stal photius schelling fichte chateaubriand and the rest pass before their stern judgment seat and are acquitted or condemned according to whether they conduced to progress or to reaction according to their accounts a reaction took place at that time in russia also and the chief culprit was alexander i the same man who according to them was the chief cause of the liberal movement at the commencement of his reign being the savior of russia there is no one in russian literature now from schoolboy essayist to learned historian who does not throw his little stone at alexander for things he did wrong at this period of his reign he ought to have acted in this way and in that way in this case he did well and in that case badly he behaved admirably at the beginning of his reign and during but acted badly by giving a constitution to poland forming the holy alliance entrusting power to arakchev favoring goltsyn and mysticism and afterwards shishkv and photius he also acted badly by concerning himself with the active army and disbanding the semnov regiment it would take a dozen pages to enumerate all the reproaches the historians address to him based on their knowledge of what is good for humanity what do these reproaches mean do not the very actions for which the historians praise alexander i the liberal attempts at the beginning of his reign his struggle with napoleon the firmness he displayed in and the campaign of flow from the same sources the circumstances of his birth education and life that made his personality what it was and from which the actions for which they blame him the holy alliance the restoration of poland and the reaction of and later also flowed in what does the substance of those reproaches lie it lies in the fact that an historic character like alexander i standing on the highest possible pinnacle of human power with the blinding light of history focused upon him a character exposed to those strongest of all influences the intrigues flattery and self-deception inseparable from power a character who at every moment of his life felt a responsibility for all that was happening in europe and not a fictitious but a live character who like every man had his personal habits passions and impulses toward goodness beauty and truth that this character though not lacking in virtue the historians do not accuse him of that had not the same conception of the welfare of humanity fifty years ago as a present-day professor who from his youth upwards has been occupied with learning that is with books and lectures and with taking notes from them but even if we assume that fifty years ago alexander i was mistaken in his view of what was good for the people we must inevitably assume that the historian who judges alexander will also
