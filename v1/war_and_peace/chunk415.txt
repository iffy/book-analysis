divided and our sole aim was to unite them though uniting the armies was no advantage if we meant to retire and lure the enemy into the depths of the country our emperor joined the army to encourage it to defend every inch of russian soil and not to retreat the enormous drissa camp was formed on pfuels plan and there was no intention of retiring farther the emperor reproached the commanders in chief for every step they retired he could not bear the idea of letting the enemy even reach smolnsk still less could he contemplate the burning of moscow and when our armies did unite he was displeased that smolnsk was abandoned and burned without a general engagement having been fought under its walls so thought the emperor and the russian commanders and people were still more provoked at the thought that our forces were retreating into the depths of the country napoleon having cut our armies apart advanced far into the country and missed several chances of forcing an engagement in august he was at smolnsk and thought only of how to advance farther though as we now see that advance was evidently ruinous to him the facts clearly show that napoleon did not foresee the danger of the advance on moscow nor did alexander and the russian commanders then think of luring napoleon on but quite the contrary the luring of napoleon into the depths of the country was not the result of any plan for no one believed it to be possible it resulted from a most complex interplay of intrigues aims and wishes among those who took part in the war and had no perception whatever of the inevitable or of the one way of saving russia everything came about fortuitously the armies were divided at the commencement of the campaign we tried to unite them with the evident intention of giving battle and checking the enemys advance and by this effort to unite them while avoiding battle with a much stronger enemy and necessarily withdrawing the armies at an acute angle we led the french on to smolnsk but we withdrew at an acute angle not only because the french advanced between our two armies the angle became still more acute and we withdrew still farther because barclay de tolly was an unpopular foreigner disliked by bagratin who would come under his command and bagratin being in command of the second army tried to postpone joining up and coming under barclays command as long as he could bagratin was slow in effecting the junction though that was the chief aim of all at headquarters because as he alleged he exposed his army to danger on this march and it was best for him to retire more to the left and more to the south worrying the enemy from flank and rear and securing from the ukraine recruits for his army and it looks as if he planned this in order not to come under the command of the detested foreigner barclay whose rank was inferior to his own the emperor was with the army to encourage it but his presence and ignorance of what steps to take and the enormous number of advisers and plans destroyed the first armys energy and it retired the intention was to make a stand at the drissa camp but paulucci aiming at becoming commander in chief unexpectedly employed his energy to influence alexander and pfuels whole plan was abandoned and the command entrusted to barclay but as barclay did not inspire confidence his power was limited the armies were divided there was no unity of command and barclay was unpopular but from this confusion division and the unpopularity of the foreign commander in chief there resulted on the one hand indecision and the avoidance of a battle which we could not have refrained from had the armies been united and had someone else instead of barclay been in command and on the other an ever-increasing indignation against the foreigners and an increase in patriotic zeal at last the emperor left the army and as the most convenient and indeed the only pretext for his departure it was decided that it was necessary for him to inspire the people in the capitals and arouse the nation in general to a patriotic war and by this visit of the emperor to moscow the strength of the russian army was trebled he left in order not to obstruct the commander in chiefs undivided control of the army and hoping that more decisive
