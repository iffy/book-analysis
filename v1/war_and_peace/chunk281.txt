superiority over her good conscientious husband who all the same understood life wrongly as according to vra all men did berg judging by his wife thought all women weak and foolish vra judging only by her husband and generalizing from that observation supposed that all men though they understand nothing and are conceited and selfish ascribe common sense to themselves alone to be a man berg rose and embraced his wife carefully so as not to crush her lace fichu for which he had paid a good price kissing her straight on the lips the only thing is we mustnt have children too soon he continued following an unconscious sequence of ideas yes answered vra i dont at all want that we must live for society princess yuspova wore one exactly like this said berg pointing to the fichu with a happy and kindly smile just then count bezkhov was announced husband and wife glanced at one another both smiling with self-satisfaction and each mentally claiming the honor of this visit this is what comes of knowing how to make acquaintances thought berg this is what comes of knowing how to conduct oneself but please dont interrupt me when i am entertaining the guests said vra because i know what interests each of them and what to say to different people berg smiled again it cant be helped men must sometimes have masculine conversation said he they received pierre in their small new drawing room where it was impossible to sit down anywhere without disturbing its symmetry neatness and order so it was quite comprehensible and not strange that berg having generously offered to disturb the symmetry of an armchair or of the sofa for his dear guest but being apparently painfully undecided on the matter himself eventually left the visitor to settle the question of selection pierre disturbed the symmetry by moving a chair for himself and berg and vra immediately began their evening party interrupting each other in their efforts to entertain their guest vra having decided in her own mind that pierre ought to be entertained with conversation about the french embassy at once began accordingly berg having decided that masculine conversation was required interrupted his wifes remarks and touched on the question of the war with austria and unconsciously jumped from the general subject to personal considerations as to the proposals made him to take part in the austrian campaign and the reasons why he had declined them though the conversation was very incoherent and vra was angry at the intrusion of the masculine element both husband and wife felt with satisfaction that even if only one guest was present their evening had begun very well and was as like as two peas to every other evening party with its talk tea and lighted candles before long bors bergs old comrade arrived there was a shade of condescension and patronage in his treatment of berg and vra after bors came a lady with the colonel then the general himself then the rostvs and the party became unquestionably exactly like all other evening parties berg and vra could not repress their smiles of satisfaction at the sight of all this movement in their drawing room at the sound of the disconnected talk the rustling of dresses and the bowing and scraping everything was just as everybody always has it especially so the general who admired the apartment patted berg on the shoulder and with parental authority superintended the setting out of the table for boston the general sat down by count ily rostv who was next to himself the most important guest the old people sat with the old the young with the young and the hostess at the tea table on which stood exactly the same kind of cakes in a silver cake basket as the panins had at their party everything was just as it was everywhere else chapter xxi pierre as one of the principal guests had to sit down to boston with count rostv the general and the colonel at the card table he happened to be directly facing natsha and was struck by a curious change that had come over her since the ball she was silent and not only less pretty than at the ball but only redeemed from plainness by her look of gentle indifference to everything around whats the matter with her thought pierre glancing at her she was sitting by her sister at the tea table and reluctantly without looking at him made some reply to bors who sat down
