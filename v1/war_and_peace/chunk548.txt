the common calamity the same feeling that had caused him to go to mozhysk on the twenty-fifth and to make his way to the very thick of the battle and had now caused him to run away from his home and in place of the luxury and comfort to which he was accustomed to sleep on a hard sofa without undressing and eat the same food as gersim the other was that vague and quite russian feeling of contempt for everything conventional artificial and human for everything the majority of men regard as the greatest good in the world pierre had first experienced this strange and fascinating feeling at the slobda palace when he had suddenly felt that wealth power and life all that men so painstakingly acquire and guard if it has any worth has so only by reason of the joy with which it can all be renounced it was the feeling that induces a volunteer recruit to spend his last penny on drink and a drunken man to smash mirrors or glasses for no apparent reason and knowing that it will cost him all the money he possesses the feeling which causes a man to perform actions which from an ordinary point of view are insane to test as it were his personal power and strength affirming the existence of a higher nonhuman criterion of life from the very day pierre had experienced this feeling for the first time at the slobda palace he had been continuously under its influence but only now found full satisfaction for it moreover at this moment pierre was supported in his design and prevented from renouncing it by what he had already done in that direction if he were now to leave moscow like everyone else his flight from home the peasant coat the pistol and his announcement to the rostvs that he would remain in moscow would all become not merely meaningless but contemptible and ridiculous and to this pierre was very sensitive pierres physical condition as is always the case corresponded to his mental state the unaccustomed coarse food the vodka he drank during those days the absence of wine and cigars his dirty unchanged linen two almost sleepless nights passed on a short sofa without bedding all this kept him in a state of excitement bordering on insanity it was two oclock in the afternoon the french had already entered moscow pierre knew this but instead of acting he only thought about his undertaking going over its minutest details in his mind in his fancy he did not clearly picture to himself either the striking of the blow or the death of napoleon but with extraordinary vividness and melancholy enjoyment imagined his own destruction and heroic endurance yes alone for the sake of all i must do it or perish he thought yes i will approach and then suddenly with pistol or dagger but that is all the same it is not i but the hand of providence that punishes thee i shall say thought he imagining what he would say when killing napoleon well then take me and execute me he went on speaking to himself and bowing his head with a sad but firm expression while pierre standing in the middle of the room was talking to himself in this way the study door opened and on the threshold appeared the figure of makr alexevich always so timid before but now quite transformed his dressing gown was unfastened his face red and distorted he was obviously drunk on seeing pierre he grew confused at first but noticing embarrassment on pierres face immediately grew bold and staggering on his thin legs advanced into the middle of the room theyre frightened he said confidentially in a hoarse voice i say i wont surrender i say am i not right sir he paused and then suddenly seeing the pistol on the table seized it with unexpected rapidity and ran out into the corridor gersim and the porter who had followed makr alexevich stopped him in the vestibule and tried to take the pistol from him pierre coming out into the corridor looked with pity and repulsion at the half-crazy old man makr alexevich frowning with exertion held on to the pistol and screamed hoarsely evidently with some heroic fancy in his head to arms board them no you shant get it he yelled that will do please that will do have the goodness please sir to let go please sir pleaded gersim trying carefully to steer makr alexevich by the elbows
