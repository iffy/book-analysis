for the crime or the acknowledgment of the merit of the virtuous act or the freedom of the apparently original action that a criminal was reared among malefactors mitigates his fault in our eyes the self-sacrifice of a father or mother or self-sacrifice with the possibility of a reward is more comprehensible than gratuitous self-sacrifice and therefore seems less deserving of sympathy and less the result of free will the founder of a sect or party or an inventor impresses us less when we know how or by what the way was prepared for his activity if we have a large range of examples if our observation is constantly directed to seeking the correlation of cause and effect in peoples actions their actions appear to us more under compulsion and less free the more correctly we connect the effects with the causes if we examined simple actions and had a vast number of such actions under observation our conception of their inevitability would be still greater the dishonest conduct of the son of a dishonest father the misconduct of a woman who had fallen into bad company a drunkards relapse into drunkenness and so on are actions that seem to us less free the better we understand their cause if the man whose actions we are considering is on a very low stage of mental development like a child a madman or a simpleton then knowing the causes of the act and the simplicity of the character and intelligence in question we see so large an element of necessity and so little free will that as soon as we know the cause prompting the action we can foretell the result on these three considerations alone is based the conception of irresponsibility for crimes and the extenuating circumstances admitted by all legislative codes the responsibility appears greater or less according to our greater or lesser knowledge of the circumstances in which the man was placed whose action is being judged and according to the greater or lesser interval of time between the commission of the action and its investigation and according to the greater or lesser understanding of the causes that led to the action chapter x thus our conception of free will and inevitability gradually diminishes or increases according to the greater or lesser connection with the external world the greater or lesser remoteness of time and the greater or lesser dependence on the causes in relation to which we contemplate a mans life so that if we examine the case of a man whose connection with the external world is well known where the time between the action and its examination is great and where the causes of the action are most accessible we get the conception of a maximum of inevitability and a minimum of free will if we examine a man little dependent on external conditions whose action was performed very recently and the causes of whose action are beyond our ken we get the conception of a minimum of inevitability and a maximum of freedom in neither case however we may change our point of view however plain we may make to ourselves the connection between the man and the external world however inaccessible it may be to us however long or short the period of time however intelligible or incomprehensible the causes of the action may be can we ever conceive either complete freedom or complete necessity to whatever degree we may imagine a man to be exempt from the influence of the external world we never get a conception of freedom in space every human action is inevitably conditioned by what surrounds him and by his own body i lift my arm and let it fall my action seems to me free but asking myself whether i could raise my arm in every direction i see that i raised it in the direction in which there was least obstruction to that action either from things around me or from the construction of my own body i chose one out of all the possible directions because in it there were fewest obstacles for my action to be free it was necessary that it should encounter no obstacles to conceive of a man being free we must imagine him outside space which is evidently impossible however much we approximate the time of judgment to the time of the deed we never get a conception of freedom in time for if i examine an action committed a second ago i must still recognize it as not being free for
