had told the coachman this or that the man ought to have known it for himself on reaching home pierre gave orders to evstfey his head coachman who knew everything could do anything and was known to all moscow that he would leave that night for the army at mozhysk and that his saddle horses should be sent there this could not all be arranged that day so on evstfeys representation pierre had to put off his departure till next day to allow time for the relay horses to be sent on in advance on the twenty-fourth the weather cleared up after a spell of rain and after dinner pierre left moscow when changing horses that night in perkhshkovo he learned that there had been a great battle that evening this was the battle of shevrdino he was told that there in perkhshkovo the earth trembled from the firing but nobody could answer his questions as to who had won at dawn next day pierre was approaching mozhysk every house in mozhysk had soldiers quartered in it and at the hostel where pierre was met by his groom and coachman there was no room to be had it was full of officers everywhere in mozhysk and beyond it troops were stationed or on the march cossacks foot and horse soldiers wagons caissons and cannon were everywhere pierre pushed forward as fast as he could and the farther he left moscow behind and the deeper he plunged into that sea of troops the more was he overcome by restless agitation and a new and joyful feeling he had not experienced before it was a feeling akin to what he had felt at the slobda palace during the emperors visit a sense of the necessity of undertaking something and sacrificing something he now experienced a glad consciousness that everything that constitutes mens happiness the comforts of life wealth even life itself is rubbish it is pleasant to throw away compared with something with what pierre could not say and he did not try to determine for whom and for what he felt such particular delight in sacrificing everything he was not occupied with the question of what to sacrifice for the fact of sacrificing in itself afforded him a new and joyous sensation chapter xix on the twenty-fourth of august the battle of the shevrdino redoubt was fought on the twenty-fifth not a shot was fired by either side and on the twenty-sixth the battle of borodin itself took place why and how were the battles of shevrdino and borodin given and accepted why was the battle of borodin fought there was not the least sense in it for either the french or the russians its immediate result for the russians was and was bound to be that we were brought nearer to the destruction of moscow which we feared more than anything in the world and for the french its immediate result was that they were brought nearer to the destruction of their whole army which they feared more than anything in the world what the result must be was quite obvious and yet napoleon offered and kutzov accepted that battle if the commanders had been guided by reason it would seem that it must have been obvious to napoleon that by advancing thirteen hundred miles and giving battle with a probability of losing a quarter of his army he was advancing to certain destruction and it must have been equally clear to kutzov that by accepting battle and risking the loss of a quarter of his army he would certainly lose moscow for kutzov this was mathematically clear as it is that if when playing draughts i have one man less and go on exchanging i shall certainly lose and therefore should not exchange when my opponent has sixteen men and i have fourteen i am only one eighth weaker than he but when i have exchanged thirteen more men he will be three times as strong as i am before the battle of borodin our strength in proportion to the french was about as five to six but after that battle it was little more than one to two previously we had a hundred thousand against a hundred and twenty thousand afterwards little more than fifty thousand against a hundred thousand yet the shrewd and experienced kutzov accepted the battle while napoleon who was said to be a commander of genius gave it losing a quarter of his army and lengthening his lines of communication still more if it is said
