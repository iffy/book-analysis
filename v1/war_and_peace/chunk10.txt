all like the conduct of a great man and the prisoners he killed in africa that was horrible said the little princess shrugging her shoulders hes a low fellow say what you will remarked prince hippolyte pierre not knowing whom to answer looked at them all and smiled his smile was unlike the half-smile of other people when he smiled his grave even rather gloomy look was instantaneously replaced by another a childlike kindly even rather silly look which seemed to ask forgiveness the vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that this young jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested all were silent how do you expect him to answer you all at once said prince andrew besides in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish between his acts as a private person as a general and as an emperor so it seems to me yes yes of course pierre chimed in pleased at the arrival of this reinforcement one must admit continued prince andrew that napoleon as a man was great on the bridge of arcola and in the hospital at jaffa where he gave his hand to the plague-stricken but but there are other acts which it is difficult to justify prince andrew who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of pierres remarks rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to go suddenly prince hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend and asking them all to be seated began i was told a charming moscow story today and must treat you to it excuse me vicomte i must tell it in russian or the point will be lost and prince hippolyte began to tell his story in such russian as a frenchman would speak after spending about a year in russia everyone waited so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their attention to his story there is in moscow a lady une dame and she is very stingy she must have two footmen behind her carriage and very big ones that was her taste and she had a ladys maid also big she said here prince hippolyte paused evidently collecting his ideas with difficulty she said oh yes she said girl to the maid put on a livery get up behind the carriage and come with me while i make some calls here prince hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before his audience which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator several persons among them the elderly lady and anna pvlovna did however smile she went suddenly there was a great wind the girl lost her hat and her long hair came down here he could contain himself no longer and went on between gasps of laughter and the whole world knew and so the anecdote ended though it was unintelligible why he had told it or why it had to be told in russian still anna pvlovna and the others appreciated prince hippolytes social tact in so agreeably ending pierres unpleasant and unamiable outburst after the anecdote the conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last and next balls about theatricals and who would meet whom and when and where chapter vi having thanked anna pvlovna for her charming soiree the guests began to take their leave pierre was ungainly stout about the average height broad with huge red hands he did not know as the saying is how to enter a drawing room and still less how to leave one that is how to say something particularly agreeable before going away besides this he was absent-minded when he rose to go he took up instead of his own the generals three-cornered hat and held it pulling at the plume till the general asked him to restore it all his absent-mindedness and inability to enter a room and converse in it was however redeemed by his kindly simple and modest expression anna pvlovna turned toward him and with a christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his indiscretion nodded and said i hope to see you again but i also hope you will change your opinions my dear monsieur pierre when she said this he did not reply and only bowed but again everybody saw his smile which said nothing unless perhaps opinions are opinions but you see what a capital good-natured fellow i am and everyone including anna pvlovna felt this prince andrew had gone out into the hall and turning his shoulders to the footman who was helping
