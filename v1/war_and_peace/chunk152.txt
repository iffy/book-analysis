of war and will hear him when he talks sense but to temporize and wait for something now when bonaparte fears nothing so much as a general battle is impossible yes you have seen him said prince andrew well what is bonaparte like how did he impress you yes i saw him and am convinced that he fears nothing so much as a general engagement repeated dolgorkov evidently prizing this general conclusion which he had arrived at from his interview with napoleon if he werent afraid of a battle why did he ask for that interview why negotiate and above all why retreat when to retreat is so contrary to his method of conducting war believe me he is afraid afraid of a general battle his hour has come mark my words but tell me what is he like eh said prince andrew again he is a man in a gray overcoat very anxious that i should call him your majesty but who to his chagrin got no title from me thats the sort of man he is and nothing more replied dolgorkov looking round at bilbin with a smile despite my great respect for old kutzov he continued we should be a nice set of fellows if we were to wait about and so give him a chance to escape or to trick us now that we certainly have him in our hands no we mustnt forget suvrov and his rule not to put yourself in a position to be attacked but yourself to attack believe me in war the energy of young men often shows the way better than all the experience of old cunctators but in what position are we going to attack him i have been at the outposts today and it is impossible to say where his chief forces are situated said prince andrew he wished to explain to dolgorkov a plan of attack he had himself formed oh that is all the same dolgorkov said quickly and getting up he spread a map on the table all eventualities have been foreseen if he is standing before brnn and prince dolgorkov rapidly but indistinctly explained weyrothers plan of a flanking movement prince andrew began to reply and to state his own plan which might have been as good as weyrothers but for the disadvantage that weyrothers had already been approved as soon as prince andrew began to demonstrate the defects of the latter and the merits of his own plan prince dolgorkov ceased to listen to him and gazed absent-mindedly not at the map but at prince andrews face there will be a council of war at kutzovs tonight though you can say all this there remarked dolgorkov i will do so said prince andrew moving away from the map whatever are you bothering about gentlemen said bilbin who till then had listened with an amused smile to their conversation and now was evidently ready with a joke whether tomorrow brings victory or defeat the glory of our russian arms is secure except your kutzov there is not a single russian in command of a column the commanders are herr general wimpfen le comte de langeron le prince de lichtenstein le prince de hohenlohe and finally prishprish and so on like all those polish names be quiet backbiter said dolgorkov it is not true there are now two russians milordovich and dokhtrov and there would be a third count arakchev if his nerves were not too weak however i think general kutzov has come out said prince andrew i wish you good luck and success gentlemen he added and went out after shaking hands with dolgorkov and bilbin on the way home prince andrew could not refrain from asking kutzov who was sitting silently beside him what he thought of tomorrows battle kutzov looked sternly at his adjutant and after a pause replied i think the battle will be lost and so i told count tolsty and asked him to tell the emperor what do you think he replied but my dear general i am engaged with rice and cutlets look after military matters yourself yes that was the answer i got chapter xii shortly after nine oclock that evening weyrother drove with his plans to kutzovs quarters where the council of war was to be held all the commanders of columns were summoned to the commander in chiefs and with the exception of prince bagratin who declined to come were all there at the appointed time weyrother who was in full control of the proposed battle
