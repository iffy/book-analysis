evidently did not understand it in the bright light of the emotion that shone within himself and at once without any effort saw in everyone he met everything that was good and worthy of being loved when dealing with the affairs and papers of his dead wife her memory aroused in him no feeling but pity that she had not known the bliss he now knew prince vasli who having obtained a new post and some fresh decorations was particularly proud at this time seemed to him a pathetic kindly old man much to be pitied often in afterlife pierre recalled this period of blissful insanity all the views he formed of men and circumstances at this time remained true for him always he not only did not renounce them subsequently but when he was in doubt or inwardly at variance he referred to the views he had held at this time of his madness and they always proved correct i may have appeared strange and queer then he thought but i was not so mad as i seemed on the contrary i was then wiser and had more insight than at any other time and understood all that is worth understanding in life because because i was happy pierres insanity consisted in not waiting as he used to do to discover personal attributes which he termed good qualities in people before loving them his heart was now overflowing with love and by loving people without cause he discovered indubitable causes for loving them chapter xx after pierres departure that first evening when natsha had said to princess mary with a gaily mocking smile he looks just yes just as if he had come out of a russian bath in a short coat and with his hair cropped something hidden and unknown to herself but irrepressible awoke in natshas soul everything her face walk look and voice was suddenly altered to her own surprise a power of life and hope of happiness rose to the surface and demanded satisfaction from that evening she seemed to have forgotten all that had happened to her she no longer complained of her position did not say a word about the past and no longer feared to make happy plans for the future she spoke little of pierre but when princess mary mentioned him a long-extinguished light once more kindled in her eyes and her lips curved with a strange smile the change that took place in natsha at first surprised princess mary but when she understood its meaning it grieved her can she have loved my brother so little as to be able to forget him so soon she thought when she reflected on the change but when she was with natsha she was not vexed with her and did not reproach her the reawakened power of life that had seized natsha was so evidently irrepressible and unexpected by her that in her presence princess mary felt that she had no right to reproach her even in her heart natsha gave herself up so fully and frankly to this new feeling that she did not try to hide the fact that she was no longer sad but bright and cheerful when princess mary returned to her room after her nocturnal talk with pierre natsha met her on the threshold he has spoken yes he has spoken she repeated and a joyful yet pathetic expression which seemed to beg forgiveness for her joy settled on natshas face i wanted to listen at the door but i knew you would tell me understandable and touching as the look with which natsha gazed at her seemed to princess mary and sorry as she was to see her agitation these words pained her for a moment she remembered her brother and his love but whats to be done she cant help it thought the princess and with a sad and rather stern look she told natsha all that pierre had said on hearing that he was going to petersburg natsha was astounded to petersburg she repeated as if unable to understand but noticing the grieved expression on princess marys face she guessed the reason of that sadness and suddenly began to cry mary said she tell me what i should do i am afraid of being bad whatever you tell me i will do tell me you love him yes whispered natsha then why are you crying i am happy for your sake said princess mary who because of those tears quite forgave natshas joy it wont be just
