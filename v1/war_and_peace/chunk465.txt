with plunging swaying gait into the crowd and stopped behind the priest he crossed himself with an accustomed movement bent till he touched the ground with his hand and bowed his white head with a deep sigh behind kutzov was bennigsen and the suite despite the presence of the commander in chief who attracted the attention of all the superior officers the militiamen and soldiers continued their prayers without looking at him when the service was over kutzov stepped up to the icon sank heavily to his knees bowed to the ground and for a long time tried vainly to rise but could not do so on account of his weakness and weight his white head twitched with the effort at last he rose kissed the icon as a child does with navely pouting lips and again bowed till he touched the ground with his hand the other generals followed his example then the officers and after them with excited faces pressing on one another crowding panting and pushing scrambled the soldiers and militiamen chapter xxii staggering amid the crush pierre looked about him count peter kirlovich how did you get here said a voice pierre looked round bors drubetsky brushing his knees with his hand he had probably soiled them when he too had knelt before the icon came up to him smiling bors was elegantly dressed with a slightly martial touch appropriate to a campaign he wore a long coat and like kutzov had a whip slung across his shoulder meanwhile kutzov had reached the village and seated himself in the shade of the nearest house on a bench which one cossack had run to fetch and another had hastily covered with a rug an immense and brilliant suite surrounded him the icon was carried further accompanied by the throng pierre stopped some thirty paces from kutzov talking to bors he explained his wish to be present at the battle and to see the position this is what you must do said bors i will do the honors of the camp to you you will see everything best from where count bennigsen will be i am in attendance on him you know ill mention it to him but if you want to ride round the position come along with us we are just going to the left flank then when we get back do spend the night with me and well arrange a game of cards of course you know dmtri sergevich those are his quarters and he pointed to the third house in the village of grki but i should like to see the right flank they say its very strong said pierre i should like to start from the moskv river and ride round the whole position well you can do that later but the chief thing is the left flank yes yes but where is prince bolknskis regiment can you point it out to me prince andrews we shall pass it and ill take you to him what about the left flank asked pierre to tell you the truth between ourselves god only knows what state our left flank is in said bors confidentially lowering his voice it is not at all what count bennigsen intended he meant to fortify that knoll quite differently but bors shrugged his shoulders his serene highness would not have it or someone persuaded him you see but bors did not finish for at that moment kaysrov kutzovs adjutant came up to pierre ah kaysrov said bors addressing him with an unembarrassed smile i was just trying to explain our position to the count it is amazing how his serene highness could so foresee the intentions of the french you mean the left flank asked kaysrov yes exactly the left flank is now extremely strong though kutzov had dismissed all unnecessary men from the staff bors had contrived to remain at headquarters after the changes he had established himself with count bennigsen who like all on whom bors had been in attendance considered young prince drubetsky an invaluable man in the higher command there were two sharply defined parties kutzovs party and that of bennigsen the chief of staff bors belonged to the latter and no one else while showing servile respect to kutzov could so create an impression that the old fellow was not much good and that bennigsen managed everything now the decisive moment of battle had come when kutzov would be destroyed and the power pass to bennigsen or even if kutzov won the battle it would be felt
