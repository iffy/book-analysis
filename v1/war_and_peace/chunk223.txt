he had read that vexed him but the fact that the life out there in which he had now no part could perturb him he shut his eyes rubbed his forehead as if to rid himself of all interest in what he had read and listened to what was passing in the nursery suddenly he thought he heard a strange noise through the door he was seized with alarm lest something should have happened to the child while he was reading the letter he went on tiptoe to the nursery door and opened it just as he went in he saw that the nurse was hiding something from him with a scared look and that princess mary was no longer by the cot my dear he heard what seemed to him her despairing whisper behind him as often happens after long sleeplessness and long anxiety he was seized by an unreasoning panic it occurred to him that the child was dead all that he saw and heard seemed to confirm this terror all is over he thought and a cold sweat broke out on his forehead he went to the cot in confusion sure that he would find it empty and that the nurse had been hiding the dead baby he drew the curtain aside and for some time his frightened restless eyes could not find the baby at last he saw him the rosy boy had tossed about till he lay across the bed with his head lower than the pillow and was smacking his lips in his sleep and breathing evenly prince andrew was as glad to find the boy like that as if he had already lost him he bent over him and as his sister had taught him tried with his lips whether the child was still feverish the soft forehead was moist prince andrew touched the head with his hand even the hair was wet so profusely had the child perspired he was not dead but evidently the crisis was over and he was convalescent prince andrew longed to snatch up to squeeze to hold to his heart this helpless little creature but dared not do so he stood over him gazing at his head and at the little arms and legs which showed under the blanket he heard a rustle behind him and a shadow appeared under the curtain of the cot he did not look round but still gazing at the infants face listened to his regular breathing the dark shadow was princess mary who had come up to the cot with noiseless steps lifted the curtain and dropped it again behind her prince andrew recognized her without looking and held out his hand to her she pressed it he has perspired said prince andrew i was coming to tell you so the child moved slightly in his sleep smiled and rubbed his forehead against the pillow prince andrew looked at his sister in the dim shadow of the curtain her luminous eyes shone more brightly than usual from the tears of joy that were in them she leaned over to her brother and kissed him slightly catching the curtain of the cot each made the other a warning gesture and stood still in the dim light beneath the curtain as if not wishing to leave that seclusion where they three were shut off from all the world prince andrew was the first to move away ruffling his hair against the muslin of the curtain yes this is the one thing left me now he said with a sigh chapter x soon after his admission to the masonic brotherhood pierre went to the kiev province where he had the greatest number of serfs taking with him full directions which he had written down for his own guidance as to what he should do on his estates when he reached kiev he sent for all his stewards to the head office and explained to them his intentions and wishes he told them that steps would be taken immediately to free his serfs and that till then they were not to be overburdened with labor women while nursing their babies were not to be sent to work assistance was to be given to the serfs punishments were to be admonitory and not corporal and hospitals asylums and schools were to be established on all the estates some of the stewards there were semiliterate foremen among them listened with alarm supposing these words to mean that the young count was displeased with their management and embezzlement of money
