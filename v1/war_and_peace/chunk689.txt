europe the strength of the justification of the man who stands at the head of the movement grows with the increased size of the group during the ten-year preparatory period this man had formed relations with all the crowned heads of europe the discredited rulers of the world can oppose no reasonable ideal to the insensate napoleonic ideal of glory and grandeur one after another they hasten to display their insignificance before him the king of prussia sends his wife to seek the great mans mercy the emperor of austria considers it a favor that this man receives a daughter of the caesars into his bed the pope the guardian of all that the nations hold sacred utilizes religion for the aggrandizement of the great man it is not napoleon who prepares himself for the accomplishment of his role so much as all those round him who prepare him to take on himself the whole responsibility for what is happening and has to happen there is no step no crime or petty fraud he commits which in the mouths of those around him is not at once represented as a great deed the most suitable fte the germans can devise for him is a celebration of jena and auerstdt not only is he great but so are his ancestors his brothers his stepsons and his brothers-in-law everything is done to deprive him of the remains of his reason and to prepare him for his terrible part and when he is ready so too are the forces the invasion pushes eastward and reaches its final goal moscow that city is taken the russian army suffers heavier losses than the opposing armies had suffered in the former war from austerlitz to wagram but suddenly instead of those chances and that genius which hitherto had so consistently led him by an uninterrupted series of successes to the predestined goal an innumerable sequence of inverse chances occur from the cold in his head at borodin to the sparks which set moscow on fire and the frosts and instead of genius stupidity and immeasurable baseness become evident the invaders flee turn back flee again and all the chances are now not for napoleon but always against him a countermovement is then accomplished from east to west with a remarkable resemblance to the preceding movement from west to east attempted drives from east to west similar to the contrary movements of and precede the great westward movement there is the same coalescence into a group of enormous dimensions the same adhesion of the people of central europe to the movement the same hesitation midway and the same increasing rapidity as the goal is approached paris the ultimate goal is reached the napoleonic government and army are destroyed napoleon himself is no longer of any account all his actions are evidently pitiful and mean but again an inexplicable chance occurs the allies detest napoleon whom they regard as the cause of their sufferings deprived of power and authority his crimes and his craft exposed he should have appeared to them what he appeared ten years previously and one year later an outlawed brigand but by some strange chance no one perceives this his part is not yet ended the man who ten years before and a year later was considered an outlawed brigand is sent to an island two days sail from france which for some reason is presented to him as his dominion and guards are given to him and millions of money are paid him chapter iv the flood of nations begins to subside into its normal channels the waves of the great movement abate and on the calm surface eddies are formed in which float the diplomatists who imagine that they have caused the floods to abate but the smooth sea again suddenly becomes disturbed the diplomatists think that their disagreements are the cause of this fresh pressure of natural forces they anticipate war between their sovereigns the position seems to them insoluble but the wave they feel to be rising does not come from the quarter they expect it rises again from the same point as before paris the last backwash of the movement from the west occurs a backwash which serves to solve the apparently insuperable diplomatic difficulties and ends the military movement of that period of history the man who had devastated france returns to france alone without any conspiracy and without soldiers any guard might arrest him but by strange chance no one does so and all rapturously greet the man they
