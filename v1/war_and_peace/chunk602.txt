outposts now scouted close up to the french stationed at tartino the news of easy successes gained by peasants and guerrilla troops over the french the envy aroused by this the desire for revenge that lay in the heart of every russian as long as the french were in moscow and above all a dim consciousness in every soldiers mind that the relative strength of the armies had changed and that the advantage was now on our side there was a substantial change in the relative strength and an advance had become inevitable and at once as a clock begins to strike and chime as soon as the minute hand has completed a full circle this change was shown by an increased activity whirring and chiming in the higher spheres chapter iii the russian army was commanded by kutzov and his staff and also by the emperor from petersburg before the news of the abandonment of moscow had been received in petersburg a detailed plan of the whole campaign had been drawn up and sent to kutzov for his guidance though this plan had been drawn up on the supposition that moscow was still in our hands it was approved by the staff and accepted as a basis for action kutzov only replied that movements arranged from a distance were always difficult to execute so fresh instructions were sent for the solution of difficulties that might be encountered as well as fresh people who were to watch kutzovs actions and report upon them besides this the whole staff of the russian army was now reorganized the posts left vacant by bagratin who had been killed and by barclay who had gone away in dudgeon had to be filled very serious consideration was given to the question whether it would be better to put a in bs place and b in ds or on the contrary to put d in as place and so on as if anything more than as or bs satisfaction depended on this as a result of the hostility between kutzov and bennigsen his chief of staff the presence of confidential representatives of the emperor and these transfers a more than usually complicated play of parties was going on among the staff of the army a was undermining b d was undermining c and so on in all possible combinations and permutations in all these plottings the subject of intrigue was generally the conduct of the war which all these men believed they were directing but this affair of the war went on independently of them as it had to go that is never in the way people devised but flowing always from the essential attitude of the masses only in the highest spheres did all these schemes crossings and interminglings appear to be a true reflection of what had to happen prince michael ilarinovich wrote the emperor on the second of october in a letter that reached kutzov after the battle at tartino since september moscow has been in the hands of the enemy your last reports were written on the twentieth and during all this time not only has no action been taken against the enemy or for the relief of the ancient capital but according to your last report you have even retreated farther srpukhov is already occupied by an enemy detachment and tla with its famous arsenal so indispensable to the army is in danger from general wintzingerodes reports i see that an enemy corps of ten thousand men is moving on the petersburg road another corps of several thousand men is moving on dmtrov a third has advanced along the vladmir road and a fourth rather considerable detachment is stationed between rza and mozhysk napoleon himself was in moscow as late as the twenty-fifth in view of all this information when the enemy has scattered his forces in large detachments and with napoleon and his guards in moscow is it possible that the enemys forces confronting you are so considerable as not to allow of your taking the offensive on the contrary he is probably pursuing you with detachments or at most with an army corps much weaker than the army entrusted to you it would seem that availing yourself of these circumstances you might advantageously attack a weaker one and annihilate him or at least oblige him to retreat retaining in our hands an important part of the provinces now occupied by the enemy and thereby averting danger from tla and other towns in the interior you will be responsible if the enemy
