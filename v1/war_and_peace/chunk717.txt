individuals make nations act as they wished and by what was the will of these individuals themselves guided the ancients met by recognizing a divinity which subjected the nations to the will of a chosen man and guided the will of that chosen man so as to accomplish ends that were predestined for the ancients these questions were solved by a belief in the direct participation of the deity in human affairs modern history in theory rejects both these principles it would seem that having rejected the belief of the ancients in mans subjection to the deity and in a predetermined aim toward which nations are led modern history should study not the manifestations of power but the causes that produce it but modern history has not done this having in theory rejected the view held by the ancients it still follows them in practice instead of men endowed with divine authority and directly guided by the will of god modern history has given us either heroes endowed with extraordinary superhuman capacities or simply men of very various kinds from monarchs to journalists who lead the masses instead of the former divinely appointed aims of the jewish greek or roman nations which ancient historians regarded as representing the progress of humanity modern history has postulated its own aims the welfare of the french german or english people or in its highest abstraction the welfare and civilization of humanity in general by which is usually meant that of the peoples occupying a small northwesterly portion of a large continent modern history has rejected the beliefs of the ancients without replacing them by a new conception and the logic of the situation has obliged the historians after they had apparently rejected the divine authority of the kings and the fate of the ancients to reach the same conclusion by another road that is to recognize nations guided by individual men and the existence of a known aim to which these nations and humanity at large are tending at the basis of the works of all the modern historians from gibbon to buckle despite their seeming disagreements and the apparent novelty of their outlooks lie those two old unavoidable assumptions in the first place the historian describes the activity of individuals who in his opinion have directed humanity one historian considers only monarchs generals and ministers as being such men while another includes also orators learned men reformers philosophers and poets secondly it is assumed that the goal toward which humanity is being led is known to the historians to one of them this goal is the greatness of the roman spanish or french realm to another it is liberty equality and a certain kind of civilization of a small corner of the world called europe in a ferment arises in paris it grows spreads and is expressed by a movement of peoples from west to east several times it moves eastward and collides with a countermovement from the east westward in it reaches its extreme limit moscow and then with remarkable symmetry a countermovement occurs from east to west attracting to it as the first movement had done the nations of middle europe the counter movement reaches the starting point of the first movement in the west paris and subsides during that twenty-year period an immense number of fields were left untilled houses were burned trade changed its direction millions of men migrated were impoverished or were enriched and millions of christian men professing the law of love of their fellows slew one another what does all this mean why did it happen what made those people burn houses and slay their fellow men what were the causes of these events what force made men act so these are the instinctive plain and most legitimate questions humanity asks itself when it encounters the monuments and tradition of that period for a reply to these questions the common sense of mankind turns to the science of history whose aim is to enable nations and humanity to know themselves if history had retained the conception of the ancients it would have said that god to reward or punish his people gave napoleon power and directed his will to the fulfillment of the divine ends and that reply would have been clear and complete one might believe or disbelieve in the divine significance of napoleon but for anyone believing in it there would have been nothing unintelligible in the history of that period nor would there have been any contradictions but modern history cannot give that reply
