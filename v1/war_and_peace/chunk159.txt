soon as an austrian officer showed himself near a commanding officers quarters the regiment began to move the soldiers ran from the fires thrust their pipes into their boots their bags into the carts got their muskets ready and formed rank the officers buttoned up their coats buckled on their swords and pouches and moved along the ranks shouting the train drivers and orderlies harnessed and packed the wagons and tied on the loads the adjutants and battalion and regimental commanders mounted crossed themselves gave final instructions orders and commissions to the baggage men who remained behind and the monotonous tramp of thousands of feet resounded the column moved forward without knowing where and unable from the masses around them the smoke and the increasing fog to see either the place they were leaving or that to which they were going a soldier on the march is hemmed in and borne along by his regiment as much as a sailor is by his ship however far he has walked whatever strange unknown and dangerous places he reaches just as a sailor is always surrounded by the same decks masts and rigging of his ship so the soldier always has around him the same comrades the same ranks the same sergeant major ivn mtrich the same company dog jack and the same commanders the sailor rarely cares to know the latitude in which his ship is sailing but on the day of battle heaven knows how and whence a stern note of which all are conscious sounds in the moral atmosphere of an army announcing the approach of something decisive and solemn and awakening in the men an unusual curiosity on the day of battle the soldiers excitedly try to get beyond the interests of their regiment they listen intently look about and eagerly ask concerning what is going on around them the fog had grown so dense that though it was growing light they could not see ten paces ahead bushes looked like gigantic trees and level ground like cliffs and slopes anywhere on any side one might encounter an enemy invisible ten paces off but the columns advanced for a long time always in the same fog descending and ascending hills avoiding gardens and enclosures going over new and unknown ground and nowhere encountering the enemy on the contrary the soldiers became aware that in front behind and on all sides other russian columns were moving in the same direction every soldier felt glad to know that to the unknown place where he was going many more of our men were going too there now the krskies have also gone past was being said in the ranks its wonderful what a lot of our troops have gathered lads last night i looked at the campfires and there was no end of them a regular moscow though none of the column commanders rode up to the ranks or talked to the men the commanders as we saw at the council of war were out of humor and dissatisfied with the affair and so did not exert themselves to cheer the men but merely carried out the orders yet the troops marched gaily as they always do when going into action especially to an attack but when they had marched for about an hour in the dense fog the greater part of the men had to halt and an unpleasant consciousness of some dislocation and blunder spread through the ranks how such a consciousness is communicated is very difficult to define but it certainly is communicated very surely and flows rapidly imperceptibly and irrepressibly as water does in a creek had the russian army been alone without any allies it might perhaps have been a long time before this consciousness of mismanagement became a general conviction but as it was the disorder was readily and naturally attributed to the stupid germans and everyone was convinced that a dangerous muddle had been occasioned by the sausage eaters why have we stopped is the way blocked or have we already come up against the french no one cant hear them theyd be firing if we had they were in a hurry enough to start us and now here we stand in the middle of a field without rhyme or reason its all those damned germans muddling what stupid devils yes id send them on in front but no fear theyre crowding up behind and now here we stand hungry i say shall we soon be clear they say the cavalry are blocking the way said
