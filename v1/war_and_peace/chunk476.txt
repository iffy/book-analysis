heavy fire on seeing the attack commence on the right wing the vice-king will occupy the village and cross by its three bridges advancing to the same heights as morands and gibrards divisions which under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt and come into line with the rest of the forces all this must be done in good order le tout se fera avec ordre et mthode as far as possible retaining troops in reserve the imperial camp near mozhysk september these dispositions which are very obscure and confused if one allows oneself to regard the arrangements without religious awe of his genius related to napoleons orders to deal with four points four different orders not one of these was or could be carried out in the disposition it is said first that the batteries placed on the spot chosen by napoleon with the guns of pernetti and fouch which were to come in line with them guns in all were to open fire and shower shells on the russian flches and redoubts this could not be done as from the spots selected by napoleon the projectiles did not carry to the russian works and those guns shot into the air until the nearest commander contrary to napoleons instructions moved them forward the second order was that poniatowski moving to the village through the wood should turn the russian left flank this could not be done and was not done because poniatowski advancing on the village through the wood met tchkov there barring his way and could not and did not turn the russian position the third order was general campan will move through the wood to seize the first fortification general campans division did not seize the first fortification but was driven back for on emerging from the wood it had to reform under grapeshot of which napoleon was unaware the fourth order was the vice-king will occupy the village borodin and cross by its three bridges advancing to the same heights as morands and grards divisions for whose movements no directions are given which under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt and come into line with the rest of the forces as far as one can make out not so much from this unintelligible sentence as from the attempts the vice-king made to execute the orders given him he was to advance from the left through borodin to the redoubt while the divisions of morand and grard were to advance simultaneously from the front all this like the other parts of the disposition was not and could not be executed after passing through borodin the vice-king was driven back to the koloch and could get no farther while the divisions of morand and grard did not take the redoubt but were driven back and the redoubt was only taken at the end of the battle by the cavalry a thing probably unforeseen and not heard of by napoleon so not one of the orders in the disposition was or could be executed but in the disposition it is said that after the fight has commenced in this manner orders will be given in accordance with the enemys movements and so it might be supposed that all necessary arrangements would be made by napoleon during the battle but this was not and could not be done for during the whole battle napoleon was so far away that as appeared later he could not know the course of the battle and not one of his orders during the fight could be executed chapter xxviii many historians say that the french did not win the battle of borodin because napoleon had a cold and that if he had not had a cold the orders he gave before and during the battle would have been still more full of genius and russia would have been lost and the face of the world have been changed to historians who believe that russia was shaped by the will of one man peter the great and that france from a republic became an empire and french armies went to russia at the will of one man napoleon to say that russia remained a power because napoleon had a bad cold on the twenty-fourth of august may seem logical and convincing if it had depended on napoleons will to fight or not to fight the battle of borodin and if this or that other arrangement depended on his will then evidently a cold affecting the manifestation of his will might have saved russia and
