was a conspiracy against him and that they wanted to reunite him with his wife and in the mood he then was this was not even unpleasant to him nothing mattered to him nothing in life seemed to him of much importance and under the influence of the depression that possessed him he valued neither his liberty nor his resolution to punish his wife no one is right and no one is to blame so she too is not to blame he thought if he did not at once give his consent to a reunion with his wife it was only because in his state of depression he did not feel able to take any step had his wife come to him he would not have turned her away compared to what preoccupied him was it not a matter of indifference whether he lived with his wife or not without replying either to his wife or his mother-in-law pierre late one night prepared for a journey and started for moscow to see joseph alexevich this is what he noted in his diary moscow th november i have just returned from my benefactor and hasten to write down what i have experienced joseph alexevich is living poorly and has for three years been suffering from a painful disease of the bladder no one has ever heard him utter a groan or a word of complaint from morning till late at night except when he eats his very plain food he is working at science he received me graciously and made me sit down on the bed on which he lay i made the sign of the knights of the east and of jerusalem and he responded in the same manner asking me with a mild smile what i had learned and gained in the prussian and scottish lodges i told him everything as best i could and told him what i had proposed to our petersburg lodge of the bad reception i had encountered and of my rupture with the brothers joseph alexevich having remained silent and thoughtful for a good while told me his view of the matter which at once lit up for me my whole past and the future path i should follow he surprised me by asking whether i remembered the threefold aim of the order the preservation and study of the mystery the purification and reformation of oneself for its reception and the improvement of the human race by striving for such purification which is the principal aim of these three certainly self-reformation and self-purification only to this aim can we always strive independently of circumstances but at the same time just this aim demands the greatest efforts of us and so led astray by pride losing sight of this aim we occupy ourselves either with the mystery which in our impurity we are unworthy to receive or seek the reformation of the human race while ourselves setting an example of baseness and profligacy illuminism is not a pure doctrine just because it is attracted by social activity and puffed up by pride on this ground joseph alexevich condemned my speech and my whole activity and in the depth of my soul i agreed with him talking of my family affairs he said to me the chief duty of a true mason as i have told you lies in perfecting himself we often think that by removing all the difficulties of our life we shall more quickly reach our aim but on the contrary my dear sir it is only in the midst of worldly cares that we can attain our three chief aims self-knowledge for man can only know himself by comparison self-perfecting which can only be attained by conflict and the attainment of the chief virtue love of death only the vicissitudes of life can show us its vanity and develop our innate love of death or of rebirth to a new life these words are all the more remarkable because in spite of his great physical sufferings joseph alexevich is never weary of life though he loves death for which in spite of the purity and loftiness of his inner man he does not yet feel himself sufficiently prepared my benefactor then explained to me fully the meaning of the great square of creation and pointed out to me that the numbers three and seven are the basis of everything he advised me not to avoid intercourse with the petersburg brothers but to take up only second-grade posts in the lodge to try while diverting
