recognized and bennigsen is the only such man the seventh party consisted of the sort of people who are always to be found especially around young sovereigns and of whom there were particularly many round alexander generals and imperial aides-de-camp passionately devoted to the emperor not merely as a monarch but as a man adoring him sincerely and disinterestedly as rostv had done in and who saw in him not only all the virtues but all human capabilities as well these men though enchanted with the sovereign for refusing the command of the army yet blamed him for such excessive modesty and only desired and insisted that their adored sovereign should abandon his diffidence and openly announce that he would place himself at the head of the army gather round him a commander in chiefs staff and consulting experienced theoreticians and practical men where necessary would himself lead the troops whose spirits would thereby be raised to the highest pitch the eighth and largest group which in its enormous numbers was to the others as ninety-nine to one consisted of men who desired neither peace nor war neither an advance nor a defensive camp at the drissa or anywhere else neither barclay nor the emperor neither pfuel nor bennigsen but only the one most essential thing as much advantage and pleasure for themselves as possible in the troubled waters of conflicting and intersecting intrigues that eddied about the emperors headquarters it was possible to succeed in many ways unthinkable at other times a man who simply wished to retain his lucrative post would today agree with pfuel tomorrow with his opponent and the day after merely to avoid responsibility or to please the emperor would declare that he had no opinion at all on the matter another who wished to gain some advantage would attract the emperors attention by loudly advocating the very thing the emperor had hinted at the day before and would dispute and shout at the council beating his breast and challenging those who did not agree with him to duels thereby proving that he was prepared to sacrifice himself for the common good a third in the absence of opponents between two councils would simply solicit a special gratuity for his faithful services well knowing that at that moment people would be too busy to refuse him a fourth while seemingly overwhelmed with work would often come accidentally under the emperors eye a fifth to achieve his long-cherished aim of dining with the emperor would stubbornly insist on the correctness or falsity of some newly emerging opinion and for this object would produce arguments more or less forcible and correct all the men of this party were fishing for rubles decorations and promotions and in this pursuit watched only the weathercock of imperial favor and directly they noticed it turning in any direction this whole drone population of the army began blowing hard that way so that it was all the harder for the emperor to turn it elsewhere amid the uncertainties of the position with the menace of serious danger giving a peculiarly threatening character to everything amid this vortex of intrigue egotism conflict of views and feelings and the diversity of race among these people this eighth and largest party of those preoccupied with personal interests imparted great confusion and obscurity to the common task whatever question arose a swarm of these drones without having finished their buzzing on a previous theme flew over to the new one and by their hum drowned and obscured the voices of those who were disputing honestly from among all these parties just at the time prince andrew reached the army another a ninth party was being formed and was beginning to raise its voice this was the party of the elders reasonable men experienced and capable in state affairs who without sharing any of those conflicting opinions were able to take a detached view of what was going on at the staff at headquarters and to consider means of escape from this muddle indecision intricacy and weakness the men of this party said and thought that what was wrong resulted chiefly from the emperors presence in the army with his military court and from the consequent presence there of an indefinite conditional and unsteady fluctuation of relations which is in place at court but harmful in an army that a sovereign should reign but not command the army and that the only way out of the position would be for the emperor and his court to leave the army
