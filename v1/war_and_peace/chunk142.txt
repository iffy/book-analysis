prince andrew whom bors was expecting entered the room prince andrew who liked to help young men was flattered by being asked for his assistance and being well disposed toward bors who had managed to please him the day before he wished to do what the young man wanted having been sent with papers from kutzov to the tsarvich he looked in on bors hoping to find him alone when he came in and saw an hussar of the line recounting his military exploits prince andrew could not endure that sort of man he gave bors a pleasant smile frowned as with half-closed eyes he looked at rostv bowed slightly and wearily and sat down languidly on the sofa he felt it unpleasant to have dropped in on bad company rostv flushed up on noticing this but he did not care this was a mere stranger glancing however at bors he saw that he too seemed ashamed of the hussar of the line in spite of prince andrews disagreeable ironical tone in spite of the contempt with which rostv from his fighting army point of view regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer was evidently one rostv felt confused blushed and became silent bors inquired what news there might be on the staff and what without indiscretion one might ask about our plans we shall probably advance replied bolknski evidently reluctant to say more in the presence of a stranger berg took the opportunity to ask with great politeness whether as was rumored the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be doubled to this prince andrew answered with a smile that he could give no opinion on such an important government order and berg laughed gaily as to your business prince andrew continued addressing bors we will talk of it later and he looked round at rostv come to me after the review and we will do what is possible and having glanced round the room prince andrew turned to rostv whose state of unconquerable childish embarrassment now changing to anger he did not condescend to notice and said i think you were talking of the schn grabern affair were you there i was there said rostv angrily as if intending to insult the aide-de-camp bolknski noticed the hussars state of mind and it amused him with a slightly contemptuous smile he said yes there are many stories now told about that affair yes stories repeated rostv loudly looking with eyes suddenly grown furious now at bors now at bolknski yes many stories but our stories are the stories of men who have been under the enemys fire our stories have some weight not like the stories of those fellows on the staff who get rewards without doing anything of whom you imagine me to be one said prince andrew with a quiet and particularly amiable smile a strange feeling of exasperation and yet of respect for this mans self-possession mingled at that moment in rostvs soul i am not talking about you he said i dont know you and frankly i dont want to i am speaking of the staff in general and i will tell you this prince andrew interrupted in a tone of quiet authority you wish to insult me and i am ready to agree with you that it would be very easy to do so if you havent sufficient self-respect but admit that the time and place are very badly chosen in a day or two we shall all have to take part in a greater and more serious duel and besides drubetsky who says he is an old friend of yours is not at all to blame that my face has the misfortune to displease you however he added rising you know my name and where to find me but dont forget that i do not regard either myself or you as having been at all insulted and as a man older than you my advice is to let the matter drop well then on friday after the review i shall expect you drubetsky au revoir exclaimed prince andrew and with a bow to them both he went out only when prince andrew was gone did rostv think of what he ought to have said and he was still more angry at having omitted to say it he ordered his horse at once and coldly taking leave of bors rode home should he go to headquarters next day and challenge that affected adjutant or really let the matter
