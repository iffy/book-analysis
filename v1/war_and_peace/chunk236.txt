arrived too late to take part in the first actions of the campaign it had been neither at pultsk nor at preussisch-eylau and when it joined the army in the field in the second half of the campaign was attached to pltovs division pltovs division was acting independently of the main army several times parts of the pvlograd regiment had exchanged shots with the enemy had taken prisoners and once had even captured marshal oudinots carriages in april the pvlograds were stationed immovably for some weeks near a totally ruined and deserted german village a thaw had set in it was muddy and cold the ice on the river broke and the roads became impassable for days neither provisions for the men nor fodder for the horses had been issued as no transports could arrive the men dispersed about the abandoned and deserted villages searching for potatoes but found few even of these everything had been eaten up and the inhabitants had all fled if any remained they were worse than beggars and nothing more could be taken from them even the soldiers usually pitiless enough instead of taking anything from them often gave them the last of their rations the pvlograd regiment had had only two men wounded in action but had lost nearly half its men from hunger and sickness in the hospitals death was so certain that soldiers suffering from fever or the swelling that came from bad food preferred to remain on duty and hardly able to drag their legs went to the front rather than to the hospitals when spring came on the soldiers found a plant just showing out of the ground that looked like asparagus which for some reason they called mshkas sweet root it was very bitter but they wandered about the fields seeking it and dug it out with their sabers and ate it though they were ordered not to do so as it was a noxious plant that spring a new disease broke out among the soldiers a swelling of the arms legs and face which the doctors attributed to eating this root but in spite of all this the soldiers of densovs squadron fed chiefly on mshkas sweet root because it was the second week that the last of the biscuits were being doled out at the rate of half a pound a man and the last potatoes received had sprouted and frozen the horses also had been fed for a fortnight on straw from the thatched roofs and had become terribly thin though still covered with tufts of felty winter hair despite this destitution the soldiers and officers went on living just as usual despite their pale swollen faces and tattered uniforms the hussars formed line for roll call kept things in order groomed their horses polished their arms brought in straw from the thatched roofs in place of fodder and sat down to dine round the caldrons from which they rose up hungry joking about their nasty food and their hunger as usual in their spare time they lit bonfires steamed themselves before them naked smoked picked out and baked sprouting rotten potatoes told and listened to stories of potmkins and suvrovs campaigns or to legends of alsha the sly or the priests laborer miklka the officers as usual lived in twos and threes in the roofless half-ruined houses the seniors tried to collect straw and potatoes and in general food for the men the younger ones occupied themselves as before some playing cards there was plenty of money though there was no food some with more innocent games such as quoits and skittles the general trend of the campaign was rarely spoken of partly because nothing certain was known about it partly because there was a vague feeling that in the main it was going badly rostv lived as before with densov and since their furlough they had become more friendly than ever densov never spoke of rostvs family but by the tender friendship his commander showed him rostv felt that the elder hussars luckless love for natsha played a part in strengthening their friendship densov evidently tried to expose rostv to danger as seldom as possible and after an action greeted his safe return with evident joy on one of his foraging expeditions in a deserted and ruined village to which he had come in search of provisions rostv found a family consisting of an old pole and his daughter with an infant in arms they were half clad hungry too weak to get away on foot
