phenomena of life under those definitions history should deduce a definition of the conception of freedom and inevitability themselves from the immense quantity of phenomena of which it is cognizant and that always appear dependent on these two elements whatever presentation of the activity of many men or of an individual we may consider we always regard it as the result partly of mans free will and partly of the law of inevitability whether we speak of the migration of the peoples and the incursions of the barbarians or of the decrees of napoleon iii or of someones action an hour ago in choosing one direction out of several for his walk we are unconscious of any contradiction the degree of freedom and inevitability governing the actions of these people is clearly defined for us our conception of the degree of freedom often varies according to differences in the point of view from which we regard the event but every human action appears to us as a certain combination of freedom and inevitability in every action we examine we see a certain measure of freedom and a certain measure of inevitability and always the more freedom we see in any action the less inevitability do we perceive and the more inevitability the less freedom the proportion of freedom to inevitability decreases and increases according to the point of view from which the action is regarded but their relation is always one of inverse proportion a sinking man who clutches at another and drowns him or a hungry mother exhausted by feeding her baby who steals some food or a man trained to discipline who on duty at the word of command kills a defenseless man seem less guilty that is less free and more subject to the law of necessity to one who knows the circumstances in which these people were placed and more free to one who does not know that the man was himself drowning that the mother was hungry that the soldier was in the ranks and so on similarly a man who committed a murder twenty years ago and has since lived peaceably and harmlessly in society seems less guilty and his action more due to the law of inevitability to someone who considers his action after twenty years have elapsed than to one who examined it the day after it was committed and in the same way every action of an insane intoxicated or highly excited man appears less free and more inevitable to one who knows the mental condition of him who committed the action and seems more free and less inevitable to one who does not know it in all these cases the conception of freedom is increased or diminished and the conception of compulsion is correspondingly decreased or increased according to the point of view from which the action is regarded so that the greater the conception of necessity the smaller the conception of freedom and vice versa religion the common sense of mankind the science of jurisprudence and history itself understand alike this relation between necessity and freedom all cases without exception in which our conception of freedom and necessity is increased and diminished depend on three considerations the relation to the external world of the man who commits the deeds his relation to time his relation to the causes leading to the action the first consideration is the clearness of our perception of the mans relation to the external world and the greater or lesser clearness of our understanding of the definite position occupied by the man in relation to everything coexisting with him this is what makes it evident that a drowning man is less free and more subject to necessity than one standing on dry ground and that makes the actions of a man closely connected with others in a thickly populated district or of one bound by family official or business duties seem certainly less free and more subject to necessity than those of a man living in solitude and seclusion if we consider a man alone apart from his relation to everything around him each action of his seems to us free but if we see his relation to anything around him if we see his connection with anything whatever with a man who speaks to him a book he reads the work on which he is engaged even with the air he breathes or the light that falls on the things about him we see that each of these circumstances has an influence on him and controls
