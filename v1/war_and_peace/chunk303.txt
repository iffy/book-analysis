encounter with daniel ah but you are a crusty fellow friend said the count for sole reply daniel gave him a shy childlike meek and amiable smile chapter vi the old count went home and natsha and ptya promised to return very soon but as it was still early the hunt went farther at midday they put the hounds into a ravine thickly overgrown with young trees nicholas standing in a fallow field could see all his whips facing him lay a field of winter rye there his own huntsman stood alone in a hollow behind a hazel bush the hounds had scarcely been loosed before nicholas heard one he knew voltrn giving tongue at intervals other hounds joined in now pausing and now again giving tongue a moment later he heard a cry from the wooded ravine that a fox had been found and the whole pack joining together rushed along the ravine toward the ryefield and away from nicholas he saw the whips in their red caps galloping along the edge of the ravine he even saw the hounds and was expecting a fox to show itself at any moment on the ryefield opposite the huntsman standing in the hollow moved and loosed his borzois and nicholas saw a queer short-legged red fox with a fine brush going hard across the field the borzois bore down on it now they drew close to the fox which began to dodge between the field in sharper and sharper curves trailing its brush when suddenly a strange white borzoi dashed in followed by a black one and everything was in confusion the borzois formed a star-shaped figure scarcely swaying their bodies and with tails turned away from the center of the group two huntsmen galloped up to the dogs one in a red cap the other a stranger in a green coat whats this thought nicholas wheres that huntsman from he is not uncles man the huntsmen got the fox but stayed there a long time without strapping it to the saddle their horses bridled and with high saddles stood near them and there too the dogs were lying the huntsmen waved their arms and did something to the fox then from that spot came the sound of a horn with the signal agreed on in case of a fight thats ilgins huntsman having a row with our ivn said nicholas groom nicholas sent the man to call natsha and ptya to him and rode at a footpace to the place where the whips were getting the hounds together several of the field galloped to the spot where the fight was going on nicholas dismounted and with natsha and ptya who had ridden up stopped near the hounds waiting to see how the matter would end out of the bushes came the huntsman who had been fighting and rode toward his young master with the fox tied to his crupper while still at a distance he took off his cap and tried to speak respectfully but he was pale and breathless and his face was angry one of his eyes was black but he probably was not even aware of it what has happened asked nicholas a likely thing killing a fox our dogs had hunted and it was my gray bitch that caught it go to law indeed he snatches at the fox i gave him one with the fox here it is on my saddle do you want a taste of this said the huntsman pointing to his dagger and probably imagining himself still speaking to his foe nicholas not stopping to talk to the man asked his sister and ptya to wait for him and rode to the spot where the enemys ilgins hunting party was the victorious huntsman rode off to join the field and there surrounded by inquiring sympathizers recounted his exploits the facts were that ilgin with whom the rostvs had a quarrel and were at law hunted over places that belonged by custom to the rostvs and had now as if purposely sent his men to the very woods the rostvs were hunting and let his man snatch a fox their dogs had chased nicholas though he had never seen ilgin with his usual absence of moderation in judgment hated him cordially from reports of his arbitrariness and violence and regarded him as his bitterest foe he rode in angry agitation toward him firmly grasping his whip and fully prepared to take the most resolute and desperate steps to punish his enemy hardly had he passed
