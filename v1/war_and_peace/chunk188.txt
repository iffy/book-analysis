their troubles he digested his sufferings alone it is all all her fault he said to himself but what of that why did i bind myself to her why did i say je vous aime to her which was a lie and worse than a lie i am guilty and must endure what a slur on my name a misfortune for life oh thats nonsense he thought the slur on my name and honor thats all apart from myself i love you louis xvi was executed because they said he was dishonorable and a criminal came into pierres head and from their point of view they were right as were those too who canonized him and died a martyrs death for his sake then robespierre was beheaded for being a despot who is right and who is wrong no one but if you are alive live tomorrow youll die as i might have died an hour ago and is it worth tormenting oneself when one has only a moment of life in comparison with eternity but at the moment when he imagined himself calmed by such reflections she suddenly came into his mind as she was at the moments when he had most strongly expressed his insincere love for her and he felt the blood rush to his heart and had again to get up and move about and break and tear whatever came to his hand why did i tell her that je vous aime he kept repeating to himself and when he had said it for the tenth time molires words mais que diable allait-il faire dans cette galre occurred to him and he began to laugh at himself but what the devil was he doing in that galley in the night he called his valet and told him to pack up to go to petersburg he could not imagine how he could speak to her now he resolved to go away next day and leave a letter informing her of his intention to part from her forever next morning when the valet came into the room with his coffee pierre was lying asleep on the ottoman with an open book in his hand he woke up and looked round for a while with a startled expression unable to realize where he was the countess told me to inquire whether your excellency was at home said the valet but before pierre could decide what answer he would send the countess herself in a white satin dressing gown embroidered with silver and with simply dressed hair two immense plaits twice round her lovely head like a coronet entered the room calm and majestic except that there was a wrathful wrinkle on her rather prominent marble brow with her imperturbable calm she did not begin to speak in front of the valet she knew of the duel and had come to speak about it she waited till the valet had set down the coffee things and left the room pierre looked at her timidly over his spectacles and like a hare surrounded by hounds who lays back her ears and continues to crouch motionless before her enemies he tried to continue reading but feeling this to be senseless and impossible he again glanced timidly at her she did not sit down but looked at him with a contemptuous smile waiting for the valet to go well whats this now what have you been up to now i should like to know she asked sternly i what have i stammered pierre so it seems youre a hero eh come now what was this duel about what is it meant to prove what i ask you pierre turned over heavily on the ottoman and opened his mouth but could not reply if you wont answer ill tell you hlne went on you believe everything youre told you were told hlne laughed that dlokhov was my lover she said in french with her coarse plainness of speech uttering the word amant as casually as any other word and you believed it well what have you proved what does this duel prove that youre a fool que vous tes un sot but everybody knew that what will be the result that i shall be the laughingstock of all moscow that everyone will say that you drunk and not knowing what you were about challenged a man you are jealous of without cause hlne raised her voice and became more and more excited a man whos a better man than you in every way hm hm growled
