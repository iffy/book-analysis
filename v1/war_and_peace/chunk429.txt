subjects what are we scared at and of whom are we afraid i am not to blame that the minister is vacillating a coward dense dilatory and has all bad qualities the whole army bewails it and calls down curses upon him chapter vi among the innumerable categories applicable to the phenomena of human life one may discriminate between those in which substance prevails and those in which form prevails to the latter as distinguished from village country provincial or even moscow life we may allot petersburg life and especially the life of its salons that life of the salons is unchanging since the year we had made peace and had again quarreled with bonaparte and had made constitutions and unmade them again but the salons of anna pvlovna and hlne remained just as they had been the one seven and the other five years before at anna pvlovnas they talked with perplexity of bonapartes successes just as before and saw in them and in the subservience shown to him by the european sovereigns a malicious conspiracy the sole object of which was to cause unpleasantness and anxiety to the court circle of which anna pvlovna was the representative and in hlnes salon which rumyntsev himself honored with his visits regarding hlne as a remarkably intelligent woman they talked with the same ecstasy in as in of the great nation and the great man and regretted our rupture with france a rupture which according to them ought to be promptly terminated by peace of late since the emperors return from the army there had been some excitement in these conflicting salon circles and some demonstrations of hostility to one another but each camp retained its own tendency in anna pvlovnas circle only those frenchmen were admitted who were deep-rooted legitimists and patriotic views were expressed to the effect that one ought not to go to the french theater and that to maintain the french troupe was costing the government as much as a whole army corps the progress of the war was eagerly followed and only the reports most flattering to our army were circulated in the french circle of hlne and rumyntsev the reports of the cruelty of the enemy and of the war were contradicted and all napoleons attempts at conciliation were discussed in that circle they discountenanced those who advised hurried preparations for a removal to kazn of the court and the girls educational establishments under the patronage of the dowager empress in hlnes circle the war in general was regarded as a series of formal demonstrations which would very soon end in peace and the view prevailed expressed by bilbin who now in petersburg was quite at home in hlnes house which every clever man was obliged to visit that not by gunpowder but by those who invented it would matters be settled in that circle the moscow enthusiasm news of which had reached petersburg simultaneously with the emperors return was ridiculed sarcastically and very cleverly though with much caution anna pvlovnas circle on the contrary was enraptured by this enthusiasm and spoke of it as plutarch speaks of the deeds of the ancients prince vasli who still occupied his former important posts formed a connecting link between these two circles he visited his good friend anna pvlovna as well as his daughters diplomatic salon and often in his constant comings and goings between the two camps became confused and said at hlnes what he should have said at anna pvlovnas and vice versa soon after the emperors return prince vasli in a conversation about the war at anna pvlovnas severely condemned barclay de tolly but was undecided as to who ought to be appointed commander in chief one of the visitors usually spoken of as a man of great merit having described how he had that day seen kutzov the newly chosen chief of the petersburg militia presiding over the enrollment of recruits at the treasury cautiously ventured to suggest that kutzov would be the man to satisfy all requirements anna pvlovna remarked with a melancholy smile that kutzov had done nothing but cause the emperor annoyance i have talked and talked at the assembly of the nobility prince vasli interrupted but they did not listen to me i told them his election as chief of the militia would not please the emperor they did not listen to me its all this mania for opposition he went on and who for it is all because we want to ape the foolish enthusiasm of those muscovites prince vasli
