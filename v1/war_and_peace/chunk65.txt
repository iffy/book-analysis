were still five men between him and dlokhov with his bluish-gray uniform dlokhov slowly straightened his bent knee looking straight with his clear insolent eyes in the generals face why a blue coat off with it sergeant major change his coat the ras he did not finish general i must obey orders but i am not bound to endure dlokhov hurriedly interrupted no talking in the ranks no talking no talking not bound to endure insults dlokhov concluded in loud ringing tones the eyes of the general and the soldier met the general became silent angrily pulling down his tight scarf i request you to have the goodness to change your coat he said as he turned away chapter ii hes coming shouted the signaler at that moment the regimental commander flushing ran to his horse seized the stirrup with trembling hands threw his body across the saddle righted himself drew his saber and with a happy and resolute countenance opening his mouth awry prepared to shout the regiment fluttered like a bird preening its plumage and became motionless att-ention shouted the regimental commander in a soul-shaking voice which expressed joy for himself severity for the regiment and welcome for the approaching chief along the broad country road edged on both sides by trees came a high light blue viennese calche slightly creaking on its springs and drawn by six horses at a smart trot behind the calche galloped the suite and a convoy of croats beside kutzov sat an austrian general in a white uniform that looked strange among the russian black ones the calche stopped in front of the regiment kutzov and the austrian general were talking in low voices and kutzov smiled slightly as treading heavily he stepped down from the carriage just as if those two thousand men breathlessly gazing at him and the regimental commander did not exist the word of command rang out and again the regiment quivered as with a jingling sound it presented arms then amidst a dead silence the feeble voice of the commander in chief was heard the regiment roared health to your ex len len lency and again all became silent at first kutzov stood still while the regiment moved then he and the general in white accompanied by the suite walked between the ranks from the way the regimental commander saluted the commander in chief and devoured him with his eyes drawing himself up obsequiously and from the way he walked through the ranks behind the generals bending forward and hardly able to restrain his jerky movements and from the way he darted forward at every word or gesture of the commander in chief it was evident that he performed his duty as a subordinate with even greater zeal than his duty as a commander thanks to the strictness and assiduity of its commander the regiment in comparison with others that had reached braunau at the same time was in splendid condition there were only sick and stragglers everything was in good order except the boots kutzov walked through the ranks sometimes stopping to say a few friendly words to officers he had known in the turkish war sometimes also to the soldiers looking at their boots he several times shook his head sadly pointing them out to the austrian general with an expression which seemed to say that he was not blaming anyone but could not help noticing what a bad state of things it was the regimental commander ran forward on each such occasion fearing to miss a single word of the commander in chiefs regarding the regiment behind kutzov at a distance that allowed every softly spoken word to be heard followed some twenty men of his suite these gentlemen talked among themselves and sometimes laughed nearest of all to the commander in chief walked a handsome adjutant this was prince bolknski beside him was his comrade nesvtski a tall staff officer extremely stout with a kindly smiling handsome face and moist eyes nesvtski could hardly keep from laughter provoked by a swarthy hussar officer who walked beside him this hussar with a grave face and without a smile or a change in the expression of his fixed eyes watched the regimental commanders back and mimicked his every movement each time the commander started and bent forward the hussar started and bent forward in exactly the same manner nesvtski laughed and nudged the others to make them look at the wag kutzov walked slowly and languidly past thousands of eyes which were starting from their sockets to watch
