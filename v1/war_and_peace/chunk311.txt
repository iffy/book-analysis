the stables the same expensive presents and dinner parties to the whole district on name days there were still the counts games of whist and boston at which spreading out his cards so that everybody could see them he let himself be plundered of hundreds of rubles every day by his neighbors who looked upon an opportunity to play a rubber with count rostv as a most profitable source of income the count moved in his affairs as in a huge net trying not to believe that he was entangled but becoming more and more so at every step and feeling too feeble to break the meshes or to set to work carefully and patiently to disentangle them the countess with her loving heart felt that her children were being ruined that it was not the counts fault for he could not help being what he was that though he tried to hide it he himself suffered from the consciousness of his own and his childrens ruin and she tried to find means of remedying the position from her feminine point of view she could see only one solution namely for nicholas to marry a rich heiress she felt this to be their last hope and that if nicholas refused the match she had found for him she would have to abandon the hope of ever getting matters right this match was with julie kargina the daughter of excellent and virtuous parents a girl the rostvs had known from childhood and who had now become a wealthy heiress through the death of the last of her brothers the countess had written direct to julies mother in moscow suggesting a marriage between their children and had received a favorable answer from her kargina had replied that for her part she was agreeable and everything depend on her daughters inclination she invited nicholas to come to moscow several times the countess with tears in her eyes told her son that now both her daughters were settled her only wish was to see him married she said she could lie down in her grave peacefully if that were accomplished then she told him that she knew of a splendid girl and tried to discover what he thought about marriage at other times she praised julie to him and advised him to go to moscow during the holidays to amuse himself nicholas guessed what his mothers remarks were leading to and during one of these conversations induced her to speak quite frankly she told him that her only hope of getting their affairs disentangled now lay in his marrying julie kargina but mamma suppose i loved a girl who has no fortune would you expect me to sacrifice my feelings and my honor for the sake of money he asked his mother not realizing the cruelty of his question and only wishing to show his noble-mindedness no you have not understood me said his mother not knowing how to justify herself you have not understood me niklenka it is your happiness i wish for she added feeling that she was telling an untruth and was becoming entangled she began to cry mamma dont cry only tell me that you wish it and you know i will give my life anything to put you at ease said nicholas i would sacrifice anything for you even my feelings but the countess did not want the question put like that she did not want a sacrifice from her son she herself wished to make a sacrifice for him no you have not understood me dont let us talk about it she replied wiping away her tears maybe i do love a poor girl said nicholas to himself am i to sacrifice my feelings and my honor for money i wonder how mamma could speak so to me because snya is poor i must not love her he thought must not respond to her faithful devoted love yet i should certainly be happier with her than with some doll-like julie i can always sacrifice my feelings for my familys welfare he said to himself but i cant coerce my feelings if i love snya that feeling is for me stronger and higher than all else nicholas did not go to moscow and the countess did not renew the conversation with him about marriage she saw with sorrow and sometimes with exasperation symptoms of a growing attachment between her son and the portionless snya though she blamed herself for it she could not refrain from grumbling at and worrying snya often
