but bergs chief characteristic was such a nave and good natured egotism that the rostvs involuntarily came to think it would be a good thing since he himself was so firmly convinced that it was good indeed excellent moreover the rostvs affairs were seriously embarrassed as the suitor could not but know and above all vra was twenty-four had been taken out everywhere and though she was certainly good-looking and sensible no one up to now had proposed to her so they gave their consent you see said berg to his comrade whom he called friend only because he knew that everyone has friends you see i have considered it all and should not marry if i had not thought it all out or if it were in any way unsuitable but on the contrary my papa and mamma are now provided for i have arranged that rent for them in the baltic provinces and i can live in petersburg on my pay and with her fortune and my good management we can get along nicely i am not marrying for money i consider that dishonorable but a wife should bring her share and a husband his i have my position in the service she has connections and some means in our times that is worth something isnt it but above all she is a handsome estimable girl and she loves me berg blushed and smiled and i love her because her character is sensible and very good now the other sister though they are the same family is quite different an unpleasant character and has not the same intelligence she is so you know unpleasant but my fiance well you will be coming he was going to say to dine but changed his mind and said to take tea with us and quickly doubling up his tongue he blew a small round ring of tobacco smoke perfectly embodying his dream of happiness after the first feeling of perplexity aroused in the parents by bergs proposal the holiday tone of joyousness usual at such times took possession of the family but the rejoicing was external and insincere in the familys feeling toward this wedding a certain awkwardness and constraint was evident as if they were ashamed of not having loved vra sufficiently and of being so ready to get her off their hands the old count felt this most he would probably have been unable to state the cause of his embarrassment but it resulted from the state of his affairs he did not know at all how much he had what his debts amounted to or what dowry he could give vra when his daughters were born he had assigned to each of them for her dowry an estate with three hundred serfs but one of these estates had already been sold and the other was mortgaged and the interest so much in arrears that it would have to be sold so that it was impossible to give it to vra nor had he any money berg had already been engaged a month and only a week remained before the wedding but the count had not yet decided in his own mind the question of the dowry nor spoken to his wife about it at one time the count thought of giving her the ryazn estate or of selling a forest at another time of borrowing money on a note of hand a few days before the wedding berg entered the counts study early one morning and with a pleasant smile respectfully asked his future father-in-law to let him know what vras dowry would be the count was so disconcerted by this long-foreseen inquiry that without consideration he gave the first reply that came into his head i like your being businesslike about it i like it you shall be satisfied and patting berg on the shoulder he got up wishing to end the conversation but berg smiling pleasantly explained that if he did not know for certain how much vra would have and did not receive at least part of the dowry in advance he would have to break matters off because consider count if i allowed myself to marry now without having definite means to maintain my wife i should be acting badly the conversation ended by the count who wished to be generous and to avoid further importunity saying that he would give a note of hand for eighty thousand rubles berg smiled meekly kissed the count on the shoulder and said that he was very grateful but
