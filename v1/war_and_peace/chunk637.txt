worn a persian costume had now the appearance of a most correct officer of the guards he was clean-shaven and wore a guardsmans padded coat with an order of st george at his buttonhole and a plain forage cap set straight on his head he took off his wet felt cloak in a corner of the room and without greeting anyone went up to densov and began questioning him about the matter in hand densov told him of the designs the large detachments had on the transport of the message ptya had brought and his own replies to both generals then he told him all he knew of the french detachment thats so but we must know what troops they are and their numbers said dlokhov it will be necessary to go there we cant start the affair without knowing for certain how many there are i like to work accurately here now wouldnt one of these gentlemen like to ride over to the french camp with me i have brought a spare uniform i i ill go with you cried ptya theres no need for you to go at all said densov addressing dlokhov and as for him i wont let him go on any account i like that exclaimed ptya why shouldnt i go because its useless well you must excuse me because because i shall go and thats all youll take me wont you he said turning to dlokhov why not dlokhov answered absently scrutinizing the face of the french drummer boy have you had that youngster with you long he asked densov he was taken today but he knows nothing im keeping him with me yes and where do you put the others inquired dlokhov where i send them away and take a weceipt for them shouted densov suddenly flushing and i say boldly that i have not a single mans life on my conscience would it be difficult for you to send thirty or thwee hundwed men to town under escort instead of staining i speak bluntly staining the honor of a soldier that kind of amiable talk would be suitable from this young count of sixteen said dlokhov with cold irony but its time for you to drop it why ive not said anything i only say that ill certainly go with you said ptya shyly but for you and me old fellow its time to drop these amenities continued dlokhov as if he found particular pleasure in speaking of this subject which irritated densov now why have you kept this lad he went on swaying his head because you are sorry for him dont we know those receipts of yours you send a hundred men away and thirty get there the rest either starve or get killed so isnt it all the same not to send them the esaul screwing up his light-colored eyes nodded approvingly thats not the point im not going to discuss the matter i do not wish to take it on my conscience you say theyll die all wight only not by my fault dlokhov began laughing who has told them not to capture me these twenty times over but if they did catch me theyd string me up to an aspen tree and with all your chivalry just the same he paused however we must get to work tell the cossack to fetch my kit i have two french uniforms in it well are you coming with me he asked ptya i yes yes certainly cried ptya blushing almost to tears and glancing at densov while dlokhov had been disputing with densov what should be done with prisoners ptya had once more felt awkward and restless but again he had no time to grasp fully what they were talking about if grown-up distinguished men think so it must be necessary and right thought he but above all densov must not dare to imagine that ill obey him and that he can order me about i will certainly go to the french camp with dlokhov if he can so can i and to all densovs persuasions ptya replied that he too was accustomed to do everything accurately and not just anyhow and that he never considered personal danger for youll admit that if we dont know for sure how many of them there are hundreds of lives may depend on it while there are only two of us besides i want to go very much and certainly will go so dont hinder me said he it will only make things worse
