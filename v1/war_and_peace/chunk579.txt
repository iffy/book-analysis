had drawn his particular attention to her when he met her again in vornezh the impression she made on him was not merely pleasing but powerful nicholas had been struck by the peculiar moral beauty he observed in her at this time he was however preparing to go away and it had not entered his head to regret that he was thus depriving himself of chances of meeting her but that days encounter in church had he felt sunk deeper than was desirable for his peace of mind that pale sad refined face that radiant look those gentle graceful gestures and especially the deep and tender sorrow expressed in all her features agitated him and evoked his sympathy in men rostv could not bear to see the expression of a higher spiritual life that was why he did not like prince andrew and he referred to it contemptuously as philosophy and dreaminess but in princess mary that very sorrow which revealed the depth of a whole spiritual world foreign to him was an irresistible attraction she must be a wonderful woman a real angel he said to himself why am i not free why was i in such a hurry with snya and he involuntarily compared the two the lack of spirituality in the one and the abundance of it in the other a spirituality he himself lacked and therefore valued most highly he tried to picture what would happen were he free how he would propose to her and how she would become his wife but no he could not imagine that he felt awed and no clear picture presented itself to his mind he had long ago pictured to himself a future with snya and that was all clear and simple just because it had all been thought out and he knew all there was in snya but it was impossible to picture a future with princess mary because he did not understand her but simply loved her reveries about snya had had something merry and playful in them but to dream of princess mary was always difficult and a little frightening how she prayed he thought it was plain that her whole soul was in her prayer yes that was the prayer that moves mountains and i am sure her prayer will be answered why dont i pray for what i want he suddenly thought what do i want to be free released from snya she was right he thought remembering what the governors wife had said nothing but misfortune can come of marrying snya muddles grief for mamma business difficulties muddles terrible muddles besides i dont love her not as i should o god release me from this dreadful inextricable position he suddenly began to pray yes prayer can move mountains but one must have faith and not pray as natsha and i used to as children that the snow might turn into sugar and then run out into the yard to see whether it had done so no but i am not praying for trifles now he thought as he put his pipe down in a corner and folding his hands placed himself before the icon softened by memories of princess mary he began to pray as he had not done for a long time tears were in his eyes and in his throat when the door opened and lavrshka came in with some papers blockhead why do you come in without being called cried nicholas quickly changing his attitude from the governor said lavrshka in a sleepy voice a courier has arrived and theres a letter for you well all right thanks you can go nicholas took the two letters one of which was from his mother and the other from snya he recognized them by the handwriting and opened snyas first he had read only a few lines when he turned pale and his eyes opened wide with fear and joy no its not possible he cried aloud unable to sit still he paced up and down the room holding the letter and reading it he glanced through it then read it again and then again and standing still in the middle of the room he raised his shoulders stretching out his hands with his mouth wide open and his eyes fixed what he had just been praying for with confidence that god would hear him had come to pass but nicholas was as much astonished as if it were something extraordinary and unexpected and as if the very fact that it had happened so
