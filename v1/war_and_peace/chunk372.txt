mine may finish as quickly as possible said he in the tone of a servant who wants to remain good friends with another despite a quarrel between their masters and he went on to inquiries about the grand duke and the state of his health and to reminiscences of the gay and amusing times he had spent with him in naples then suddenly as if remembering his royal dignity murat solemnly drew himself up assumed the pose in which he had stood at his coronation and waving his right arm said i wont detain you longer general i wish success to your mission and with his embroidered red mantle his flowing feathers and his glittering ornaments he rejoined his suite who were respectfully awaiting him balashv rode on supposing from murats words that he would very soon be brought before napoleon himself but instead of that at the next village the sentinels of davouts infantry corps detained him as the pickets of the vanguard had done and an adjutant of the corps commander who was fetched conducted him into the village to marshal davout chapter v davout was to napoleon what arakchev was to alexander though not a coward like arakchev he was as precise as cruel and as unable to express his devotion to his monarch except by cruelty in the organism of states such men are necessary as wolves are necessary in the organism of nature and they always exist always appear and hold their own however incongruous their presence and their proximity to the head of the government may be this inevitability alone can explain how the cruel arakchev who tore out a grenadiers mustache with his own hands whose weak nerves rendered him unable to face danger and who was neither an educated man nor a courtier was able to maintain his powerful position with alexander whose own character was chivalrous noble and gentle balashv found davout seated on a barrel in the shed of a peasants hut writing he was auditing accounts better quarters could have been found him but marshal davout was one of those men who purposely put themselves in most depressing conditions to have a justification for being gloomy for the same reason they are always hard at work and in a hurry how can i think of the bright side of life when as you see i am sitting on a barrel and working in a dirty shed the expression of his face seemed to say the chief pleasure and necessity of such men when they encounter anyone who shows animation is to flaunt their own dreary persistent activity davout allowed himself that pleasure when balashv was brought in he became still more absorbed in his task when the russian general entered and after glancing over his spectacles at balashvs face which was animated by the beauty of the morning and by his talk with murat he did not rise or even stir but scowled still more and sneered malevolently when he noticed in balashvs face the disagreeable impression this reception produced davout raised his head and coldly asked what he wanted thinking he could have been received in such a manner only because davout did not know that he was adjutant general to the emperor alexander and even his envoy to napoleon balashv hastened to inform him of his rank and mission contrary to his expectation davout after hearing him became still surlier and ruder where is your dispatch he inquired give it to me i will send it to the emperor balashv replied that he had been ordered to hand it personally to the emperor your emperors orders are obeyed in your army but here said davout you must do as youre told and as if to make the russian general still more conscious of his dependence on brute force davout sent an adjutant to call the officer on duty balashv took out the packet containing the emperors letter and laid it on the table made of a door with its hinges still hanging on it laid across two barrels davout took the packet and read the inscription you are perfectly at liberty to treat me with respect or not protested balashv but permit me to observe that i have the honor to be adjutant general to his majesty davout glanced at him silently and plainly derived pleasure from the signs of agitation and confusion which appeared on balashvs face you will be treated as is fitting said he and putting the packet in his pocket left the shed a minute
