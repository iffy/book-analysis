all were silent tshin appeared at the threshold and made his way timidly from behind the backs of the generals as he stepped past the generals in the crowded hut feeling embarrassed as he always was by the sight of his superiors he did not notice the staff of the banner and stumbled over it several of those present laughed how was it a gun was abandoned asked bagratin frowning not so much at the captain as at those who were laughing among whom zherkv laughed loudest only now when he was confronted by the stern authorities did his guilt and the disgrace of having lost two guns and yet remaining alive present themselves to tshin in all their horror he had been so excited that he had not thought about it until that moment the officers laughter confused him still more he stood before bagratin with his lower jaw trembling and was hardly able to mutter i dont know your excellency i had no men your excellency you might have taken some from the covering troops tshin did not say that there were no covering troops though that was perfectly true he was afraid of getting some other officer into trouble and silently fixed his eyes on bagratin as a schoolboy who has blundered looks at an examiner the silence lasted some time prince bagratin apparently not wishing to be severe found nothing to say the others did not venture to intervene prince andrew looked at tshin from under his brows and his fingers twitched nervously your excellency prince andrew broke the silence with his abrupt voice you were pleased to send me to captain tshins battery i went there and found two thirds of the men and horses knocked out two guns smashed and no supports at all prince bagratin and tshin looked with equal intentness at bolknski who spoke with suppressed agitation and if your excellency will allow me to express my opinion he continued we owe todays success chiefly to the action of that battery and the heroic endurance of captain tshin and his company and without awaiting a reply prince andrew rose and left the table prince bagratin looked at tshin evidently reluctant to show distrust in bolknskis emphatic opinion yet not feeling able fully to credit it bent his head and told tshin that he could go prince andrew went out with him thank you you saved me my dear fellow said tshin prince andrew gave him a look but said nothing and went away he felt sad and depressed it was all so strange so unlike what he had hoped who are they why are they here what do they want and when will all this end thought rostv looking at the changing shadows before him the pain in his arm became more and more intense irresistible drowsiness overpowered him red rings danced before his eyes and the impression of those voices and faces and a sense of loneliness merged with the physical pain it was they these soldiers wounded and unwounded it was they who were crushing weighing down and twisting the sinews and scorching the flesh of his sprained arm and shoulder to rid himself of them he closed his eyes for a moment he dozed but in that short interval innumerable things appeared to him in a dream his mother and her large white hand snyas thin little shoulders natshas eyes and laughter densov with his voice and mustache and telynin and all that affair with telynin and bogdnich that affair was the same thing as this soldier with the harsh voice and it was that affair and this soldier that were so agonizingly incessantly pulling and pressing his arm and always dragging it in one direction he tried to get away from them but they would not for an instant let his shoulder move a hairs breadth it would not ache it would be well if only they did not pull it but it was impossible to get rid of them he opened his eyes and looked up the black canopy of night hung less than a yard above the glow of the charcoal flakes of falling snow were fluttering in that light tshin had not returned the doctor had not come he was alone now except for a soldier who was sitting naked at the other side of the fire warming his thin yellow body nobody wants me thought rostv there is no one to help me or pity me yet i was once at home strong happy and loved
