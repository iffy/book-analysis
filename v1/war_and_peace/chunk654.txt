and all in the corner of the sofa tearing and twisting something with her slender nervous fingers and gazing intently and fixedly at whatever her eyes chanced to fall on this solitude exhausted and tormented her but she was in absolute need of it as soon as anyone entered she got up quickly changed her position and expression and picked up a book or some sewing evidently waiting impatiently for the intruder to go she felt all the time as if she might at any moment penetrate that on which with a terrible questioning too great for her strength her spiritual gaze was fixed one day toward the end of december natsha pale and thin dressed in a black woolen gown her plaited hair negligently twisted into a knot was crouched feet and all in the corner of her sofa nervously crumpling and smoothing out the end of her sash while she looked at a corner of the door she was gazing in the direction in which he had gone to the other side of life and that other side of life of which she had never before thought and which had formerly seemed to her so far away and improbable was now nearer and more akin and more comprehensible than this side of life where everything was either emptiness and desolation or suffering and indignity she was gazing where she knew him to be but she could not imagine him otherwise than as he had been here she now saw him again as he had been at mytshchi at tritsa and at yaroslvl she saw his face heard his voice repeated his words and her own and sometimes devised other words they might have spoken there he is lying back in an armchair in his velvet cloak leaning his head on his thin pale hand his chest is dreadfully hollow and his shoulders raised his lips are firmly closed his eyes glitter and a wrinkle comes and goes on his pale forehead one of his legs twitches just perceptibly but rapidly natsha knows that he is struggling with terrible pain what is that pain like why does he have that pain what does he feel how does it hurt him thought natsha he noticed her watching him raised his eyes and began to speak seriously one thing would be terrible said he to bind oneself forever to a suffering man it would be continual torture and he looked searchingly at her natsha as usual answered before she had time to think what she would say she said this cant go on it wont you will get well quite well she now saw him from the commencement of that scene and relived what she had then felt she recalled his long sad and severe look at those words and understood the meaning of the rebuke and despair in that protracted gaze i agreed natsha now said to herself that it would be dreadful if he always continued to suffer i said it then only because it would have been dreadful for him but he understood it differently he thought it would be dreadful for me he then still wished to live and feared death and i said it so awkwardly and stupidly i did not say what i meant i thought quite differently had i said what i thought i should have said even if he had to go on dying to die continually before my eyes i should have been happy compared with what i am now now there is nothing nobody did he know that no he did not and never will know it and now it will never never be possible to put it right and now he again seemed to be saying the same words to her only in her imagination natsha this time gave him a different answer she stopped him and said terrible for you but not for me you know that for me there is nothing in life but you and to suffer with you is the greatest happiness for me and he took her hand and pressed it as he had pressed it that terrible evening four days before his death and in her imagination she said other tender and loving words which she might have said then but only spoke now i love thee thee i love love she said convulsively pressing her hands and setting her teeth with a desperate effort she was overcome by sweet sorrow and tears were already rising in her eyes then she suddenly asked herself to whom
