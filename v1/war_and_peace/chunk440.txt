garden and kissed her head she looked up it was mademoiselle bourienne in a black dress and weepers she softly approached princess mary sighed kissed her and immediately began to cry the princess looked up at her all their former disharmony and her own jealousy recurred to her mind but she remembered too how he had changed of late toward mademoiselle bourienne and could not bear to see her thereby showing how unjust were the reproaches princess mary had mentally addressed to her besides is it for me for me who desired his death to condemn anyone she thought princess mary vividly pictured to herself the position of mademoiselle bourienne whom she had of late kept at a distance but who yet was dependent on her and living in her house she felt sorry for her and held out her hand with a glance of gentle inquiry mademoiselle bourienne at once began crying again and kissed that hand speaking of the princess sorrow and making herself a partner in it she said her only consolation was the fact that the princess allowed her to share her sorrow that all the old misunderstandings should sink into nothing but this great grief that she felt herself blameless in regard to everyone and that he from above saw her affection and gratitude the princess heard her not heeding her words but occasionally looking up at her and listening to the sound of her voice your position is doubly terrible dear princess said mademoiselle bourienne after a pause i understand that you could not and cannot think of yourself but with my love for you i must do so has alptych been to you has he spoken to you of going away she asked princess mary did not answer she did not understand who was to go or where to is it possible to plan or think of anything now is it not all the same she thought and did not reply you know chre marie said mademoiselle bourienne that we are in danger are surrounded by the french it would be dangerous to move now if we go we are almost sure to be taken prisoners and god knows princess mary looked at her companion without understanding what she was talking about oh if anyone knew how little anything matters to me now she said of course i would on no account wish to go away from him alptych did say something about going speak to him i can do nothing nothing and dont want to ive spoken to him he hopes we should be in time to get away tomorrow but i think it would now be better to stay here said mademoiselle bourienne because you will agree chre marie to fall into the hands of the soldiers or of riotous peasants would be terrible mademoiselle bourienne took from her reticule a proclamation not printed on ordinary russian paper of general rameaus telling people not to leave their homes and that the french authorities would afford them proper protection she handed this to the princess i think it would be best to appeal to that general she continued and i am sure that all due respect would be shown you princess mary read the paper and her face began to quiver with stifled sobs from whom did you get this she asked they probably recognized that i am french by my name replied mademoiselle bourienne blushing princess mary with the paper in her hand rose from the window and with a pale face went out of the room and into what had been prince andrews study dunysha send alptych or drnushka or somebody to me she said and tell mademoiselle bourienne not to come to me she added hearing mademoiselle bouriennes voice we must go at once at once she said appalled at the thought of being left in the hands of the french if prince andrew heard that i was in the power of the french that i the daughter of prince nicholas bolknski asked general rameau for protection and accepted his favor this idea horrified her made her shudder blush and feel such a rush of anger and pride as she had never experienced before all that was distressing and especially all that was humiliating in her position rose vividly to her mind they the french would settle in this house m le gnral rameau would occupy prince andrews study and amuse himself by looking through and reading his letters and papers mademoiselle bourienne would do the honors of boguchrovo for him
