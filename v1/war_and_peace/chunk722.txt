coin the biographies and special national histories are like paper money they can be used and can circulate and fulfill their purpose without harm to anyone and even advantageously as long as no one asks what is the security behind them you need only forget to ask how the will of heroes produces events and such histories as thiers will be interesting and instructive and may perhaps even possess a tinge of poetry but just as doubts of the real value of paper money arise either because being easy to make too much of it gets made or because people try to exchange it for gold so also doubts concerning the real value of such histories arise either because too many of them are written or because in his simplicity of heart someone inquires by what force did napoleon do this that is wants to exchange the current paper money for the real gold of actual comprehension the writers of universal histories and of the history of culture are like people who recognizing the defects of paper money decide to substitute for it money made of metal that has not the specific gravity of gold it may indeed make jingling coin but will do no more than that paper money may deceive the ignorant but nobody is deceived by tokens of base metal that have no value but merely jingle as gold is gold only if it is serviceable not merely for exchange but also for use so universal historians will be valuable only when they can reply to historys essential question what is power the universal historians give contradictory replies to that question while the historians of culture evade it and answer something quite different and as counters of imitation gold can be used only among a group of people who agree to accept them as gold or among those who do not know the nature of gold so universal historians and historians of culture not answering humanitys essential question serve as currency for some purposes of their own only in universities and among the mass of readers who have a taste for what they call serious reading chapter iv having abandoned the conception of the ancients as to the divine subjection of the will of a nation to some chosen man and the subjection of that mans will to the deity history cannot without contradictions take a single step till it has chosen one of two things either a return to the former belief in the direct intervention of the deity in human affairs or a definite explanation of the meaning of the force producing historical events and termed power a return to the first is impossible the belief has been destroyed and so it is essential to explain what is meant by power napoleon ordered an army to be raised and go to war we are so accustomed to that idea and have become so used to it that the question why did six hundred thousand men go to fight when napoleon uttered certain words seems to us senseless he had the power and so what he ordered was done this reply is quite satisfactory if we believe that the power was given him by god but as soon as we do not admit that it becomes essential to determine what is this power of one man over others it cannot be the direct physical power of a strong man over a weak one a domination based on the application or threat of physical force like the power of hercules nor can it be based on the effect of moral force as in their simplicity some historians think who say that the leading figures in history are heroes that is men gifted with a special strength of soul and mind called genius this power cannot be based on the predominance of moral strength for not to mention heroes such as napoleon about whose moral qualities opinions differ widely history shows us that neither a louis xi nor a metternich who ruled over millions of people had any particular moral qualities but on the contrary were generally morally weaker than any of the millions they ruled over if the source of power lies neither in the physical nor in the moral qualities of him who possesses it it must evidently be looked for elsewhere in the relation to the people of the man who wields the power and that is how power is understood by the science of jurisprudence that exchange bank of history which offers to exchange historys understanding
