to the kalga road and go to tartino which was between the roads along which those supplies lay just as it is impossible to say when it was decided to abandon moscow so it is impossible to say precisely when or by whom it was decided to move to tartino only when the army had got there as the result of innumerable and varying forces did people begin to assure themselves that they had desired this movement and long ago foreseen its result chapter ii the famous flank movement merely consisted in this after the advance of the french had ceased the russian army which had been continually retreating straight back from the invaders deviated from that direct course and not finding itself pursued was naturally drawn toward the district where supplies were abundant if instead of imagining to ourselves commanders of genius leading the russian army we picture that army without any leaders it could not have done anything but make a return movement toward moscow describing an arc in the direction where most provisions were to be found and where the country was richest that movement from the nzhni to the ryazn tla and kalga roads was so natural that even the russian marauders moved in that direction and demands were sent from petersburg for kutzov to take his army that way at tartino kutzov received what was almost a reprimand from the emperor for having moved his army along the ryazn road and the emperors letter indicated to him the very position he had already occupied near kalga having rolled like a ball in the direction of the impetus given by the whole campaign and by the battle of borodin the russian army when the strength of that impetus was exhausted and no fresh push was received assumed the position natural to it kutzovs merit lay not in any strategic maneuver of genius as it is called but in the fact that he alone understood the significance of what had happened he alone then understood the meaning of the french armys inactivity he alone continued to assert that the battle of borodin had been a victory he alone who as commander in chief might have been expected to be eager to attack employed his whole strength to restrain the russian army from useless engagements the beast wounded at borodin was lying where the fleeing hunter had left him but whether he was still alive whether he was strong and merely lying low the hunter did not know suddenly the beast was heard to moan the moan of that wounded beast the french army which betrayed its calamitous condition was the sending of lauriston to kutzovs camp with overtures for peace napoleon with his usual assurance that whatever entered his head was right wrote to kutzov the first words that occurred to him though they were meaningless monsieur le prince koutouzov i am sending one of my adjutants-general to discuss several interesting questions with you i beg your highness to credit what he says to you especially when he expresses the sentiment of esteem and special regard i have long entertained for your person this letter having no other object i pray god monsieur le prince koutouzov to keep you in his holy and gracious protection napoleon moscow october kutzov replied i should be cursed by posterity were i looked on as the initiator of a settlement of any sort such is the present spirit of my nation but he continued to exert all his powers to restrain his troops from attacking during the month that the french troops were pillaging in moscow and the russian troops were quietly encamped at tartino a change had taken place in the relative strength of the two armies both in spirit and in number as a result of which the superiority had passed to the russian side though the condition and numbers of the french army were unknown to the russians as soon as that change occurred the need of attacking at once showed itself by countless signs these signs were lauristons mission the abundance of provisions at tartino the reports coming in from all sides of the inactivity and disorder of the french the flow of recruits to our regiments the fine weather the long rest the russian soldiers had enjoyed and the impatience to do what they had been assembled for which usually shows itself in an army that has been resting curiosity as to what the french army so long lost sight of was doing the boldness with which our
