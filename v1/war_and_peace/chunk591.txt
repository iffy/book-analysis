face at such times was very serious having been taken prisoner and allowed his beard to grow he seemed to have thrown off all that had been forced upon him everything military and alien to himself and had returned to his former peasant habits a soldier on leave a shirt outside breeches he would say he did not like talking about his life as a soldier though he did not complain and often mentioned that he had not been flogged once during the whole of his army service when he related anything it was generally some old and evidently precious memory of his christian life as he called his peasant existence the proverbs of which his talk was full were for the most part not the coarse and indecent saws soldiers employ but those folk sayings which taken without a context seem so insignificant but when used appositely suddenly acquire a significance of profound wisdom he would often say the exact opposite of what he had said on a previous occasion yet both would be right he liked to talk and he talked well adorning his speech with terms of endearment and with folk sayings which pierre thought he invented himself but the chief charm of his talk lay in the fact that the commonest events sometimes just such as pierre had witnessed without taking notice of them assumed in karatevs a character of solemn fitness he liked to hear the folk tales one of the soldiers used to tell of an evening they were always the same but most of all he liked to hear stories of real life he would smile joyfully when listening to such stories now and then putting in a word or asking a question to make the moral beauty of what he was told clear to himself karatev had no attachments friendships or love as pierre understood them but loved and lived affectionately with everything life brought him in contact with particularly with man not any particular man but those with whom he happened to be he loved his dog his comrades the french and pierre who was his neighbor but pierre felt that in spite of karatevs affectionate tenderness for him by which he unconsciously gave pierres spiritual life its due he would not have grieved for a moment at parting from him and pierre began to feel in the same way toward karatev to all the other prisoners platn karatev seemed a most ordinary soldier they called him little falcon or platsha chaffed him good-naturedly and sent him on errands but to pierre he always remained what he had seemed that first night an unfathomable rounded eternal personification of the spirit of simplicity and truth platn karatev knew nothing by heart except his prayers when he began to speak he seemed not to know how he would conclude sometimes pierre struck by the meaning of his words would ask him to repeat them but platn could never recall what he had said a moment before just as he never could repeat to pierre the words of his favorite song native and birch tree and my heart is sick occurred in it but when spoken and not sung no meaning could be got out of it he did not and could not understand the meaning of words apart from their context every word and action of his was the manifestation of an activity unknown to him which was his life but his life as he regarded it had no meaning as a separate thing it had meaning only as part of a whole of which he was always conscious his words and actions flowed from him as evenly inevitably and spontaneously as fragrance exhales from a flower he could not understand the value or significance of any word or deed taken separately chapter xiv when princess mary heard from nicholas that her brother was with the rostvs at yaroslvl she at once prepared to go there in spite of her aunts efforts to dissuade her and not merely to go herself but to take her nephew with her whether it were difficult or easy possible or impossible she did not ask and did not want to know it was her duty not only to herself to be near her brother who was perhaps dying but to do everything possible to take his son to him and so she prepared to set off that she had not heard from prince andrew himself princess mary attributed to his being too weak to write or to his considering
