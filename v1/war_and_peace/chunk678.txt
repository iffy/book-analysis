seemed as if she could never finish several times she repeated the same thing twice dessalles voice was heard outside the door asking whether little nicholas might come in to say good night well thats all everything said natsha she got up quickly just as nicholas entered almost ran to the door which was hidden by curtains struck her head against it and rushed from the room with a moan either of pain or sorrow pierre gazed at the door through which she had disappeared and did not understand why he suddenly felt all alone in the world princess mary roused him from his abstraction by drawing his attention to her nephew who had entered the room at that moment of emotional tenderness young nicholas face which resembled his fathers affected pierre so much that when he had kissed the boy he got up quickly took out his handkerchief and went to the window he wished to take leave of princess mary but she would not let him go no natsha and i sometimes dont go to sleep till after two so please dont go i will order supper go downstairs we will come immediately before pierre left the room princess mary told him this is the first time she has talked of him like that chapter xvii pierre was shown into the large brightly lit dining room a few minutes later he heard footsteps and princess mary entered with natsha natsha was calm though a severe and grave expression had again settled on her face they all three of them now experienced that feeling of awkwardness which usually follows after a serious and heartfelt talk it is impossible to go back to the same conversation to talk of trifles is awkward and yet the desire to speak is there and silence seems like affectation they went silently to table the footmen drew back the chairs and pushed them up again pierre unfolded his cold table napkin and resolving to break the silence looked at natsha and at princess mary they had evidently both formed the same resolution the eyes of both shone with satisfaction and a confession that besides sorrow life also has joy do you take vodka count asked princess mary and those words suddenly banished the shadows of the past now tell us about yourself said she one hears such improbable wonders about you yes replied pierre with the smile of mild irony now habitual to him they even tell me wonders i myself never dreamed of mary abrmovna invited me to her house and kept telling me what had happened or ought to have happened to me stepn stepnych also instructed me how i ought to tell of my experiences in general i have noticed that it is very easy to be an interesting man i am an interesting man now people invite me out and tell me all about myself natsha smiled and was on the point of speaking we have been told princess mary interrupted her that you lost two millions in moscow is that true but i am three times as rich as before returned pierre though the position was now altered by his decision to pay his wifes debts and to rebuild his houses pierre still maintained that he had become three times as rich as before what i have certainly gained is freedom he began seriously but did not continue noticing that this theme was too egotistic and are you building yes savlich says i must tell me you did not know of the countess death when you decided to remain in moscow asked princess mary and immediately blushed noticing that her question following his mention of freedom ascribed to his words a meaning he had perhaps not intended no answered pierre evidently not considering awkward the meaning princess mary had given to his words i heard of it in orl and you cannot imagine how it shocked me we were not an exemplary couple he added quickly glancing at natsha and noticing on her face curiosity as to how he would speak of his wife but her death shocked me terribly when two people quarrel they are always both in fault and ones own guilt suddenly becomes terribly serious when the other is no longer alive and then such a death without friends and without consolation i am very very sorry for her he concluded and was pleased to notice a look of glad approval on natshas face yes and so you are once more an eligible bachelor said princess mary pierre
