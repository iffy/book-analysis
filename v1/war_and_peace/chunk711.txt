which can only cause harm why did the tugendbund which saved europe they did not then venture to suggest that russia had saved europe do any harm the tugendbund is an alliance of virtue it is love mutual help it is what christ preached on the cross natsha who had come in during the conversation looked joyfully at her husband it was not what he was saying that pleased her that did not even interest her for it seemed to her that was all extremely simple and that she had known it a long time it seemed so to her because she knew that it sprang from pierres whole soul but it was his animated and enthusiastic appearance that made her glad the boy with the thin neck stretching out from the turn-down collar whom everyone had forgotten gazed at pierre with even greater and more rapturous joy every word of pierres burned into his heart and with a nervous movement of his fingers he unconsciously broke the sealing wax and quill pens his hands came upon on his uncles table it is not at all what you suppose but that is what the german tugendbund was and what i am proposing no my fwiend the tugendbund is all vewy well for the sausage eaters but i dont understand it and cant even pwonounce it interposed densov in a loud and resolute voice i agwee that evewything here is wotten and howwible but the tugendbund i dont understand if were not satisfied let us have a bunt of our own thats all wight je suis vote homme im your man pierre smiled natsha began to laugh but nicholas knitted his brows still more and began proving to pierre that there was no prospect of any great change and that all the danger he spoke of existed only in his imagination pierre maintained the contrary and as his mental faculties were greater and more resourceful nicholas felt himself cornered this made him still angrier for he was fully convinced not by reasoning but by something within him stronger than reason of the justice of his opinion i will tell you this he said rising and trying with nervously twitching fingers to prop up his pipe in a corner but finally abandoning the attempt i cant prove it to you you say that everything here is rotten and that an overthrow is coming i dont see it but you also say that our oath of allegiance is a conditional matter and to that i reply you are my best friend as you know but if you formed a secret society and began working against the government be it what it may i know it is my duty to obey the government and if arakchev ordered me to lead a squadron against you and cut you down i should not hesitate an instant but should do it and you may argue about that as you like an awkward silence followed these words natsha was the first to speak defending her husband and attacking her brother her defense was weak and inapt but she attained her object the conversation was resumed and no longer in the unpleasantly hostile tone of nicholas last remark when they all got up to go in to supper little nicholas bolknski went up to pierre pale and with shining radiant eyes uncle pierre you no if papa were alive would he agree with you he asked and pierre suddenly realized what a special independent complex and powerful process of thought and feeling must have been going on in this boy during that conversation and remembering all he had said he regretted that the lad should have heard him he had however to give him an answer yes i think so he said reluctantly and left the study the lad looked down and seemed now for the first time to notice what he had done to the things on the table he flushed and went up to nicholas uncle forgive me i did that unintentionally he said pointing to the broken sealing wax and pens nicholas started angrily all right all right he said throwing the bits under the table and evidently suppressing his vexation with difficulty he turned away from the boy you ought not to have been here at all he said chapter xv the conversation at supper was not about politics or societies but turned on the subject nicholas liked best recollections of densov started these and pierre was particularly agreeable and amusing about them the family separated on
