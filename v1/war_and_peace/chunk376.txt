bernadotte who promptly went mad for no swede would ally himself with russia unless he were mad napoleon grinned maliciously and again raised his snuffbox to his nose balashv knew how to reply to each of napoleons remarks and would have done so he continually made the gesture of a man wishing to say something but napoleon always interrupted him to the alleged insanity of the swedes balashv wished to reply that when russia is on her side sweden is practically an island but napoleon gave an angry exclamation to drown his voice napoleon was in that state of irritability in which a man has to talk talk and talk merely to convince himself that he is in the right balashv began to feel uncomfortable as envoy he feared to demean his dignity and felt the necessity of replying but as a man he shrank before the transport of groundless wrath that had evidently seized napoleon he knew that none of the words now uttered by napoleon had any significance and that napoleon himself would be ashamed of them when he came to his senses balashv stood with downcast eyes looking at the movements of napoleons stout legs and trying to avoid meeting his eyes but what do i care about your allies said napoleon i have allies the poles there are eighty thousand of them and they fight like lions and there will be two hundred thousand of them and probably still more perturbed by the fact that he had uttered this obvious falsehood and that balashv still stood silently before him in the same attitude of submission to fate napoleon abruptly turned round drew close to balashvs face and gesticulating rapidly and energetically with his white hands almost shouted know that if you stir up prussia against me ill wipe it off the map of europe he declared his face pale and distorted by anger and he struck one of his small hands energetically with the other yes i will throw you back beyond the dvna and beyond the dnieper and will re-erect against you that barrier which it was criminal and blind of europe to allow to be destroyed yes that is what will happen to you that is what you have gained by alienating me and he walked silently several times up and down the room his fat shoulders twitching he put his snuffbox into his waistcoat pocket took it out again lifted it several times to his nose and stopped in front of balashv he paused looked ironically straight into balashvs eyes and said in a quiet voice and yet what a splendid reign your master might have had balashv feeling it incumbent on him to reply said that from the russian side things did not appear in so gloomy a light napoleon was silent still looking derisively at him and evidently not listening to him balashv said that in russia the best results were expected from the war napoleon nodded condescendingly as if to say i know its your duty to say that but you dont believe it yourself i have convinced you when balashv had ended napoleon again took out his snuffbox sniffed at it and stamped his foot twice on the floor as a signal the door opened a gentleman-in-waiting bending respectfully handed the emperor his hat and gloves another brought him a pocket handkerchief napoleon without giving them a glance turned to balashv assure the emperor alexander from me said he taking his hat that i am as devoted to him as before i know him thoroughly and very highly esteem his lofty qualities i will detain you no longer general you shall receive my letter to the emperor and napoleon went quickly to the door everyone in the reception room rushed forward and descended the staircase chapter vii after all that napoleon had said to him those bursts of anger and the last dryly spoken words i will detain you no longer general you shall receive my letter balashv felt convinced that napoleon would not wish to see him and would even avoid another meeting with him an insulted envoy especially as he had witnessed his unseemly anger but to his surprise balashv received through duroc an invitation to dine with the emperor that day bessires caulaincourt and berthier were present at that dinner napoleon met balashv cheerfully and amiably he not only showed no sign of constraint or self-reproach on account of his outburst that morning but on the contrary tried to reassure balashv it was evident that he had long
