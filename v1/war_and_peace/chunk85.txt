suite well it seems that no one has noticed thought rostv and this was true no one had taken any notice for everyone knew the sensation which the cadet under fire for the first time had experienced heres something for you to report said zherkv see if i dont get promoted to a sublieutenancy inform the prince that i the bridge fired said the colonel triumphantly and gaily and if he asks about the losses a trifle said the colonel in his bass voice two hussars wounded and one knocked out he added unable to restrain a happy smile and pronouncing the phrase knocked out with ringing distinctness chapter ix pursued by the french army of a hundred thousand men under the command of bonaparte encountering a population that was unfriendly to it losing confidence in its allies suffering from shortness of supplies and compelled to act under conditions of war unlike anything that had been foreseen the russian army of thirty-five thousand men commanded by kutzov was hurriedly retreating along the danube stopping where overtaken by the enemy and fighting rearguard actions only as far as necessary to enable it to retreat without losing its heavy equipment there had been actions at lambach amstetten and melk but despite the courage and endurance acknowledged even by the enemy with which the russians fought the only consequence of these actions was a yet more rapid retreat austrian troops that had escaped capture at ulm and had joined kutzov at braunau now separated from the russian army and kutzov was left with only his own weak and exhausted forces the defense of vienna was no longer to be thought of instead of an offensive the plan of which carefully prepared in accord with the modern science of strategics had been handed to kutzov when he was in vienna by the austrian hofkriegsrath the sole and almost unattainable aim remaining for him was to effect a junction with the forces that were advancing from russia without losing his army as mack had done at ulm on the twenty-eighth of october kutzov with his army crossed to the left bank of the danube and took up a position for the first time with the river between himself and the main body of the french on the thirtieth he attacked mortiers division which was on the left bank and broke it up in this action for the first time trophies were taken banners cannon and two enemy generals for the first time after a fortnights retreat the russian troops had halted and after a fight had not only held the field but had repulsed the french though the troops were ill-clad exhausted and had lost a third of their number in killed wounded sick and stragglers though a number of sick and wounded had been abandoned on the other side of the danube with a letter in which kutzov entrusted them to the humanity of the enemy and though the big hospitals and the houses in krems converted into military hospitals could no longer accommodate all the sick and wounded yet the stand made at krems and the victory over mortier raised the spirits of the army considerably throughout the whole army and at headquarters most joyful though erroneous rumors were rife of the imaginary approach of columns from russia of some victory gained by the austrians and of the retreat of the frightened bonaparte prince andrew during the battle had been in attendance on the austrian general schmidt who was killed in the action his horse had been wounded under him and his own arm slightly grazed by a bullet as a mark of the commander in chiefs special favor he was sent with the news of this victory to the austrian court now no longer at vienna which was threatened by the french but at brnn despite his apparently delicate build prince andrew could endure physical fatigue far better than many very muscular men and on the night of the battle having arrived at krems excited but not weary with dispatches from dokhtrov to kutzov he was sent immediately with a special dispatch to brnn to be so sent meant not only a reward but an important step toward promotion the night was dark but starry the road showed black in the snow that had fallen the previous day the day of the battle reviewing his impressions of the recent battle picturing pleasantly to himself the impression his news of a victory would create or recalling the send-off given him by the commander in chief and
