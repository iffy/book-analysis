the most friendly terms after supper nicholas having undressed in his study and given instructions to the steward who had been waiting for him went to the bedroom in his dressing gown where he found his wife still at her table writing what are you writing mary nicholas asked countess mary blushed she was afraid that what she was writing would not be understood or approved by her husband she had wanted to conceal what she was writing from him but at the same time was glad he had surprised her at it and that she would now have to tell him a diary nicholas she replied handing him a blue exercise book filled with her firm bold writing a diary nicholas repeated with a shade of irony and he took up the book it was in french december today when andrsha her eldest boy woke up he did not wish to dress and mademoiselle louise sent for me he was naughty and obstinate i tried threats but he only grew angrier then i took the matter in hand i left him alone and began with nurses help to get the other children up telling him that i did not love him for a long time he was silent as if astonished then he jumped out of bed ran to me in his shirt and sobbed so that i could not calm him for a long time it was plain that what troubled him most was that he had grieved me afterwards in the evening when i gave him his ticket he again began crying piteously and kissing me one can do anything with him by tenderness what is a ticket nicholas inquired i have begun giving the elder ones marks every evening showing how they have behaved nicholas looked into the radiant eyes that were gazing at him and continued to turn over the pages and read in the diary was set down everything in the childrens lives that seemed noteworthy to their mother as showing their characters or suggesting general reflections on educational methods they were for the most part quite insignificant trifles but did not seem so to the mother or to the father either now that he read this diary about his children for the first time under the date was entered mtya was naughty at table papa said he was to have no pudding he had none but looked so unhappily and greedily at the others while they were eating i think that punishment by depriving children of sweets only develops their greediness must tell nicholas this nicholas put down the book and looked at his wife the radiant eyes gazed at him questioningly would he approve or disapprove of her diary there could be no doubt not only of his approval but also of his admiration for his wife perhaps it need not be done so pedantically thought nicholas or even done at all but this untiring continual spiritual effort of which the sole aim was the childrens moral welfare delighted him had nicholas been able to analyze his feelings he would have found that his steady tender and proud love of his wife rested on his feeling of wonder at her spirituality and at the lofty moral world almost beyond his reach in which she had her being he was proud of her intelligence and goodness recognized his own insignificance beside her in the spiritual world and rejoiced all the more that she with such a soul not only belonged to him but was part of himself i quite quite approve my dearest said he with a significant look and after a short pause he added and i behaved badly today you werent in the study we began disputing pierre and i and i lost my temper but he is impossible such a child i dont know what would become of him if natsha didnt keep him in hand have you any idea why he went to petersburg they have formed yes i know said countess mary natsha told me well then you know nicholas went on growing hot at the mere recollection of their discussion he wanted to convince me that it is every honest mans duty to go against the government and that the oath of allegiance and duty i am sorry you werent there they all fell on me densov and natsha natsha is absurd how she rules over him and yet there need only be a discussion and she has no words of her own but only repeats his sayings added
