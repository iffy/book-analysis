kutzov decided to abandon the road connecting him with the troops arriving from russia he would have to march with no road into unknown parts of the bohemian mountains defending himself against superior forces of the enemy and abandoning all hope of a junction with buxhwden if kutzov decided to retreat along the road from krems to olmtz to unite with the troops arriving from russia he risked being forestalled on that road by the french who had crossed the vienna bridge and encumbered by his baggage and transport having to accept battle on the march against an enemy three times as strong who would hem him in from two sides kutzov chose this latter course the french the spy reported having crossed the vienna bridge were advancing by forced marches toward znaim which lay sixty-six miles off on the line of kutzovs retreat if he reached znaim before the french there would be great hope of saving the army to let the french forestall him at znaim meant the exposure of his whole army to a disgrace such as that of ulm or to utter destruction but to forestall the french with his whole army was impossible the road for the french from vienna to znaim was shorter and better than the road for the russians from krems to znaim the night he received the news kutzov sent bagratins vanguard four thousand strong to the right across the hills from the krems-znaim to the vienna-znaim road bagratin was to make this march without resting and to halt facing vienna with znaim to his rear and if he succeeded in forestalling the french he was to delay them as long as possible kutzov himself with all his transport took the road to znaim marching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills with his hungry ill-shod soldiers and losing a third of his men as stragglers by the way bagratin came out on the vienna-znaim road at hollabrnn a few hours ahead of the french who were approaching hollabrnn from vienna kutzov with his transport had still to march for some days before he could reach znaim hence bagratin with his four thousand hungry exhausted men would have to detain for days the whole enemy army that came upon him at hollabrnn which was clearly impossible but a freak of fate made the impossible possible the success of the trick that had placed the vienna bridge in the hands of the french without a fight led murat to try to deceive kutzov in a similar way meeting bagratins weak detachment on the znaim road he supposed it to be kutzovs whole army to be able to crush it absolutely he awaited the arrival of the rest of the troops who were on their way from vienna and with this object offered a three days truce on condition that both armies should remain in position without moving murat declared that negotiations for peace were already proceeding and that he therefore offered this truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed count nostitz the austrian general occupying the advanced posts believed murats emissary and retired leaving bagratins division exposed another emissary rode to the russian line to announce the peace negotiations and to offer the russian army the three days truce bagratin replied that he was not authorized either to accept or refuse a truce and sent his adjutant to kutzov to report the offer he had received a truce was kutzovs sole chance of gaining time giving bagratins exhausted troops some rest and letting the transport and heavy convoys whose movements were concealed from the french advance if but one stage nearer znaim the offer of a truce gave the only and a quite unexpected chance of saving the army on receiving the news he immediately dispatched adjutant general wintzingerode who was in attendance on him to the enemy camp wintzingerode was not merely to agree to the truce but also to offer terms of capitulation and meanwhile kutzov sent his adjutants back to hasten to the utmost the movements of the baggage trains of the entire army along the krems-znaim road bagratins exhausted and hungry detachment which alone covered this movement of the transport and of the whole army had to remain stationary in face of an enemy eight times as strong as itself kutzovs expectations that the proposals of capitulation which were in no way binding might give time for part of the transport to pass and also that murats mistake would very soon be discovered proved correct as soon as bonaparte who was
