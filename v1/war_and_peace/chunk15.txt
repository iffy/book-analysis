say about me said pierre his face relaxing into a careless merry smile what am i an illegitimate son he suddenly blushed crimson and it was plain that he had made a great effort to say this without a name and without means and it really but he did not say what it really was for the present i am free and am all right only i havent the least idea what i am to do i wanted to consult you seriously prince andrew looked kindly at him yet his glance friendly and affectionate as it was expressed a sense of his own superiority i am fond of you especially as you are the one live man among our whole set yes youre all right choose what you will its all the same youll be all right anywhere but look here give up visiting those kurgins and leading that sort of life it suits you so badly all this debauchery dissipation and the rest of it what would you have my dear fellow answered pierre shrugging his shoulders women my dear fellow women i dont understand it replied prince andrew women who are comme il faut thats a different matter but the kurgins set of women women and wine i dont understand pierre was staying at prince vasli kurgins and sharing the dissipated life of his son anatole the son whom they were planning to reform by marrying him to prince andrews sister do you know said pierre as if suddenly struck by a happy thought seriously i have long been thinking of it leading such a life i cant decide or think properly about anything ones head aches and one spends all ones money he asked me for tonight but i wont go you give me your word of honor not to go on my honor chapter ix it was past one oclock when pierre left his friend it was a cloudless northern summer night pierre took an open cab intending to drive straight home but the nearer he drew to the house the more he felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night it was light enough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like morning or evening than night on the way pierre remembered that anatole kurgin was expecting the usual set for cards that evening after which there was generally a drinking bout finishing with visits of a kind pierre was very fond of i should like to go to kurgins thought he but he immediately recalled his promise to prince andrew not to go there then as happens to people of weak character he desired so passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to that he decided to go the thought immediately occurred to him that his promise to prince andrew was of no account because before he gave it he had already promised prince anatole to come to his gathering besides thought he all such words of honor are conventional things with no definite meaning especially if one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead or something so extraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all the same pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort nullifying all his decisions and intentions he went to kurgins reaching the large house near the horse guards barracks in which anatole lived pierre entered the lighted porch ascended the stairs and went in at the open door there was no one in the anteroom empty bottles cloaks and overshoes were lying about there was a smell of alcohol and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance cards and supper were over but the visitors had not yet dispersed pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room in which were the remains of supper a footman thinking no one saw him was drinking on the sly what was left in the glasses from the third room came sounds of laughter the shouting of familiar voices the growling of a bear and general commotion some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously round an open window three others were romping with a young bear one pulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the others i bet a hundred on stevens shouted one mind no holding on cried another i bet on dlokhov cried a third kurgin you part our hands there leave bruin alone heres a bet on at one draught or he loses shouted a
