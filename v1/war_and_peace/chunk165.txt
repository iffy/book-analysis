a third was striking the horse kutzov himself rode having by a great effort got away to the left from that flood of men kutzov with his suite diminished by more than half rode toward a sound of artillery fire near by having forced his way out of the crowd of fugitives prince andrew trying to keep near kutzov saw on the slope of the hill amid the smoke a russian battery that was still firing and frenchmen running toward it higher up stood some russian infantry neither moving forward to protect the battery nor backward with the fleeing crowd a mounted general separated himself from the infantry and approached kutzov of kutzovs suite only four remained they were all pale and exchanged looks in silence stop those wretches gasped kutzov to the regimental commander pointing to the flying soldiers but at that instant as if to punish him for those words bullets flew hissing across the regiment and across kutzovs suite like a flock of little birds the french had attacked the battery and seeing kutzov were firing at him after this volley the regimental commander clutched at his leg several soldiers fell and a second lieutenant who was holding the flag let it fall from his hands it swayed and fell but caught on the muskets of the nearest soldiers the soldiers started firing without orders oh oh oh groaned kutzov despairingly and looked around bolknski he whispered his voice trembling from a consciousness of the feebleness of age bolknski he whispered pointing to the disordered battalion and at the enemy whats that but before he had finished speaking prince andrew feeling tears of shame and anger choking him had already leapt from his horse and run to the standard forward lads he shouted in a voice piercing as a childs here it is thought he seizing the staff of the standard and hearing with pleasure the whistle of bullets evidently aimed at him several soldiers fell hurrah shouted prince andrew and scarcely able to hold up the heavy standard he ran forward with full confidence that the whole battalion would follow him and really he only ran a few steps alone one soldier moved and then another and soon the whole battalion ran forward shouting hurrah and overtook him a sergeant of the battalion ran up and took the flag that was swaying from its weight in prince andrews hands but he was immediately killed prince andrew again seized the standard and dragging it by the staff ran on with the battalion in front he saw our artillerymen some of whom were fighting while others having abandoned their guns were running toward him he also saw french infantry soldiers who were seizing the artillery horses and turning the guns round prince andrew and the battalion were already within twenty paces of the cannon he heard the whistle of bullets above him unceasingly and to right and left of him soldiers continually groaned and dropped but he did not look at them he looked only at what was going on in front of him at the battery he now saw clearly the figure of a red-haired gunner with his shako knocked awry pulling one end of a mop while a french soldier tugged at the other he could distinctly see the distraught yet angry expression on the faces of these two men who evidently did not realize what they were doing what are they about thought prince andrew as he gazed at them why doesnt the red-haired gunner run away as he is unarmed why doesnt the frenchman stab him he will not get away before the frenchman remembers his bayonet and stabs him and really another french soldier trailing his musket ran up to the struggling men and the fate of the red-haired gunner who had triumphantly secured the mop and still did not realize what awaited him was about to be decided but prince andrew did not see how it ended it seemed to him as though one of the soldiers near him hit him on the head with the full swing of a bludgeon it hurt a little but the worst of it was that the pain distracted him and prevented his seeing what he had been looking at whats this am i falling my legs are giving way thought he and fell on his back he opened his eyes hoping to see how the struggle of the frenchmen with the gunners ended whether the red-haired gunner had been killed or not and whether the cannon had
