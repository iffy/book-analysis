the report the general put before him for signature a paper relating to the recovery of payment from army commanders for green oats mown down by the soldiers when landowners lodged petitions for compensation after hearing the matter kutzov smacked his lips together and shook his head into the stove into the fire with it i tell you once for all my dear fellow said he into the fire with all such things let them cut the crops and burn wood to their hearts content i dont order it or allow it but i dont exact compensation either one cant get on without it when wood is chopped the chips will fly he looked at the paper again oh this german precision he muttered shaking his head chapter xvi well thats all said kutzov as he signed the last of the documents and rising heavily and smoothing out the folds in his fat white neck he moved toward the door with a more cheerful expression the priests wife flushing rosy red caught up the dish she had after all not managed to present at the right moment though she had so long been preparing for it and with a low bow offered it to kutzov he screwed up his eyes smiled lifted her chin with his hand and said ah what a beauty thank you sweetheart he took some gold pieces from his trouser pocket and put them on the dish for her well my dear and how are we getting on he asked moving to the door of the room assigned to him the priests wife smiled and with dimples in her rosy cheeks followed him into the room the adjutant came out to the porch and asked prince andrew to lunch with him half an hour later prince andrew was again called to kutzov he found him reclining in an armchair still in the same unbuttoned overcoat he had in his hand a french book which he closed as prince andrew entered marking the place with a knife prince andrew saw by the cover that it was les chevaliers du cygne by madame de genlis well sit down sit down here lets have a talk said kutzov its sad very sad but remember my dear fellow that i am a father to you a second father prince andrew told kutzov all he knew of his fathers death and what he had seen at bald hills when he passed through it what what they have brought us to kutzov suddenly cried in an agitated voice evidently picturing vividly to himself from prince andrews story the condition russia was in but give me time give me time he said with a grim look evidently not wishing to continue this agitating conversation and added i sent for you to keep you with me i thank your serene highness but i fear i am no longer fit for the staff replied prince andrew with a smile which kutzov noticed kutzov glanced inquiringly at him but above all added prince andrew i have grown used to my regiment am fond of the officers and i fancy the men also like me i should be sorry to leave the regiment if i decline the honor of being with you believe me a shrewd kindly yet subtly derisive expression lit up kutzovs podgy face he cut bolknski short i am sorry for i need you but youre right youre right its not here that men are needed advisers are always plentiful but men are not the regiments would not be what they are if the would-be advisers served there as you do i remember you at austerlitz i remember yes i remember you with the standard said kutzov and a flush of pleasure suffused prince andrews face at this recollection taking his hand and drawing him downwards kutzov offered his cheek to be kissed and again prince andrew noticed tears in the old mans eyes though prince andrew knew that kutzovs tears came easily and that he was particularly tender to and considerate of him from a wish to show sympathy with his loss yet this reminder of austerlitz was both pleasant and flattering to him go your way and god be with you i know your path is the path of honor he paused i missed you at bucharest but i needed someone to send and changing the subject kutzov began to speak of the turkish war and the peace that had been concluded yes i have been much blamed he said both for that war
