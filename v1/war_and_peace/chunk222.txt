and sedmortzki and all that the peasants had has been eaten up i myself will remain in hospital at ostrolenka till i recover in regard to which i humbly submit my report with the information that if the army remains in its present bivouac another fortnight there will not be a healthy man left in it by spring grant leave to retire to his country seat to an old man who is already in any case dishonored by being unable to fulfill the great and glorious task for which he was chosen i shall await your most gracious permission here in hospital that i may not have to play the part of a secretary rather than commander in the army my removal from the army does not produce the slightest stir a blind man has left it there are thousands such as i in russia the field marshal is angry with the emperor and he punishes us all isnt it logical this is the first act those that follow are naturally increasingly interesting and entertaining after the field marshals departure it appears that we are within sight of the enemy and must give battle buxhwden is commander in chief by seniority but general bennigsen does not quite see it more particularly as it is he and his corps who are within sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit by the opportunity to fight a battle on his own hand as the germans say he does so this is the battle of pultsk which is considered a great victory but in my opinion was nothing of the kind we civilians as you know have a very bad way of deciding whether a battle was won or lost those who retreat after a battle have lost it is what we say and according to that it is we who lost the battle of pultsk in short we retreat after the battle but send a courier to petersburg with news of a victory and general bennigsen hoping to receive from petersburg the post of commander in chief as a reward for his victory does not give up the command of the army to general buxhwden during this interregnum we begin a very original and interesting series of maneuvers our aim is no longer as it should be to avoid or attack the enemy but solely to avoid general buxhwden who by right of seniority should be our chief so energetically do we pursue this aim that after crossing an unfordable river we burn the bridges to separate ourselves from our enemy who at the moment is not bonaparte but buxhwden general buxhwden was all but attacked and captured by a superior enemy force as a result of one of these maneuvers that enabled us to escape him buxhwden pursues us we scuttle he hardly crosses the river to our side before we recross to the other at last our enemy buxhwden catches us and attacks both generals are angry and the result is a challenge on buxhwdens part and an epileptic fit on bennigsens but at the critical moment the courier who carried the news of our victory at pultsk to petersburg returns bringing our appointment as commander in chief and our first foe buxhwden is vanquished we can now turn our thoughts to the second bonaparte but as it turns out just at that moment a third enemy rises before us namely the orthodox russian soldiers loudly demanding bread meat biscuits fodder and whatnot the stores are empty the roads impassable the orthodox begin looting and in a way of which our last campaign can give you no idea half the regiments form bands and scour the countryside and put everything to fire and sword the inhabitants are totally ruined the hospitals overflow with sick and famine is everywhere twice the marauders even attack our headquarters and the commander in chief has to ask for a battalion to disperse them during one of these attacks they carried off my empty portmanteau and my dressing gown the emperor proposes to give all commanders of divisions the right to shoot marauders but i much fear this will oblige one half the army to shoot the other at first prince andrew read with his eyes only but after a while in spite of himself although he knew how far it was safe to trust bilbin what he had read began to interest him more and more when he had read thus far he crumpled the letter up and threw it away it was not what
