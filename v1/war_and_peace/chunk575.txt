were there immediately withdrew so as not to be in her way do you know dear boy began the governors wife with a serious expression on her kind little face that really would be the match for you would you like me to arrange it whom do you mean aunt asked nicholas i will make a match for you with the princess catherine petrvna speaks of lily but i say no the princess do you want me to do it i am sure your mother will be grateful to me what a charming girl she is really and she is not at all so plain either not at all replied nicholas as if offended at the idea as befits a soldier aunt i dont force myself on anyone or refuse anything he said before he had time to consider what he was saying well then remember this is not a joke of course not yes yes the governors wife said as if talking to herself but my dear boy among other things you are too attentive to the other the blonde one is sorry for the husband really oh no we are good friends with him said nicholas in the simplicity of his heart it did not enter his head that a pastime so pleasant to himself might not be pleasant to someone else but what nonsense i have been saying to the governors wife thought nicholas suddenly at supper she will really begin to arrange a match and snya and on taking leave of the governors wife when she again smilingly said to him well then remember he drew her aside but see here to tell the truth aunt what is it my dear come lets sit down here said she nicholas suddenly felt a desire and need to tell his most intimate thoughts which he would not have told to his mother his sister or his friend to this woman who was almost a stranger when he afterwards recalled that impulse to unsolicited and inexplicable frankness which had very important results for him it seemed to him as it seems to everyone in such cases that it was merely some silly whim that seized him yet that burst of frankness together with other trifling events had immense consequences for him and for all his family you see aunt mamma has long wanted me to marry an heiress but the very idea of marrying for money is repugnant to me oh yes i understand said the governors wife but princess bolknskaya thats another matter i will tell you the truth in the first place i like her very much i feel drawn to her and then after i met her under such circumstances so strangely the idea often occurred to me this is fate especially if you remember that mamma had long been thinking of it but i had never happened to meet her before somehow it had always happened that we did not meet and as long as my sister natsha was engaged to her brother it was of course out of the question for me to think of marrying her and it must needs happen that i should meet her just when natshas engagement had been broken off and then everything so you see i never told this to anyone and never will only to you the governors wife pressed his elbow gratefully you know snya my cousin i love her and promised to marry her and will do so so you see there can be no question about said nicholas incoherently and blushing my dear boy what a way to look at it you know snya has nothing and you yourself say your papas affairs are in a very bad way and what about your mother it would kill her thats one thing and what sort of life would it be for snya if shes a girl with a heart your mother in despair and you all ruined no my dear you and snya ought to understand that nicholas remained silent it comforted him to hear these arguments all the same aunt it is impossible he rejoined with a sigh after a short pause besides would the princess have me and besides she is now in mourning how can one think of it but you dont suppose im going to get you married at once there is always a right way of doing things replied the governors wife what a matchmaker you are aunt said nicholas kissing her plump little hand chapter vi on reaching moscow after her
