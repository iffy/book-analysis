still following pfuel out of the room when count bennigsen entered hurriedly and nodding to bolknski but not pausing went into the study giving instructions to his adjutant as he went the emperor was following him and bennigsen had hastened on to make some preparations and to be ready to receive the sovereign chernshev and prince andrew went out into the porch where the emperor who looked fatigued was dismounting marquis paulucci was talking to him with particular warmth and the emperor with his head bent to the left was listening with a dissatisfied air the emperor moved forward evidently wishing to end the conversation but the flushed and excited italian oblivious of decorum followed him and continued to speak and as for the man who advised forming this camp the drissa camp said paulucci as the emperor mounted the steps and noticing prince andrew scanned his unfamiliar face as to that person sire continued paulucci desperately apparently unable to restrain himself the man who advised the drissa camp i see no alternative but the lunatic asylum or the gallows without heeding the end of the italians remarks and as though not hearing them the emperor recognizing bolknski addressed him graciously i am very glad to see you go in there where they are meeting and wait for me the emperor went into the study he was followed by prince peter mikhylovich volknski and baron stein and the door closed behind them prince andrew taking advantage of the emperors permission accompanied paulucci whom he had known in turkey into the drawing room where the council was assembled prince peter mikhylovich volknski occupied the position as it were of chief of the emperors staff he came out of the study into the drawing room with some maps which he spread on a table and put questions on which he wished to hear the opinion of the gentlemen present what had happened was that news which afterwards proved to be false had been received during the night of a movement by the french to outflank the drissa camp the first to speak was general armfeldt who to meet the difficulty that presented itself unexpectedly proposed a perfectly new position away from the petersburg and moscow roads the reason for this was inexplicable unless he wished to show that he too could have an opinion but he urged that at this point the army should unite and there await the enemy it was plain that armfeldt had thought out that plan long ago and now expounded it not so much to answer the questions put which in fact his plan did not answer as to avail himself of the opportunity to air it it was one of the millions of proposals one as good as another that could be made as long as it was quite unknown what character the war would take some disputed his arguments others defended them young count toll objected to the swedish generals views more warmly than anyone else and in the course of the dispute drew from his side pocket a well-filled notebook which he asked permission to read to them in these voluminous notes toll suggested another scheme totally different from armfeldts or pfuels plan of campaign in answer to toll paulucci suggested an advance and an attack which he urged could alone extricate us from the present uncertainty and from the trap as he called the drissa camp in which we were situated during all these discussions pfuel and his interpreter wolzogen his bridge in court relations were silent pfuel only snorted contemptuously and turned away to show that he would never demean himself by replying to such nonsense as he was now hearing so when prince volknski who was in the chair called on him to give his opinion he merely said why ask me general armfeldt has proposed a splendid position with an exposed rear or why not this italian gentlemans attack very fine or a retreat also good why ask me said he why you yourselves know everything better than i do but when volknski said with a frown that it was in the emperors name that he asked his opinion pfuel rose and suddenly growing animated began to speak everything has been spoiled everything muddled everybody thought they knew better than i did and now you come to me how mend matters there is nothing to mend the principles laid down by me must be strictly adhered to said he drumming on the table with his bony fingers what is the difficulty nonsense
