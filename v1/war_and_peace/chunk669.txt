and this embrace too owing to a long-standing impression related to his innermost feelings had its usual effect on kutzov and he gave a sob the emperor greeted the officers and the semnov guard and again pressing the old mans hand went with him into the castle when alone with the field marshal the emperor expressed his dissatisfaction at the slowness of the pursuit and at the mistakes made at krsnoe and the berzina and informed him of his intentions for a future campaign abroad kutzov made no rejoinder or remark the same submissive expressionless look with which he had listened to the emperors commands on the field of austerlitz seven years before settled on his face now when kutzov came out of the study and with lowered head was crossing the ballroom with his heavy waddling gait he was arrested by someones voice saying your serene highness kutzov raised his head and looked for a long while into the eyes of count tolsty who stood before him holding a silver salver on which lay a small object kutzov seemed not to understand what was expected of him suddenly he seemed to remember a scarcely perceptible smile flashed across his puffy face and bowing low and respectfully he took the object that lay on the salver it was the order of st george of the first class chapter xi next day the field marshal gave a dinner and ball which the emperor honored by his presence kutzov had received the order of st george of the first class and the emperor showed him the highest honors but everyone knew of the imperial dissatisfaction with him the proprieties were observed and the emperor was the first to set that example but everybody understood that the old man was blameworthy and good-for-nothing when kutzov conforming to a custom of catherines day ordered the standards that had been captured to be lowered at the emperors feet on his entering the ballroom the emperor made a wry face and muttered something in which some people caught the words the old comedian the emperors displeasure with kutzov was specially increased at vlna by the fact that kutzov evidently could not or would not understand the importance of the coming campaign when on the following morning the emperor said to the officers assembled about him you have not only saved russia you have saved europe they all understood that the war was not ended kutzov alone would not see this and openly expressed his opinion that no fresh war could improve the position or add to the glory of russia but could only spoil and lower the glorious position that russia had gained he tried to prove to the emperor the impossibility of levying fresh troops spoke of the hardships already endured by the people of the possibility of failure and so forth this being the field marshals frame of mind he was naturally regarded as merely a hindrance and obstacle to the impending war to avoid unpleasant encounters with the old man the natural method was to do what had been done with him at austerlitz and with barclay at the beginning of the russian campaign to transfer the authority to the emperor himself thus cutting the ground from under the commander in chiefs feet without upsetting the old man by informing him of the change with this object his staff was gradually reconstructed and its real strength removed and transferred to the emperor toll konovntsyn and ermlov received fresh appointments everyone spoke loudly of the field marshals great weakness and failing health his health had to be bad for his place to be taken away and given to another and in fact his health was poor so naturally simply and gradually just as he had come from turkey to the treasury in petersburg to recruit the militia and then to the army when he was needed there now when his part was played out kutzovs place was taken by a new and necessary performer the war of besides its national significance dear to every russian heart was now to assume another a european significance the movement of peoples from west to east was to be succeeded by a movement of peoples from east to west and for this fresh war another leader was necessary having qualities and views differing from kutzovs and animated by different motives alexander i was as necessary for the movement of the peoples from east to west and for the refixing of national frontiers as kutzov had been for the salvation and
