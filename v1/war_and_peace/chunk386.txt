been hastily brushed smooth in front of the temples but stuck up behind in quaint little tufts he entered the room looking restlessly and angrily around as if afraid of everything in that large apartment awkwardly holding up his sword he addressed chernshev and asked in german where the emperor was one could see that he wished to pass through the rooms as quickly as possible finish with the bows and greetings and sit down to business in front of a map where he would feel at home he nodded hurriedly in reply to chernshev and smiled ironically on hearing that the sovereign was inspecting the fortifications that he pfuel had planned in accord with his theory he muttered something to himself abruptly and in a bass voice as self-assured germans do it might have been stupid fellow or the whole affair will be ruined or something absurd will come of it prince andrew did not catch what he said and would have passed on but chernshev introduced him to pfuel remarking that prince andrew was just back from turkey where the war had terminated so fortunately pfuel barely glanced not so much at prince andrew as past him and said with a laugh that must have been a fine tactical war and laughing contemptuously went on into the room from which the sound of voices was heard pfuel always inclined to be irritably sarcastic was particularly disturbed that day evidently by the fact that they had dared to inspect and criticize his camp in his absence from this short interview with pfuel prince andrew thanks to his austerlitz experiences was able to form a clear conception of the man pfuel was one of those hopelessly and immutably self-confident men self-confident to the point of martyrdom as only germans are because only germans are self-confident on the basis of an abstract notion science that is the supposed knowledge of absolute truth a frenchman is self-assured because he regards himself personally both in mind and body as irresistibly attractive to men and women an englishman is self-assured as being a citizen of the best-organized state in the world and therefore as an englishman always knows what he should do and knows that all he does as an englishman is undoubtedly correct an italian is self-assured because he is excitable and easily forgets himself and other people a russian is self-assured just because he knows nothing and does not want to know anything since he does not believe that anything can be known the germans self-assurance is worst of all stronger and more repulsive than any other because he imagines that he knows the truth science which he himself has invented but which is for him the absolute truth pfuel was evidently of that sort he had a science the theory of oblique movements deduced by him from the history of frederick the greats wars and all he came across in the history of more recent warfare seemed to him absurd and barbarous monstrous collisions in which so many blunders were committed by both sides that these wars could not be called wars they did not accord with the theory and therefore could not serve as material for science in pfuel had been one of those responsible for the plan of campaign that ended in jena and auerstdt but he did not see the least proof of the fallibility of his theory in the disasters of that war on the contrary the deviations made from his theory were in his opinion the sole cause of the whole disaster and with characteristically gleeful sarcasm he would remark there i said the whole affair would go to the devil pfuel was one of those theoreticians who so love their theory that they lose sight of the theorys object its practical application his love of theory made him hate everything practical and he would not listen to it he was even pleased by failures for failures resulting from deviations in practice from the theory only proved to him the accuracy of his theory he said a few words to prince andrew and chernshev about the present war with the air of a man who knows beforehand that all will go wrong and who is not displeased that it should be so the unbrushed tufts of hair sticking up behind and the hastily brushed hair on his temples expressed this most eloquently he passed into the next room and the deep querulous sounds of his voice were at once heard from there chapter xi prince andrews eyes were
