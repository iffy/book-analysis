the person commanding and those who execute his command chapter vi only the expression of the will of the deity not dependent on time can relate to a whole series of events occurring over a period of years or centuries and only the deity independent of everything can by his sole will determine the direction of humanitys movement but man acts in time and himself takes part in what occurs reinstating the first condition omitted that of time we see that no command can be executed without some preceding order having been given rendering the execution of the last command possible no command ever appears spontaneously or itself covers a whole series of occurrences but each command follows from another and never refers to a whole series of events but always to one moment only of an event when for instance we say that napoleon ordered armies to go to war we combine in one simultaneous expression a whole series of consecutive commands dependent one on another napoleon could not have commanded an invasion of russia and never did so today he ordered such and such papers to be written to vienna to berlin and to petersburg tomorrow such and such decrees and orders to the army the fleet the commissariat and so on and so on millions of commands which formed a whole series corresponding to a series of events which brought the french armies into russia if throughout his reign napoleon gave commands concerning an invasion of england and expended on no other undertaking so much time and effort and yet during his whole reign never once attempted to execute that design but undertook an expedition into russia with which country he considered it desirable to be in alliance a conviction he repeatedly expressed this came about because his commands did not correspond to the course of events in the first case but did so correspond in the latter for an order to be certainly executed it is necessary that a man should order what can be executed but to know what can and what cannot be executed is impossible not only in the case of napoleons invasion of russia in which millions participated but even in the simplest event for in either case millions of obstacles may arise to prevent its execution every order executed is always one of an immense number unexecuted all the impossible orders inconsistent with the course of events remain unexecuted only the possible ones get linked up with a consecutive series of commands corresponding to a series of events and are executed our false conception that an event is caused by a command which precedes it is due to the fact that when the event has taken place and out of thousands of others those few commands which were consistent with that event have been executed we forget about the others that were not executed because they could not be apart from that the chief source of our error in this matter is due to the fact that in the historical accounts a whole series of innumerable diverse and petty events such for instance as all those which led the french armies to russia is generalized into one event in accord with the result produced by that series of events and corresponding with this generalization the whole series of commands is also generalized into a single expression of will we say that napoleon wished to invade russia and invaded it in reality in all napoleons activity we never find anything resembling an expression of that wish but find a series of orders or expressions of his will very variously and indefinitely directed amid a long series of unexecuted orders of napoleons one series for the campaign of was carried out not because those orders differed in any way from the other unexecuted orders but because they coincided with the course of events that led the french army into russia just as in stencil work this or that figure comes out not because the color was laid on from this side or in that way but because it was laid on from all sides over the figure cut in the stencil so that examining the relation in time of the commands to the events we find that a command can never be the cause of the event but that a certain definite dependence exists between the two to understand in what this dependence consists it is necessary to reinstate another omitted condition of every command proceeding not from the deity but from a man which
