is that the man who gives the command himself takes part in the event this relation of the commander to those he commands is just what is called power this relation consists in the following for common action people always unite in certain combinations in which regardless of the difference of the aims set for the common action the relation between those taking part in it is always the same men uniting in these combinations always assume such relations toward one another that the larger number take a more direct share and the smaller number a less direct share in the collective action for which they have combined of all the combinations in which men unite for collective action one of the most striking and definite examples is an army every army is composed of lower grades of the service the rank and file of whom there are always the greatest number of the next higher military rank corporals and noncommissioned officers of whom there are fewer and of still-higher officers of whom there are still fewer and so on to the highest military command which is concentrated in one person a military organization may be quite correctly compared to a cone of which the base with the largest diameter consists of the rank and file the next higher and smaller section of the cone consists of the next higher grades of the army and so on to the apex the point of which will represent the commander in chief the soldiers of whom there are the most form the lower section of the cone and its base the soldier himself does the stabbing hacking burning and pillaging and always receives orders for these actions from men above him he himself never gives an order the noncommissioned officers of whom there are fewer perform the action itself less frequently than the soldiers but they already give commands an officer still less often acts directly himself but commands still more frequently a general does nothing but command the troops indicates the objective and hardly ever uses a weapon himself the commander in chief never takes direct part in the action itself but only gives general orders concerning the movement of the mass of the troops a similar relation of people to one another is seen in every combination of men for common activity in agriculture trade and every administration and so without particularly analyzing all the contiguous sections of a cone and of the ranks of an army or the ranks and positions in any administrative or public business whatever from the lowest to the highest we see a law by which men to take associated action combine in such relations that the more directly they participate in performing the action the less they can command and the more numerous they are while the less their direct participation in the action itself the more they command and the fewer of them there are rising in this way from the lowest ranks to the man at the top who takes the least direct share in the action and directs his activity chiefly to commanding this relation of the men who command to those they command is what constitutes the essence of the conception called power having restored the condition of time under which all events occur we find that a command is executed only when it is related to a corresponding series of events restoring the essential condition of relation between those who command and those who execute we find that by the very nature of the case those who command take the smallest part in the action itself and that their activity is exclusively directed to commanding chapter vii when an event is taking place people express their opinions and wishes about it and as the event results from the collective activity of many people some one of the opinions or wishes expressed is sure to be fulfilled if but approximately when one of the opinions expressed is fulfilled that opinion gets connected with the event as a command preceding it men are hauling a log each of them expresses his opinion as to how and where to haul it they haul the log away and it happens that this is done as one of them said he ordered it there we have command and power in their primary form the man who worked most with his hands could not think so much about what he was doing or reflect on or command what would result from the common activity while the man
