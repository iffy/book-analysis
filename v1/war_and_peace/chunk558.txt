of the adjutant was heard natsha sat up snya are you asleep mamma she whispered no one replied natsha rose slowly and carefully crossed herself and stepped cautiously on the cold and dirty floor with her slim supple bare feet the boards of the floor creaked stepping cautiously from one foot to the other she ran like a kitten the few steps to the door and grasped the cold door handle it seemed to her that something heavy was beating rhythmically against all the walls of the room it was her own heart sinking with alarm and terror and overflowing with love she opened the door and stepped across the threshold and onto the cold damp earthen floor of the passage the cold she felt refreshed her with her bare feet she touched a sleeping man stepped over him and opened the door into the part of the hut where prince andrew lay it was dark in there in the farthest corner on a bench beside a bed on which something was lying stood a tallow candle with a long thick and smoldering wick from the moment she had been told that morning of prince andrews wound and his presence there natsha had resolved to see him she did not know why she had to she knew the meeting would be painful but felt the more convinced that it was necessary all day she had lived only in hope of seeing him that night but now that the moment had come she was filled with dread of what she might see how was he maimed what was left of him was he like that incessant moaning of the adjutants yes he was altogether like that in her imagination he was that terrible moaning personified when she saw an indistinct shape in the corner and mistook his knees raised under the quilt for his shoulders she imagined a horrible body there and stood still in terror but an irresistible impulse drew her forward she cautiously took one step and then another and found herself in the middle of a small room containing baggage another man timkhin was lying in a corner on the benches beneath the icons and two others the doctor and a valet lay on the floor the valet sat up and whispered something timkhin kept awake by the pain in his wounded leg gazed with wide-open eyes at this strange apparition of a girl in a white chemise dressing jacket and nightcap the valets sleepy frightened exclamation what do you want whats the matter made natsha approach more swiftly to what was lying in the corner horribly unlike a man as that body looked she must see him she passed the valet the snuff fell from the candle wick and she saw prince andrew clearly with his arms outside the quilt and such as she had always seen him he was the same as ever but the feverish color of his face his glittering eyes rapturously turned toward her and especially his neck delicate as a childs revealed by the turn-down collar of his shirt gave him a peculiarly innocent childlike look such as she had never seen on him before she went up to him and with a swift flexible youthful movement dropped on her knees he smiled and held out his hand to her chapter xxxii seven days had passed since prince andrew found himself in the ambulance station on the field of borodin his feverish state and the inflammation of his bowels which were injured were in the doctors opinion sure to carry him off but on the seventh day he ate with pleasure a piece of bread with some tea and the doctor noticed that his temperature was lower he had regained consciousness that morning the first night after they left moscow had been fairly warm and he had remained in the calche but at mytshchi the wounded man himself asked to be taken out and given some tea the pain caused by his removal into the hut had made him groan aloud and again lose consciousness when he had been placed on his camp bed he lay for a long time motionless with closed eyes then he opened them and whispered softly and the tea his remembering such a small detail of everyday life astonished the doctor he felt prince andrews pulse and to his surprise and dissatisfaction found it had improved he was dissatisfied because he knew by experience that if his patient did not die now he would do so a little later
