ready to agree with it but it is not what was asked all that would be interesting if we recognized a divine power based on itself and always consistently directing its nations through napoleons louis-es and writers but we do not acknowledge such a power and therefore before speaking about napoleons louis-es and authors we ought to be shown the connection existing between these men and the movement of the nations if instead of a divine power some other force has appeared it should be explained in what this new force consists for the whole interest of history lies precisely in that force history seems to assume that this force is self-evident and known to everyone but in spite of every desire to regard it as known anyone reading many historical works cannot help doubting whether this new force so variously understood by the historians themselves is really quite well known to everybody chapter ii what force moves the nations biographical historians and historians of separate nations understand this force as a power inherent in heroes and rulers in their narration events occur solely by the will of a napoleon and alexander or in general of the persons they describe the answers given by this kind of historian to the question of what force causes events to happen are satisfactory only as long as there is but one historian to each event as soon as historians of different nationalities and tendencies begin to describe the same event the replies they give immediately lose all meaning for this force is understood by them all not only differently but often in quite contradictory ways one historian says that an event was produced by napoleons power another that it was produced by alexanders a third that it was due to the power of some other person besides this historians of that kind contradict each other even in their statement as to the force on which the authority of some particular person was based thiers a bonapartist says that napoleons power was based on his virtue and genius lanfrey a republican says it was based on his trickery and deception of the people so the historians of this class by mutually destroying one anothers positions destroy the understanding of the force which produces events and furnish no reply to historys essential question writers of universal history who deal with all the nations seem to recognize how erroneous is the specialist historians view of the force which produces events they do not recognize it as a power inherent in heroes and rulers but as the resultant of a multiplicity of variously directed forces in describing a war or the subjugation of a people a general historian looks for the cause of the event not in the power of one man but in the interaction of many persons connected with the event according to this view the power of historical personages represented as the product of many forces can no longer it would seem be regarded as a force that itself produces events yet in most cases universal historians still employ the conception of power as a force that itself produces events and treat it as their cause in their exposition an historic character is first the product of his time and his power only the resultant of various forces and then his power is itself a force producing events gervinus schlosser and others for instance at one time prove napoleon to be a product of the revolution of the ideas of and so forth and at another plainly say that the campaign of and other things they do not like were simply the product of napoleons misdirected will and that the very ideas of were arrested in their development by napoleons caprice the ideas of the revolution and the general temper of the age produced napoleons power but napoleons power suppressed the ideas of the revolution and the general temper of the age this curious contradiction is not accidental not only does it occur at every step but the universal historians accounts are all made up of a chain of such contradictions this contradiction occurs because after entering the field of analysis the universal historians stop halfway to find component forces equal to the composite or resultant force the sum of the components must equal the resultant this condition is never observed by the universal historians and so to explain the resultant forces they are obliged to admit in addition to the insufficient components another unexplained force affecting the resultant action specialist historians describing the campaign of
