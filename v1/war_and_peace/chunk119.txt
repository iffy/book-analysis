brilliant position in society dont you think so i only wanted to know your opinion and anna pvlovna let pierre go pierre in reply sincerely agreed with her as to hlnes perfection of manner if he ever thought of hlne it was just of her beauty and her remarkable skill in appearing silently dignified in society the old aunt received the two young people in her corner but seemed desirous of hiding her adoration for hlne and inclined rather to show her fear of anna pvlovna she looked at her niece as if inquiring what she was to do with these people on leaving them anna pvlovna again touched pierres sleeve saying i hope you wont say that it is dull in my house again and she glanced at hlne hlne smiled with a look implying that she did not admit the possibility of anyone seeing her without being enchanted the aunt coughed swallowed and said in french that she was very pleased to see hlne then she turned to pierre with the same words of welcome and the same look in the middle of a dull and halting conversation hlne turned to pierre with the beautiful bright smile that she gave to everyone pierre was so used to that smile and it had so little meaning for him that he paid no attention to it the aunt was just speaking of a collection of snuffboxes that had belonged to pierres father count bezkhov and showed them her own box princess hlne asked to see the portrait of the aunts husband on the box lid that is probably the work of vinesse said pierre mentioning a celebrated miniaturist and he leaned over the table to take the snuffbox while trying to hear what was being said at the other table he half rose meaning to go round but the aunt handed him the snuffbox passing it across hlnes back hlne stooped forward to make room and looked round with a smile she was as always at evening parties wearing a dress such as was then fashionable cut very low at front and back her bust which had always seemed like marble to pierre was so close to him that his shortsighted eyes could not but perceive the living charm of her neck and shoulders so near to his lips that he need only have bent his head a little to have touched them he was conscious of the warmth of her body the scent of perfume and the creaking of her corset as she moved he did not see her marble beauty forming a complete whole with her dress but all the charm of her body only covered by her garments and having once seen this he could not help being aware of it just as we cannot renew an illusion we have once seen through so you have never noticed before how beautiful i am hlne seemed to say you had not noticed that i am a woman yes i am a woman who may belong to anyone to you too said her glance and at that moment pierre felt that hlne not only could but must be his wife and that it could not be otherwise he knew this at that moment as surely as if he had been standing at the altar with her how and when this would be he did not know he did not even know if it would be a good thing he even felt he knew not why that it would be a bad thing but he knew it would happen pierre dropped his eyes lifted them again and wished once more to see her as a distant beauty far removed from him as he had seen her every day until then but he could no longer do it he could not any more than a man who has been looking at a tuft of steppe grass through the mist and taking it for a tree can again take it for a tree after he has once recognized it to be a tuft of grass she was terribly close to him she already had power over him and between them there was no longer any barrier except the barrier of his own will well i will leave you in your little corner came anna pvlovnas voice i see you are all right there and pierre anxiously trying to remember whether he had done anything reprehensible looked round with a blush it seemed to him that everyone knew what had happened to him as he
