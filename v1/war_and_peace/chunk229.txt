bleed him and patch him up he will drag about as a cripple a burden to everybody for another ten years it would be far easier and simpler for him to die others are being born and there are plenty of them as it is it would be different if you grudged losing a laborer thats how i regard him but you want to cure him from love of him and he does not want that and besides what a notion that medicine ever cured anyone killed them yes said he frowning angrily and turning away from pierre prince andrew expressed his ideas so clearly and distinctly that it was evident he had reflected on this subject more than once and he spoke readily and rapidly like a man who has not talked for a long time his glance became more animated as his conclusions became more hopeless oh that is dreadful dreadful said pierre i dont understand how one can live with such ideas i had such moments myself not long ago in moscow and when traveling but at such times i collapsed so that i dont live at all everything seems hateful to me myself most of all then i dont eat dont wash and how is it with you why not wash that is not cleanly said prince andrew on the contrary one must try to make ones life as pleasant as possible im alive that is not my fault so i must live out my life as best i can without hurting others but with such ideas what motive have you for living one would sit without moving undertaking nothing life as it is leaves one no peace i should be thankful to do nothing but here on the one hand the local nobility have done me the honor to choose me to be their marshal it was all i could do to get out of it they could not understand that i have not the necessary qualifications for it the kind of good-natured fussy shallowness necessary for the position then theres this house which must be built in order to have a nook of ones own in which to be quiet and now theres this recruiting why arent you serving in the army after austerlitz said prince andrew gloomily no thank you very much i have promised myself not to serve again in the active russian army and i wont not even if bonaparte were here at smolnsk threatening bald hills even then i wouldnt serve in the russian army well as i was saying he continued recovering his composure now theres this recruiting my father is chief in command of the third district and my only way of avoiding active service is to serve under him then you are serving i am he paused a little while and why do you serve why for this reason my father is one of the most remarkable men of his time but he is growing old and though not exactly cruel he has too energetic a character he is so accustomed to unlimited power that he is terrible and now he has this authority of a commander in chief of the recruiting granted by the emperor if i had been two hours late a fortnight ago he would have had a paymasters clerk at ykhnovna hanged said prince andrew with a smile so i am serving because i alone have any influence with my father and now and then can save him from actions which would torment him afterwards well there you see yes but it is not as you imagine prince andrew continued i did not and do not in the least care about that scoundrel of a clerk who had stolen some boots from the recruits i should even have been very glad to see him hanged but i was sorry for my father that again is for myself prince andrew grew more and more animated his eyes glittered feverishly while he tried to prove to pierre that in his actions there was no desire to do good to his neighbor there now you wish to liberate your serfs he continued that is a very good thing but not for you i dont suppose you ever had anyone flogged or sent to siberia and still less for your serfs if they are beaten flogged or sent to siberia i dont suppose they are any the worse off in siberia they lead the same animal life and the stripes on their bodies heal and they are happy as
