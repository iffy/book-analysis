left her to his friend but the father whom the boy did not remember appeared to him a divinity who could not be pictured and of whom he never thought without a swelling heart and tears of sadness and rapture so the boy also was happy that pierre had arrived the guests welcomed pierre because he always helped to enliven and unite any company he was in the grown-up members of the family not to mention his wife were pleased to have back a friend whose presence made life run more smoothly and peacefully the old ladies were pleased with the presents he brought them and especially that natsha would now be herself again pierre felt the different outlooks of these various worlds and made haste to satisfy all their expectations though the most absent-minded and forgetful of men pierre with the aid of a list his wife drew up had now bought everything not forgetting his mother and brother-in-laws commissions nor the dress material for a present to belva nor toys for his wifes nephews in the early days of his marriage it had seemed strange to him that his wife should expect him not to forget to procure all the things he undertook to buy and he had been taken aback by her serious annoyance when on his first trip he forgot everything but in time he grew used to this demand knowing that natsha asked nothing for herself and gave him commissions for others only when he himself had offered to undertake them he now found an unexpected and childlike pleasure in this purchase of presents for everyone in the house and never forgot anything if he now incurred natshas censure it was only for buying too many and too expensive things to her other defects as most people thought them but which to pierre were qualities of untidiness and neglect of herself she now added stinginess from the time that pierre began life as a family man on a footing entailing heavy expenditure he had noticed to his surprise that he spent only half as much as before and that his affairs which had been in disorder of late chiefly because of his first wifes debts had begun to improve life was cheaper because it was circumscribed that most expensive luxury the kind of life that can be changed at any moment was no longer his nor did he wish for it he felt that his way of life had now been settled once for all till death and that to change it was not in his power and so that way of life proved economical with a merry smiling face pierre was sorting his purchases what do you think of this said he unrolling a piece of stuff like a shopman natsha who was sitting opposite to him with her eldest daughter on her lap turned her sparkling eyes swiftly from her husband to the things he showed her thats for belva excellent she felt the quality of the material it was a ruble an arshin i suppose pierre told her the price too dear natsha remarked how pleased the children will be and mamma too only you need not have bought me this she added unable to suppress a smile as she gazed admiringly at a gold comb set with pearls of a kind then just coming into fashion adle tempted me she kept on telling me to buy it returned pierre when am i to wear it and natsha stuck it in her coil of hair when i take little msha into society perhaps they will be fashionable again by then well lets go now and collecting the presents they went first to the nursery and then to the old countess rooms the countess was sitting with her companion belva playing grand-patience as usual when pierre and natsha came into the drawing room with parcels under their arms the countess was now over sixty was quite gray and wore a cap with a frill that surrounded her face her face had shriveled her upper lip had sunk in and her eyes were dim after the deaths of her son and husband in such rapid succession she felt herself a being accidentally forgotten in this world and left without aim or object for her existence she ate drank slept or kept awake but did not live life gave her no new impressions she wanted nothing from life but tranquillity and that tranquillity only death could give her but until death came she had to go on
