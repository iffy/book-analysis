suffering and weary voice he was saying something to tkhon speaking of the crimea and its warm nights and of the empress evidently he had wanted to talk and why didnt he call me why didnt he let me be there instead of tkhon princess mary had thought and thought again now now he will never tell anyone what he had in his soul never will that moment return for him or for me when he might have said all he longed to say and not tkhon but i might have heard and understood him why didnt i enter the room she thought perhaps he would then have said to me what he said the day he died while talking to tkhon he asked about me twice he wanted to see me and i was standing close by outside the door it was sad and painful for him to talk to tkhon who did not understand him i remember how he began speaking to him about lise as if she were alive he had forgotten she was dead and tkhon reminded him that she was no more and he shouted fool he was greatly depressed from behind the door i heard how he lay down on his bed groaning and loudly exclaimed my god why didnt i go in then what could he have done to me what could i have lost and perhaps he would then have been comforted and would have said that word to me and princess mary uttered aloud the caressing word he had said to her on the day of his death dear-est she repeated and began sobbing with tears that relieved her soul she now saw his face before her and not the face she had known ever since she could remember and had always seen at a distance but the timid feeble face she had seen for the first time quite closely with all its wrinkles and details when she stooped near to his mouth to catch what he said dear-est she repeated again what was he thinking when he uttered that word what is he thinking now this question suddenly presented itself to her and in answer she saw him before her with the expression that was on his face as he lay in his coffin with his chin bound up with a white handkerchief and the horror that had seized her when she touched him and convinced herself that that was not he but something mysterious and horrible seized her again she tried to think of something else and to pray but could do neither with wide-open eyes she gazed at the moonlight and the shadows expecting every moment to see his dead face and she felt that the silence brooding over the house and within it held her fast dunysha she whispered dunysha she screamed wildly and tearing herself out of this silence she ran to the servants quarters to meet her old nurse and the maidservants who came running toward her chapter xiii on the seventeenth of august rostv and ilyn accompanied by lavrshka who had just returned from captivity and by an hussar orderly left their quarters at yankvo ten miles from boguchrovo and went for a ride to try a new horse ilyn had bought and to find out whether there was any hay to be had in the villages for the last three days boguchrovo had lain between the two hostile armies so that it was as easy for the russian rearguard to get to it as for the french vanguard rostv as a careful squadron commander wished to take such provisions as remained at boguchrovo before the french could get them rostv and ilyn were in the merriest of moods on the way to boguchrovo a princely estate with a dwelling house and farm where they hoped to find many domestic serfs and pretty girls they questioned lavrshka about napoleon and laughed at his stories and raced one another to try ilyns horse rostv had no idea that the village he was entering was the property of that very bolknski who had been engaged to his sister rostv and ilyn gave rein to their horses for a last race along the incline before reaching boguchrovo and rostv outstripping ilyn was the first to gallop into the village street youre first cried ilyn flushed yes always first both on the grassland and here answered rostv stroking his heated donts horse and id have won on my frenchy your excellency said lavrshka from behind alluding to his shabby cart
