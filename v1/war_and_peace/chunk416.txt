action would then be taken but the command of the armies became still more confused and enfeebled bennigsen the tsarvich and a swarm of adjutants general remained with the army to keep the commander in chief under observation and arouse his energy and barclay feeling less free than ever under the observation of all these eyes of the emperor became still more cautious of undertaking any decisive action and avoided giving battle barclay stood for caution the tsarvich hinted at treachery and demanded a general engagement lubomrski bronntski wlocki and the others of that group stirred up so much trouble that barclay under pretext of sending papers to the emperor dispatched these polish adjutants general to petersburg and plunged into an open struggle with bennigsen and the tsarvich at smolnsk the armies at last reunited much as bagratin disliked it bagratin drove up in a carriage to the house occupied by barclay barclay donned his sash and came out to meet and report to his senior officer bagratin despite his seniority in rank bagratin in this contest of magnanimity took his orders from barclay but having submitted agreed with him less than ever by the emperors orders bagratin reported direct to him he wrote to arakchev the emperors confidant it must be as my sovereign pleases but i cannot work with the minister meaning barclay for gods sake send me somewhere else if only in command of a regiment i cannot stand it here headquarters are so full of germans that a russian cannot exist and there is no sense in anything i thought i was really serving my sovereign and the fatherland but it turns out that i am serving barclay i confess i do not want to the swarm of bronntskis and wintzingerodes and their like still further embittered the relations between the commanders in chief and even less unity resulted preparations were made to fight the french before smolnsk a general was sent to survey the position this general hating barclay rode to visit a friend of his own a corps commander and having spent the day with him returned to barclay and condemned as unsuitable from every point of view the battleground he had not seen while disputes and intrigues were going on about the future field of battle and while we were looking for the french having lost touch with them the french stumbled upon nevrovskis division and reached the walls of smolnsk it was necessary to fight an unexpected battle at smolnsk to save our lines of communication the battle was fought and thousands were killed on both sides smolnsk was abandoned contrary to the wishes of the emperor and of the whole people but smolnsk was burned by its own inhabitants who had been misled by their governor and these ruined inhabitants setting an example to other russians went to moscow thinking only of their own losses but kindling hatred of the foe napoleon advanced farther and we retired thus arriving at the very result which caused his destruction chapter ii the day after his son had left prince nicholas sent for princess mary to come to his study well are you satisfied now said he youve made me quarrel with my son satisfied are you thats all you wanted satisfied it hurts me it hurts im old and weak and this is what you wanted well then gloat over it gloat over it after that princess mary did not see her father for a whole week he was ill and did not leave his study princess mary noticed to her surprise that during this illness the old prince not only excluded her from his room but did not admit mademoiselle bourienne either tkhon alone attended him at the end of the week the prince reappeared and resumed his former way of life devoting himself with special activity to building operations and the arrangement of the gardens and completely breaking off his relations with mademoiselle bourienne his looks and cold tone to his daughter seemed to say there you see you plotted against me you lied to prince andrew about my relations with that frenchwoman and made me quarrel with him but you see i need neither her nor you princess mary spent half of every day with little nicholas watching his lessons teaching him russian and music herself and talking to dessalles the rest of the day she spent over her books with her old nurse or with gods folk who sometimes came by the back door to see her of the war princess
