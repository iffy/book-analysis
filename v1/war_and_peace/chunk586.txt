and in french then two pairs of frenchmen approached the criminals and at the officers command took the two convicts who stood first in the row the convicts stopped when they reached the post and while sacks were being brought looked dumbly around as a wounded beast looks at an approaching huntsman one crossed himself continually the other scratched his back and made a movement of the lips resembling a smile with hurried hands the soldiers blindfolded them drawing the sacks over their heads and bound them to the post twelve sharpshooters with muskets stepped out of the ranks with a firm regular tread and halted eight paces from the post pierre turned away to avoid seeing what was going to happen suddenly a crackling rolling noise was heard which seemed to him louder than the most terrific thunder and he looked round there was some smoke and the frenchmen were doing something near the pit with pale faces and trembling hands two more prisoners were led up in the same way and with similar looks these two glanced vainly at the onlookers with only a silent appeal for protection in their eyes evidently unable to understand or believe what was going to happen to them they could not believe it because they alone knew what their life meant to them and so they neither understood nor believed that it could be taken from them again pierre did not wish to look and again turned away but again the sound as of a frightful explosion struck his ear and at the same moment he saw smoke blood and the pale scared faces of the frenchmen who were again doing something by the post their trembling hands impeding one another pierre breathing heavily looked around as if asking what it meant the same question was expressed in all the looks that met his on the faces of all the russians and of the french soldiers and officers without exception he read the same dismay horror and conflict that were in his own heart but who after all is doing this they are all suffering as i am who then is it who flashed for an instant through his mind sharpshooters of the th forward shouted someone the fifth prisoner the one next to pierre was led away alone pierre did not understand that he was saved that he and the rest had been brought there only to witness the execution with ever-growing horror and no sense of joy or relief he gazed at what was taking place the fifth man was the factory lad in the loose cloak the moment they laid hands on him he sprang aside in terror and clutched at pierre pierre shuddered and shook himself free the lad was unable to walk they dragged him along holding him up under the arms and he screamed when they got him to the post he grew quiet as if he suddenly understood something whether he understood that screaming was useless or whether he thought it incredible that men should kill him at any rate he took his stand at the post waiting to be blindfolded like the others and like a wounded animal looked around him with glittering eyes pierre was no longer able to turn away and close his eyes his curiosity and agitation like that of the whole crowd reached the highest pitch at this fifth murder like the others this fifth man seemed calm he wrapped his loose cloak closer and rubbed one bare foot with the other when they began to blindfold him he himself adjusted the knot which hurt the back of his head then when they propped him against the bloodstained post he leaned back and not being comfortable in that position straightened himself adjusted his feet and leaned back again more comfortably pierre did not take his eyes from him and did not miss his slightest movement probably a word of command was given and was followed by the reports of eight muskets but try as he would pierre could not afterwards remember having heard the slightest sound of the shots he only saw how the workman suddenly sank down on the cords that held him how blood showed itself in two places how the ropes slackened under the weight of the hanging body and how the workman sat down his head hanging unnaturally and one leg bent under him pierre ran up to the post no one hindered him pale frightened people were doing something around the workman the lower jaw of an
