friday when he awoke on the thursday savlich came to ask him about packing for the journey what to petersburg what is petersburg who is there in petersburg he asked involuntarily though only to himself oh yes long ago before this happened i did for some reason mean to go to petersburg he reflected why but perhaps i shall go what a good fellow he is and how attentive and how he remembers everything he thought looking at savlichs old face and what a pleasant smile he has well savlich do you still not wish to accept your freedom pierre asked him whats the good of freedom to me your excellency we lived under the late count the kingdom of heaven be his and we have lived under you too without ever being wronged and your children the children will live just the same with such masters one can live but what about my heirs said pierre supposing i suddenly marry it might happen he added with an involuntary smile if i may take the liberty your excellency it would be a good thing how easy he thinks it thought pierre he doesnt know how terrible it is and how dangerous too soon or too late it is terrible so what are your orders are you starting tomorrow asked savlich no ill put it off for a bit ill tell you later you must forgive the trouble i have put you to said pierre and seeing savlich smile he thought but how strange it is that he should not know that now there is no petersburg for me and that that must be settled first of all but probably he knows it well enough and is only pretending shall i have a talk with him and see what he thinks pierre reflected no another time at breakfast pierre told the princess his cousin that he had been to see princess mary the day before and had there met whom do you think natsha rostva the princess seemed to see nothing more extraordinary in that than if he had seen anna semnovna do you know her asked pierre i have seen the princess she replied i heard that they were arranging a match for her with young rostv it would be a very good thing for the rostvs they are said to be utterly ruined no i mean do you know natsha rostva i heard about that affair of hers at the time it was a great pity no she either doesnt understand or is pretending thought pierre better not say anything to her either the princess too had prepared provisions for pierres journey how kind they all are thought pierre what is surprising is that they should trouble about these things now when it can no longer be of interest to them and all for me on the same day the chief of police came to pierre inviting him to send a representative to the faceted palace to recover things that were to be returned to their owners that day and this man too thought pierre looking into the face of the chief of police what a fine good-looking officer and how kind fancy bothering about such trifles now and they actually say he is not honest and takes bribes what nonsense besides why shouldnt he take bribes thats the way he was brought up and everybody does it but what a kind pleasant face and how he smiles as he looks at me pierre went to princess marys to dinner as he drove through the streets past the houses that had been burned down he was surprised by the beauty of those ruins the picturesqueness of the chimney stacks and tumble-down walls of the burned-out quarters of the town stretching out and concealing one another reminded him of the rhine and the colosseum the cabmen he met and their passengers the carpenters cutting the timber for new houses with axes the women hawkers and the shopkeepers all looked at him with cheerful beaming eyes that seemed to say ah there he is lets see what will come of it at the entrance to princess marys house pierre felt doubtful whether he had really been there the night before and really seen natsha and talked to her perhaps i imagined it perhaps i shall go in and find no one there but he had hardly entered the room before he felt her presence with his whole being by the loss of his sense of freedom she was in the same black dress
