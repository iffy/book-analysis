redoubt was an advanced post whereas in reality it was simply a fortified point on the left flank and that the battle of borodin was fought by us on an entrenched position previously selected whereas it was fought on a quite unexpected spot which was almost unentrenched the case was evidently this a position was selected along the river koloch which crosses the highroad not at a right angle but at an acute angle so that the left flank was at shevrdino the right flank near the village of nvoe and the center at borodin at the confluence of the rivers koloch and vyna to anyone who looks at the field of borodin without thinking of how the battle was actually fought this position protected by the river koloch presents itself as obvious for an army whose object was to prevent an enemy from advancing along the smolnsk road to moscow napoleon riding to valevo on the twenty-fourth did not see as the history books say he did the position of the russians from uttsa to borodin he could not have seen that position because it did not exist nor did he see an advanced post of the russian army but while pursuing the russian rearguard he came upon the left flank of the russian position at the shevrdino redoubt and unexpectedly for the russians moved his army across the koloch and the russians not having time to begin a general engagement withdrew their left wing from the position they had intended to occupy and took up a new position which had not been foreseen and was not fortified by crossing to the other side of the koloch to the left of the highroad napoleon shifted the whole forthcoming battle from right to left looking from the russian side and transferred it to the plain between uttsa semnovsk and borodin a plain no more advantageous as a position than any other plain in russia and there the whole battle of the twenty-sixth of august took place had napoleon not ridden out on the evening of the twenty-fourth to the koloch and had he not then ordered an immediate attack on the redoubt but had begun the attack next morning no one would have doubted that the shevrdino redoubt was the left flank of our position and the battle would have taken place where we expected it in that case we should probably have defended the shevrdino redoubt our left flank still more obstinately we should have attacked napoleon in the center or on the right and the engagement would have taken place on the twenty-fifth in the position we intended and had fortified but as the attack on our left flank took place in the evening after the retreat of our rear guard that is immediately after the fight at gridnva and as the russian commanders did not wish or were not in time to begin a general engagement then on the evening of the twenty-fourth the first and chief action of the battle of borodin was already lost on the twenty-fourth and obviously led to the loss of the one fought on the twenty-sixth after the loss of the shevrdino redoubt we found ourselves on the morning of the twenty-fifth without a position for our left flank and were forced to bend it back and hastily entrench it where it chanced to be not only was the russian army on the twenty-sixth defended by weak unfinished entrenchments but the disadvantage of that position was increased by the fact that the russian commanders not having fully realized what had happened namely the loss of our position on the left flank and the shifting of the whole field of the forthcoming battle from right to left maintained their extended position from the village of nvoe to uttsa and consequently had to move their forces from right to left during the battle so it happened that throughout the whole battle the russians opposed the entire french army launched against our left flank with but half as many men poniatowskis action against uttsa and uvrovs on the right flank against the french were actions distinct from the main course of the battle so the battle of borodin did not take place at all as in an effort to conceal our commanders mistakes even at the cost of diminishing the glory due to the russian army and people it has been described the battle of borodin was not fought on a chosen and entrenched position with forces only slightly weaker than those of the enemy but
