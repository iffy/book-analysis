to him and his handsome head held high entered his fathers room with the good-humored and victorious air natural to him prince vaslis two valets were busy dressing him and he looked round with much animation and cheerfully nodded to his son as the latter entered as if to say yes thats how i want you to look i say father joking apart is she very hideous anatole asked as if continuing a conversation the subject of which had often been mentioned during the journey enough what nonsense above all try to be respectful and cautious with the old prince if he starts a row ill go away said prince anatole i cant bear those old men eh remember for you everything depends on this in the meantime not only was it known in the maidservants rooms that the minister and his son had arrived but the appearance of both had been minutely described princess mary was sitting alone in her room vainly trying to master her agitation why did they write why did lise tell me about it it can never happen she said looking at herself in the glass how shall i enter the drawing room even if i like him i cant now be myself with him the mere thought of her fathers look filled her with terror the little princess and mademoiselle bourienne had already received from msha the ladys maid the necessary report of how handsome the ministers son was with his rosy cheeks and dark eyebrows and with what difficulty the father had dragged his legs upstairs while the son had followed him like an eagle three steps at a time having received this information the little princess and mademoiselle bourienne whose chattering voices had reached her from the corridor went into princess marys room you know theyve come marie said the little princess waddling in and sinking heavily into an armchair she was no longer in the loose gown she generally wore in the morning but had on one of her best dresses her hair was carefully done and her face was animated which however did not conceal its sunken and faded outlines dressed as she used to be in petersburg society it was still more noticeable how much plainer she had become some unobtrusive touch had been added to mademoiselle bouriennes toilet which rendered her fresh and pretty face yet more attractive what are you going to remain as you are dear princess she began theyll be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawing room and we shall have to go down and you have not smartened yourself up at all the little princess got up rang for the maid and hurriedly and merrily began to devise and carry out a plan of how princess mary should be dressed princess marys self-esteem was wounded by the fact that the arrival of a suitor agitated her and still more so by both her companions not having the least conception that it could be otherwise to tell them that she felt ashamed for herself and for them would be to betray her agitation while to decline their offers to dress her would prolong their banter and insistence she flushed her beautiful eyes grew dim red blotches came on her face and it took on the unattractive martyrlike expression it so often wore as she submitted herself to mademoiselle bourienne and lise both these women quite sincerely tried to make her look pretty she was so plain that neither of them could think of her as a rival so they began dressing her with perfect sincerity and with the nave and firm conviction women have that dress can make a face pretty no really my dear this dress is not pretty said lise looking sideways at princess mary from a little distance you have a maroon dress have it fetched really you know the fate of your whole life may be at stake but this one is too light its not becoming it was not the dress but the face and whole figure of princess mary that was not pretty but neither mademoiselle bourienne nor the little princess felt this they still thought that if a blue ribbon were placed in the hair the hair combed up and the blue scarf arranged lower on the best maroon dress and so on all would be well they forgot that the frightened face and the figure could not be altered and that however they might change the setting and adornment of that face it would still remain piteous
