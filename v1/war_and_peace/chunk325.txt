we have built in moscow forty times forty churches but yesterday a deserter was knouted to death and a minister of that same law of love and forgiveness a priest gave the soldier a cross to kiss before his execution so thought pierre and the whole of this general deception which everyone accepts accustomed as he was to it astonished him each time as if it were something new i understand the deception and confusion he thought but how am i to tell them all that i see i have tried and have always found that they too in the depths of their souls understand it as i do and only try not to see it so it appears that it must be so but i what is to become of me thought he he had the unfortunate capacity many men especially russians have of seeing and believing in the possibility of goodness and truth but of seeing the evil and falsehood of life too clearly to be able to take a serious part in it every sphere of work was connected in his eyes with evil and deception whatever he tried to be whatever he engaged in the evil and falsehood of it repulsed him and blocked every path of activity yet he had to live and to find occupation it was too dreadful to be under the burden of these insoluble problems so he abandoned himself to any distraction in order to forget them he frequented every kind of society drank much bought pictures engaged in building and above all read he read and read everything that came to hand on coming home while his valets were still taking off his things he picked up a book and began to read from reading he passed to sleeping from sleeping to gossip in drawing rooms of the club from gossip to carousals and women from carousals back to gossip reading and wine drinking became more and more a physical and also a moral necessity though the doctors warned him that with his corpulence wine was dangerous for him he drank a great deal he was only quite at ease when having poured several glasses of wine mechanically into his large mouth he felt a pleasant warmth in his body an amiability toward all his fellows and a readiness to respond superficially to every idea without probing it deeply only after emptying a bottle or two did he feel dimly that the terribly tangled skein of life which previously had terrified him was not as dreadful as he had thought he was always conscious of some aspect of that skein as with a buzzing in his head after dinner or supper he chatted or listened to conversation or read but under the influence of wine he said to himself it doesnt matter ill get it unraveled i have a solution ready but have no time now ill think it all out later on but the later on never came in the morning on an empty stomach all the old questions appeared as insoluble and terrible as ever and pierre hastily picked up a book and if anyone came to see him he was glad sometimes he remembered how he had heard that soldiers in war when entrenched under the enemys fire if they have nothing to do try hard to find some occupation the more easily to bear the danger to pierre all men seemed like those soldiers seeking refuge from life some in ambition some in cards some in framing laws some in women some in toys some in horses some in politics some in sport some in wine and some in governmental affairs nothing is trivial and nothing is important its all the same only to save oneself from it as best one can thought pierre only not to see it that dreadful it chapter ii at the beginning of winter prince nicholas bolknski and his daughter moved to moscow at that time enthusiasm for the emperor alexanders regime had weakened and a patriotic and anti-french tendency prevailed there and this together with his past and his intellect and his originality at once made prince nicholas bolknski an object of particular respect to the moscovites and the center of the moscow opposition to the government the prince had aged very much that year he showed marked signs of senility by a tendency to fall asleep forgetfulness of quite recent events remembrance of remote ones and the childish vanity with which he accepted the role of head of the moscow opposition
