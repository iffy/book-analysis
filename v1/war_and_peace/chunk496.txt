now it is too late i know it chapter xxxviii the terrible spectacle of the battlefield covered with dead and wounded together with the heaviness of his head and the news that some twenty generals he knew personally had been killed or wounded and the consciousness of the impotence of his once mighty arm produced an unexpected impression on napoleon who usually liked to look at the killed and wounded thereby he considered testing his strength of mind this day the horrible appearance of the battlefield overcame that strength of mind which he thought constituted his merit and his greatness he rode hurriedly from the battlefield and returned to the shevrdino knoll where he sat on his campstool his sallow face swollen and heavy his eyes dim his nose red and his voice hoarse involuntarily listening with downcast eyes to the sounds of firing with painful dejection he awaited the end of this action in which he regarded himself as a participant and which he was unable to arrest a personal human feeling for a brief moment got the better of the artificial phantasm of life he had served so long he felt in his own person the sufferings and death he had witnessed on the battlefield the heaviness of his head and chest reminded him of the possibility of suffering and death for himself at that moment he did not desire moscow or victory or glory what need had he for any more glory the one thing he wished for was rest tranquillity and freedom but when he had been on the semnovsk heights the artillery commander had proposed to him to bring several batteries of artillery up to those heights to strengthen the fire on the russian troops crowded in front of knyazkvo napoleon had assented and had given orders that news should be brought to him of the effect those batteries produced an adjutant came now to inform him that the fire of two hundred guns had been concentrated on the russians as he had ordered but that they still held their ground our fire is mowing them down by rows but still they hold on said the adjutant they want more said napoleon in a hoarse voice sire asked the adjutant who had not heard the remark they want more croaked napoleon frowning let them have it even before he gave that order the thing he did not desire and for which he gave the order only because he thought it was expected of him was being done and he fell back into that artificial realm of imaginary greatness and again as a horse walking a treadmill thinks it is doing something for itself he submissively fulfilled the cruel sad gloomy and inhuman role predestined for him and not for that day and hour alone were the mind and conscience darkened of this man on whom the responsibility for what was happening lay more than on all the others who took part in it never to the end of his life could he understand goodness beauty or truth or the significance of his actions which were too contrary to goodness and truth too remote from everything human for him ever to be able to grasp their meaning he could not disavow his actions belauded as they were by half the world and so he had to repudiate truth goodness and all humanity not only on that day as he rode over the battlefield strewn with men killed and maimed by his will as he believed did he reckon as he looked at them how many russians there were for each frenchman and deceiving himself find reason for rejoicing in the calculation that there were five russians for every frenchman not on that day alone did he write in a letter to paris that the battle field was superb because fifty thousand corpses lay there but even on the island of st helena in the peaceful solitude where he said he intended to devote his leisure to an account of the great deeds he had done he wrote the russian war should have been the most popular war of modern times it was a war of good sense for real interests for the tranquillity and security of all it was purely pacific and conservative it was a war for a great cause the end of uncertainties and the beginning of security a new horizon and new labors were opening out full of well-being and prosperity for all the european system was already founded all that remained was to organize
