been destroyed pierre unconsciously felt that a quite different firm french order had been established over this ruined nest he felt this in the looks of the soldiers who marching in regular ranks briskly and gaily were escorting him and the other criminals he felt it in the looks of an important french official in a carriage and pair driven by a soldier whom they met on the way he felt it in the merry sounds of regimental music he heard from the left side of the field and felt and realized it especially from the list of prisoners the french officer had read out when he came that morning pierre had been taken by one set of soldiers and led first to one and then to another place with dozens of other men and it seemed that they might have forgotten him or confused him with the others but no the answers he had given when questioned had come back to him in his designation as the man who does not give his name and under that appellation which to pierre seemed terrible they were now leading him somewhere with unhesitating assurance on their faces that he and all the other prisoners were exactly the ones they wanted and that they were being taken to the proper place pierre felt himself to be an insignificant chip fallen among the wheels of a machine whose action he did not understand but which was working well he and the other prisoners were taken to the right side of the virgins field to a large white house with an immense garden not far from the convent this was prince shcherbtovs house where pierre had often been in other days and which as he learned from the talk of the soldiers was now occupied by the marshal the duke of eckmhl davout they were taken to the entrance and led into the house one by one pierre was the sixth to enter he was conducted through a glass gallery an anteroom and a hall which were familiar to him into a long low study at the door of which stood an adjutant davout spectacles on nose sat bent over a table at the further end of the room pierre went close up to him but davout evidently consulting a paper that lay before him did not look up without raising his eyes he said in a low voice who are you pierre was silent because he was incapable of uttering a word to him davout was not merely a french general but a man notorious for his cruelty looking at his cold face as he sat like a stern schoolmaster who was prepared to wait awhile for an answer pierre felt that every instant of delay might cost him his life but he did not know what to say he did not venture to repeat what he had said at his first examination yet to disclose his rank and position was dangerous and embarrassing so he was silent but before he had decided what to do davout raised his head pushed his spectacles back on his forehead screwed up his eyes and looked intently at him i know that man he said in a cold measured tone evidently calculated to frighten pierre the chill that had been running down pierres back now seized his head as in a vise you cannot know me general i have never seen you he is a russian spy davout interrupted addressing another general who was present but whom pierre had not noticed davout turned away with an unexpected reverberation in his voice pierre rapidly began no monseigneur he said suddenly remembering that davout was a duke no monseigneur you cannot have known me i am a militia officer and have not quitted moscow your name asked davout bezkhov what proof have i that you are not lying monseigneur exclaimed pierre not in an offended but in a pleading voice davout looked up and gazed intently at him for some seconds they looked at one another and that look saved pierre apart from conditions of war and law that look established human relations between the two men at that moment an immense number of things passed dimly through both their minds and they realized that they were both children of humanity and were brothers at the first glance when davout had only raised his head from the papers where human affairs and lives were indicated by numbers pierre was merely a circumstance and davout could have shot him without burdening
