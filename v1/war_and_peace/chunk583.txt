of condescension or a kind of civility that this device of placing a channel was employed he knew he was in these mens power that only by force had they brought him there that force alone gave them the right to demand answers to their questions and that the sole object of that assembly was to inculpate him and so as they had the power and wish to inculpate him this expedient of an inquiry and trial seemed unnecessary it was evident that any answer would lead to conviction when asked what he was doing when he was arrested pierre replied in a rather tragic manner that he was restoring to its parents a child he had saved from the flames why had he fought the marauder pierre answered that he was protecting a woman and that to protect a woman who was being insulted was the duty of every man that they interrupted him for this was not to the point why was he in the yard of a burning house where witnesses had seen him he replied that he had gone out to see what was happening in moscow again they interrupted him they had not asked where he was going but why he was found near the fire who was he they asked repeating their first question which he had declined to answer again he replied that he could not answer it put that down thats bad very bad sternly remarked the general with the white mustache and red flushed face on the fourth day fires broke out on the zbovski rampart pierre and thirteen others were moved to the coach house of a merchants house near the crimean bridge on his way through the streets pierre felt stifled by the smoke which seemed to hang over the whole city fires were visible on all sides he did not then realize the significance of the burning of moscow and looked at the fires with horror he passed four days in the coach house near the crimean bridge and during that time learned from the talk of the french soldiers that all those confined there were awaiting a decision which might come any day from the marshal what marshal this was pierre could not learn from the soldiers evidently for them the marshal represented a very high and rather mysterious power these first days before the eighth of september when the prisoners were had up for a second examination were the hardest of all for pierre chapter x on the eighth of september an officer a very important one judging by the respect the guards showed him entered the coach house where the prisoners were this officer probably someone on the staff was holding a paper in his hand and called over all the russians there naming pierre as the man who does not give his name glancing indolently and indifferently at all the prisoners he ordered the officer in charge to have them decently dressed and tidied up before taking them to the marshal an hour later a squad of soldiers arrived and pierre with thirteen others was led to the virgins field it was a fine day sunny after rain and the air was unusually pure the smoke did not hang low as on the day when pierre had been taken from the guardhouse on the zbovski rampart but rose through the pure air in columns no flames were seen but columns of smoke rose on all sides and all moscow as far as pierre could see was one vast charred ruin on all sides there were waste spaces with only stoves and chimney stacks still standing and here and there the blackened walls of some brick houses pierre gazed at the ruins and did not recognize districts he had known well here and there he could see churches that had not been burned the krmlin which was not destroyed gleamed white in the distance with its towers and the belfry of ivn the great the domes of the new convent of the virgin glittered brightly and its bells were ringing particularly clearly these bells reminded pierre that it was sunday and the feast of the nativity of the virgin but there seemed to be no one to celebrate this holiday everywhere were blackened ruins and the few russians to be seen were tattered and frightened people who tried to hide when they saw the french it was plain that the russian nest was ruined and destroyed but in place of the russian order of life that had
