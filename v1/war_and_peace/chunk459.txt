that he expected to end the campaign by occupying moscow as he had ended a previous campaign by occupying vienna there is much evidence to the contrary napoleons historians themselves tell us that from smolnsk onwards he wished to stop knew the danger of his extended position and knew that the occupation of moscow would not be the end of the campaign for he had seen at smolnsk the state in which russian towns were left to him and had not received a single reply to his repeated announcements of his wish to negotiate in giving and accepting battle at borodin kutzov acted involuntarily and irrationally but later on to fit what had occurred the historians provided cunningly devised evidence of the foresight and genius of the generals who of all the blind tools of history were the most enslaved and involuntary the ancients have left us model heroic poems in which the heroes furnish the whole interest of the story and we are still unable to accustom ourselves to the fact that for our epoch histories of that kind are meaningless on the other question how the battle of borodin and the preceding battle of shevrdino were fought there also exists a definite and well-known but quite false conception all the historians describe the affair as follows the russian army they say in its retreat from smolnsk sought out for itself the best position for a general engagement and found such a position at borodin the russians they say fortified this position in advance on the left of the highroad from moscow to smolnsk and almost at a right angle to it from borodin to uttsa at the very place where the battle was fought in front of this position they say a fortified outpost was set up on the shevrdino mound to observe the enemy on the twenty-fourth we are told napoleon attacked this advanced post and took it and on the twenty-sixth attacked the whole russian army which was in position on the field of borodin so the histories say and it is all quite wrong as anyone who cares to look into the matter can easily convince himself the russians did not seek out the best position but on the contrary during the retreat passed many positions better than borodin they did not stop at any one of these positions because kutzov did not wish to occupy a position he had not himself chosen because the popular demand for a battle had not yet expressed itself strongly enough and because milordovich had not yet arrived with the militia and for many other reasons the fact is that other positions they had passed were stronger and that the position at borodin the one where the battle was fought far from being strong was no more a position than any other spot one might find in the russian empire by sticking a pin into the map at hazard not only did the russians not fortify the position on the field of borodin to the left of and at a right angle to the highroad that is the position on which the battle took place but never till the twenty-fifth of august did they think that a battle might be fought there this was shown first by the fact that there were no entrenchments there by the twenty fifth and that those begun on the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth were not completed and secondly by the position of the shevrdino redoubt that redoubt was quite senseless in front of the position where the battle was accepted why was it more strongly fortified than any other post and why were all efforts exhausted and six thousand men sacrificed to defend it till late at night on the twenty-fourth a cossack patrol would have sufficed to observe the enemy thirdly as proof that the position on which the battle was fought had not been foreseen and that the shevrdino redoubt was not an advanced post of that position we have the fact that up to the twenty-fifth barclay de tolly and bagratin were convinced that the shevrdino redoubt was the left flank of the position and that kutzov himself in his report written in hot haste after the battle speaks of the shevrdino redoubt as the left flank of the position it was much later when reports on the battle of borodin were written at leisure that the incorrect and extraordinary statement was invented probably to justify the mistakes of a commander in chief who had to be represented as infallible that the shevrdino
