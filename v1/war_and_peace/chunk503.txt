disappointment as though they were not speaking of anything he wished to hear some discussed the position that had been chosen criticizing not the position itself so much as the mental capacity of those who had chosen it others argued that a mistake had been made earlier and that a battle should have been fought two days before others again spoke of the battle of salamanca which was described by crosart a newly arrived frenchman in a spanish uniform this frenchman and one of the german princes serving with the russian army were discussing the siege of saragossa and considering the possibility of defending moscow in a similar manner count rostopchn was telling a fourth group that he was prepared to die with the city train bands under the walls of the capital but that he still could not help regretting having been left in ignorance of what was happening and that had he known it sooner things would have been different a fifth group displaying the profundity of their strategic perceptions discussed the direction the troops would now have to take a sixth group was talking absolute nonsense kutzovs expression grew more and more preoccupied and gloomy from all this talk he saw only one thing that to defend moscow was a physical impossibility in the full meaning of those words that is to say so utterly impossible that if any senseless commander were to give orders to fight confusion would result but the battle would still not take place it would not take place because the commanders not merely all recognized the position to be impossible but in their conversations were only discussing what would happen after its inevitable abandonment how could the commanders lead their troops to a field of battle they considered impossible to hold the lower-grade officers and even the soldiers who too reason also considered the position impossible and therefore could not go to fight fully convinced as they were of defeat if bennigsen insisted on the position being defended and others still discussed it the question was no longer important in itself but only as a pretext for disputes and intrigue this kutzov knew well bennigsen who had chosen the position warmly displayed his russian patriotism kutzov could not listen to this without wincing by insisting that moscow must be defended his aim was as clear as daylight to kutzov if the defense failed to throw the blame on kutzov who had brought the army as far as the sparrow hills without giving battle if it succeeded to claim the success as his own or if battle were not given to clear himself of the crime of abandoning moscow but this intrigue did not now occupy the old mans mind one terrible question absorbed him and to that question he heard no reply from anyone the question for him now was have i really allowed napoleon to reach moscow and when did i do so when was it decided can it have been yesterday when i ordered pltov to retreat or was it the evening before when i had a nap and told bennigsen to issue orders or was it earlier still when when was this terrible affair decided moscow must be abandoned the army must retreat and the order to do so must be given to give that terrible order seemed to him equivalent to resigning the command of the army and not only did he love power to which he was accustomed the honours awarded to prince prozorvski under whom he had served in turkey galled him but he was convinced that he was destined to save russia and that that was why against the emperors wish and by the will of the people he had been chosen commander in chief he was convinced that he alone could maintain command of the army in these difficult circumstances and that in all the world he alone could encounter the invincible napoleon without fear and he was horrified at the thought of the order he had to issue but something had to be decided and these conversations around him which were assuming too free a character must be stopped he called the most important generals to him my head be it good or bad must depend on itself said he rising from the bench and he rode to fil where his carriages were waiting chapter iv the council of war began to assemble at two in the afternoon in the better and roomier part of andrew savostynovs hut the men women and children of the
