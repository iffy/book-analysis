in history innumerable instances of the fact that the size of any army does not coincide with its strength and that small detachments defeat larger ones obscurely admits the existence of this unknown factor and tries to discover it now in a geometric formation now in the equipment employed now and most usually in the genius of the commanders but the assignment of these various meanings to the factor does not yield results which accord with the historic facts yet it is only necessary to abandon the false view adopted to gratify the heroes of the efficacy of the directions issued in wartime by commanders in order to find this unknown quantity that unknown quantity is the spirit of the army that is to say the greater or lesser readiness to fight and face danger felt by all the men composing an army quite independently of whether they are or are not fighting under the command of a genius in two or three-line formation with cudgels or with rifles that repeat thirty times a minute men who want to fight will always put themselves in the most advantageous conditions for fighting the spirit of an army is the factor which multiplied by the mass gives the resulting force to define and express the significance of this unknown factor the spirit of an army is a problem for science this problem is only solvable if we cease arbitrarily to substitute for the unknown x itself the conditions under which that force becomes apparent such as the commands of the general the equipment employed and so on mistaking these for the real significance of the factor and if we recognize this unknown quantity in its entirety as being the greater or lesser desire to fight and to face danger only then expressing known historic facts by equations and comparing the relative significance of this factor can we hope to define the unknown ten men battalions or divisions fighting fifteen men battalions or divisions conquer that is kill or take captive all the others while themselves losing four so that on the one side four and on the other fifteen were lost consequently the four were equal to the fifteen and therefore x y consequently xy this equation does not give us the value of the unknown factor but gives us a ratio between two unknowns and by bringing variously selected historic units battles campaigns periods of war into such equations a series of numbers could be obtained in which certain laws should exist and might be discovered the tactical rule that an army should act in masses when attacking and in smaller groups in retreat unconsciously confirms the truth that the strength of an army depends on its spirit to lead men forward under fire more discipline obtainable only by movement in masses is needed than is needed to resist attacks but this rule which leaves out of account the spirit of the army continually proves incorrect and is in particularly striking contrast to the facts when some strong rise or fall in the spirit of the troops occurs as in all national wars the french retreating in though according to tactics they should have separated into detachments to defend themselves congregated into a mass because the spirit of the army had so fallen that only the mass held the army together the russians on the contrary ought according to tactics to have attacked in mass but in fact they split up into small units because their spirit had so risen that separate individuals without orders dealt blows at the french without needing any compulsion to induce them to expose themselves to hardships and dangers chapter iii the so-called partisan war began with the entry of the french into smolnsk before partisan warfare had been officially recognized by the government thousands of enemy stragglers marauders and foragers had been destroyed by the cossacks and the peasants who killed them off as instinctively as dogs worry a stray mad dog to death dens davdov with his russian instinct was the first to recognize the value of this terrible cudgel which regardless of the rules of military science destroyed the french and to him belongs the credit for taking the first step toward regularizing this method of warfare on august davdovs first partisan detachment was formed and then others were recognized the further the campaign progressed the more numerous these detachments became the irregulars destroyed the great army piecemeal they gathered the fallen leaves that dropped of themselves from that withered tree the french army and
