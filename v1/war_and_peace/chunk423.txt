of the window and went to the door suddenly the strange sound of a far-off whistling and thud was heard followed by a boom of cannon blending into a dull roar that set the windows rattling he went out into the street two men were running past toward the bridge from different sides came whistling sounds and the thud of cannon balls and bursting shells falling on the town but these sounds were hardly heard in comparison with the noise of the firing outside the town and attracted little attention from the inhabitants the town was being bombarded by a hundred and thirty guns which napoleon had ordered up after four oclock the people did not at once realize the meaning of this bombardment at first the noise of the falling bombs and shells only aroused curiosity ferapntovs wife who till then had not ceased wailing under the shed became quiet and with the baby in her arms went to the gate listening to the sounds and looking in silence at the people the cook and a shop assistant came to the gate with lively curiosity everyone tried to get a glimpse of the projectiles as they flew over their heads several people came round the corner talking eagerly what force remarked one knocked the roof and ceiling all to splinters routed up the earth like a pig said another thats grand it bucks one up laughed the first lucky you jumped aside or it would have wiped you out others joined those men and stopped and told how cannon balls had fallen on a house close to them meanwhile still more projectiles now with the swift sinister whistle of a cannon ball now with the agreeable intermittent whistle of a shell flew over peoples heads incessantly but not one fell close by they all flew over alptych was getting into his trap the innkeeper stood at the gate what are you staring at he shouted to the cook who in her red skirt with sleeves rolled up swinging her bare elbows had stepped to the corner to listen to what was being said what marvels she exclaimed but hearing her masters voice she turned back pulling down her tucked-up skirt once more something whistled but this time quite close swooping downwards like a little bird a flame flashed in the middle of the street something exploded and the street was shrouded in smoke scoundrel what are you doing shouted the innkeeper rushing to the cook at that moment the pitiful wailing of women was heard from different sides the frightened baby began to cry and people crowded silently with pale faces round the cook the loudest sound in that crowd was her wailing oh-h-h dear souls dear kind souls dont let me die my good souls five minutes later no one remained in the street the cook with her thigh broken by a shell splinter had been carried into the kitchen alptych his coachman ferapntovs wife and children and the house porter were all sitting in the cellar listening the roar of guns the whistling of projectiles and the piteous moaning of the cook which rose above the other sounds did not cease for a moment the mistress rocked and hushed her baby and when anyone came into the cellar asked in a pathetic whisper what had become of her husband who had remained in the street a shopman who entered told her that her husband had gone with others to the cathedral whence they were fetching the wonder-working icon of smolnsk toward dusk the cannonade began to subside alptych left the cellar and stopped in the doorway the evening sky that had been so clear was clouded with smoke through which high up the sickle of the new moon shone strangely now that the terrible din of the guns had ceased a hush seemed to reign over the town broken only by the rustle of footsteps the moaning the distant cries and the crackle of fires which seemed widespread everywhere the cooks moans had now subsided on two sides black curling clouds of smoke rose and spread from the fires through the streets soldiers in various uniforms walked or ran confusedly in different directions like ants from a ruined ant-hill several of them ran into ferapntovs yard before alptychs eyes alptych went out to the gate a retreating regiment thronging and hurrying blocked the street noticing him an officer said the town is being abandoned get away get away and then turning to the soldiers shouted ill teach you to
