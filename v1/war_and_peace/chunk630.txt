the convoy had fifteen hundred men densov had two hundred and dlokhov might have as many more but the disparity of numbers did not deter densov all that he now wanted to know was what troops these were and to learn that he had to capture a tongue that is a man from the enemy column that mornings attack on the wagons had been made so hastily that the frenchmen with the wagons had all been killed only a little drummer boy had been taken alive and as he was a straggler he could tell them nothing definite about the troops in that column densov considered it dangerous to make a second attack for fear of putting the whole column on the alert so he sent tkhon shcherbty a peasant of his party to shmshevo to try and seize at least one of the french quartermasters who had been sent on in advance chapter iv it was a warm rainy autumn day the sky and the horizon were both the color of muddy water at times a sort of mist descended and then suddenly heavy slanting rain came down densov in a felt cloak and a sheepskin cap from which the rain ran down was riding a thin thoroughbred horse with sunken sides like his horse which turned its head and laid its ears back he shrank from the driving rain and gazed anxiously before him his thin face with its short thick black beard looked angry beside densov rode an esaul densovs fellow worker also in felt cloak and sheepskin cap and riding a large sleek don horse a captain of cossacks esaul lovyski the third was a tall man as straight as an arrow pale-faced fair-haired with narrow light eyes and with calm self-satisfaction in his face and bearing though it was impossible to say in what the peculiarity of the horse and rider lay yet at first glance at the esaul and densov one saw that the latter was wet and uncomfortable and was a man mounted on a horse while looking at the esaul one saw that he was as comfortable and as much at ease as always and that he was not a man who had mounted a horse but a man who was one with his horse a being consequently possessed of twofold strength a little ahead of them walked a peasant guide wet to the skin and wearing a gray peasant coat and a white knitted cap a little behind on a poor small lean kirghz mount with an enormous tail and mane and a bleeding mouth rode a young officer in a blue french overcoat beside him rode an hussar with a boy in a tattered french uniform and blue cap behind him on the crupper of his horse the boy held on to the hussar with cold red hands and raising his eyebrows gazed about him with surprise this was the french drummer boy captured that morning behind them along the narrow sodden cut up forest road came hussars in threes and fours and then cossacks some in felt cloaks some in french greatcoats and some with horsecloths over their heads the horses being drenched by the rain all looked black whether chestnut or bay their necks with their wet close-clinging manes looked strangely thin steam rose from them clothes saddles reins were all wet slippery and sodden like the ground and the fallen leaves that strewed the road the men sat huddled up trying not to stir so as to warm the water that had trickled to their bodies and not admit the fresh cold water that was leaking in under their seats their knees and at the back of their necks in the midst of the outspread line of cossacks two wagons drawn by french horses and by saddled cossack horses that had been hitched on in front rumbled over the tree stumps and branches and splashed through the water that lay in the ruts densovs horse swerved aside to avoid a pool in the track and bumped his riders knee against a tree oh the devil exclaimed densov angrily and showing his teeth he struck his horse three times with his whip splashing himself and his comrades with mud densov was out of sorts both because of the rain and also from hunger none of them had eaten anything since morning and yet more because he still had no news from dlokhov and the man sent to capture a tongue had not returned therell hardly be another such chance to
