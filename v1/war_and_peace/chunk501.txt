flared up and while it retreated the army increased and consolidated at borodin a collision took place neither army was broken up but the russian army retreated immediately after the collision as inevitably as a ball recoils after colliding with another having a greater momentum and with equal inevitability the ball of invasion that had advanced with such momentum rolled on for some distance though the collision had deprived it of all its force the russians retreated eighty miles to beyond moscow and the french reached moscow and there came to a standstill for five weeks after that there was not a single battle the french did not move as a bleeding mortally wounded animal licks its wounds they remained inert in moscow for five weeks and then suddenly with no fresh reason fled back they made a dash for the kalga road and after a victory for at mlo-yaroslvets the field of conflict again remained theirs without undertaking a single serious battle they fled still more rapidly back to smolnsk beyond smolnsk beyond the berzina beyond vlna and farther still on the evening of the twenty-sixth of august kutzov and the whole russian army were convinced that the battle of borodin was a victory kutzov reported so to the emperor he gave orders to prepare for a fresh conflict to finish the enemy and did this not to deceive anyone but because he knew that the enemy was beaten as everyone who had taken part in the battle knew it but all that evening and next day reports came in one after another of unheard-of losses of the loss of half the army and a fresh battle proved physically impossible it was impossible to give battle before information had been collected the wounded gathered in the supplies of ammunition replenished the slain reckoned up new officers appointed to replace those who had been killed and before the men had had food and sleep and meanwhile the very next morning after the battle the french army advanced of itself upon the russians carried forward by the force of its own momentum now seemingly increased in inverse proportion to the square of the distance from its aim kutzovs wish was to attack next day and the whole army desired to do so but to make an attack the wish to do so is not sufficient there must also be a possibility of doing it and that possibility did not exist it was impossible not to retreat a days march and then in the same way it was impossible not to retreat another and a third days march and at last on the first of september when the army drew near moscow despite the strength of the feeling that had arisen in all ranks the force of circumstances compelled it to retire beyond moscow and the troops retired one more last days march and abandoned moscow to the enemy for people accustomed to think that plans of campaign and battles are made by generals as anyone of us sitting over a map in his study may imagine how he would have arranged things in this or that battle the questions present themselves why did kutzov during the retreat not do this or that why did he not take up a position before reaching fil why did he not retire at once by the kalga road abandoning moscow and so on people accustomed to think in that way forget or do not know the inevitable conditions which always limit the activities of any commander in chief the activity of a commander in chief does not at all resemble the activity we imagine to ourselves when we sit at ease in our studies examining some campaign on the map with a certain number of troops on this and that side in a certain known locality and begin our plans from some given moment a commander in chief is never dealing with the beginning of any event the position from which we always contemplate it the commander in chief is always in the midst of a series of shifting events and so he never can at any moment consider the whole import of an event that is occurring moment by moment the event is imperceptibly shaping itself and at every moment of this continuous uninterrupted shaping of events the commander in chief is in the midst of a most complex play of intrigues worries contingencies authorities projects counsels threats and deceptions and is continually obliged to reply to innumerable questions addressed to him which constantly conflict with
