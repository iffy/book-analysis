whole war obviously in spite of himself in very diverse circumstances he repeatedly expressed his real thoughts with the bitter conviction that he would not be understood beginning with the battle of borodin from which time his disagreement with those about him began he alone said that the battle of borodin was a victory and repeated this both verbally and in his dispatches and reports up to the time of his death he alone said that the loss of moscow is not the loss of russia in reply to lauristons proposal of peace he said there can be no peace for such is the peoples will he alone during the retreat of the french said that all our maneuvers are useless everything is being accomplished of itself better than we could desire that the enemy must be offered a golden bridge that neither the tartino the vyzma nor the krsnoe battles were necessary that we must keep some force to reach the frontier with and that he would not sacrifice a single russian for ten frenchmen and this courtier as he is described to us who lies to arakchev to please the emperor he alone incurring thereby the emperors displeasure said in vlna that to carry the war beyond the frontier is useless and harmful nor do words alone prove that only he understood the meaning of the events his actions without the smallest deviation were all directed to one and the same threefold end to brace all his strength for conflict with the french to defeat them and to drive them out of russia minimizing as far as possible the sufferings of our people and of our army this procrastinator kutzov whose motto was patience and time this enemy of decisive action gave battle at borodin investing the preparations for it with unparalleled solemnity this kutzov who before the battle of austerlitz began said that it would be lost he alone in contradiction to everyone else declared till his death that borodin was a victory despite the assurance of generals that the battle was lost and despite the fact that for an army to have to retire after winning a battle was unprecedented he alone during the whole retreat insisted that battles which were useless then should not be fought and that a new war should not be begun nor the frontiers of russia crossed it is easy now to understand the significance of these events if only we abstain from attributing to the activity of the mass aims that existed only in the heads of a dozen individuals for the events and results now lie before us but how did that old man alone in opposition to the general opinion so truly discern the importance of the peoples view of the events that in all his activity he was never once untrue to it the source of that extraordinary power of penetrating the meaning of the events then occuring lay in the national feeling which he possessed in full purity and strength only the recognition of the fact that he possessed this feeling caused the people in so strange a manner contrary to the tsars wish to select him an old man in disfavor to be their representative in the national war and only that feeling placed him on that highest human pedestal from which he the commander in chief devoted all his powers not to slaying and destroying men but to saving and showing pity on them that simple modest and therefore truly great figure could not be cast in the false mold of a european hero the supposed ruler of men that history has invented to a lackey no man can be great for a lackey has his own conception of greatness chapter vi the fifth of november was the first day of what is called the battle of krsnoe toward evening after much disputing and many mistakes made by generals who did not go to their proper places and after adjutants had been sent about with counterorders when it had become plain that the enemy was everywhere in flight and that there could and would be no battle kutzov left krsnoe and went to dbroe whither his headquarters had that day been transferred the day was clear and frosty kutzov rode to dbroe on his plump little white horse followed by an enormous suite of discontented generals who whispered among themselves behind his back all along the road groups of french prisoners captured that day there were seven thousand of them were crowding to warm themselves at
