field glass and shrugging his shoulders so it is theyll be fired on at the crossing and why are they dawdling there on the opposite side the enemy could be seen by the naked eye and from their battery a milk-white cloud arose then came the distant report of a shot and our troops could be seen hurrying to the crossing nesvtski rose puffing and went up to the general smiling would not your excellency like a little refreshment he said its a bad business said the general without answering him our men have been wasting time hadnt i better ride over your excellency asked nesvtski yes please do answered the general and he repeated the order that had already once been given in detail and tell the hussars that they are to cross last and to fire the bridge as i ordered and the inflammable material on the bridge must be reinspected very good answered nesvtski he called the cossack with his horse told him to put away the knapsack and flask and swung his heavy person easily into the saddle ill really call in on the nuns he said to the officers who watched him smilingly and he rode off by the winding path down the hill now then lets see how far it will carry captain just try said the general turning to an artillery officer have a little fun to pass the time crew to your guns commanded the officer in a moment the men came running gaily from their campfires and began loading one came the command number one jumped briskly aside the gun rang out with a deafening metallic roar and a whistling grenade flew above the heads of our troops below the hill and fell far short of the enemy a little smoke showing the spot where it burst the faces of officers and men brightened up at the sound everyone got up and began watching the movements of our troops below as plainly visible as if but a stones throw away and the movements of the approaching enemy farther off at the same instant the sun came fully out from behind the clouds and the clear sound of the solitary shot and the brilliance of the bright sunshine merged in a single joyous and spirited impression chapter vii two of the enemys shots had already flown across the bridge where there was a crush halfway across stood prince nesvtski who had alighted from his horse and whose big body was jammed against the railings he looked back laughing to the cossack who stood a few steps behind him holding two horses by their bridles each time prince nesvtski tried to move on soldiers and carts pushed him back again and pressed him against the railings and all he could do was to smile what a fine fellow you are friend said the cossack to a convoy soldier with a wagon who was pressing onto the infantrymen who were crowded together close to his wheels and his horses what a fellow you cant wait a moment dont you see the general wants to pass but the convoyman took no notice of the word general and shouted at the soldiers who were blocking his way hi there boys keep to the left wait a bit but the soldiers crowded together shoulder to shoulder their bayonets interlocking moved over the bridge in a dense mass looking down over the rails prince nesvtski saw the rapid noisy little waves of the enns which rippling and eddying round the piles of the bridge chased each other along looking on the bridge he saw equally uniform living waves of soldiers shoulder straps covered shakos knapsacks bayonets long muskets and under the shakos faces with broad cheekbones sunken cheeks and listless tired expressions and feet that moved through the sticky mud that covered the planks of the bridge sometimes through the monotonous waves of men like a fleck of white foam on the waves of the enns an officer in a cloak and with a type of face different from that of the men squeezed his way along sometimes like a chip of wood whirling in the river an hussar on foot an orderly or a townsman was carried through the waves of infantry and sometimes like a log floating down the river an officers or companys baggage wagon piled high leather covered and hemmed in on all sides moved across the bridge its as if a dam had burst said the cossack hopelessly are there many more of you to come
