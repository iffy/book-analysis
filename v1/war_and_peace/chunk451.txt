folded them across his stomach repeating the words for our countrys welfare well what is it speak densov blushed like a girl it was strange to see the color rise in that shaggy bibulous time-worn face and boldly began to expound his plan of cutting the enemys lines of communication between smolnsk and vyzma densov came from those parts and knew the country well his plan seemed decidedly a good one especially from the strength of conviction with which he spoke kutzov looked down at his own legs occasionally glancing at the door of the adjoining hut as if expecting something unpleasant to emerge from it and from that hut while densov was speaking a general with a portfolio under his arm really did appear what said kutzov in the midst of densovs explanations are you ready so soon ready your serene highness replied the general kutzov swayed his head as much as to say how is one man to deal with it all and again listened to densov i give my word of honor as a wussian officer said densov that i can bweak napoleons line of communication what relation are you to intendant general kirl andrevich densov asked kutzov interrupting him he is my uncle your sewene highness ah we were friends said kutzov cheerfully all right all right friend stay here at the staff and tomorrow well have a talk with a nod to densov he turned away and put out his hand for the papers konovntsyn had brought him would not your serene highness like to come inside said the general on duty in a discontented voice the plans must be examined and several papers have to be signed an adjutant came out and announced that everything was in readiness within but kutzov evidently did not wish to enter that room till he was disengaged he made a grimace no tell them to bring a small table out here my dear boy ill look at them here said he dont go away he added turning to prince andrew who remained in the porch and listened to the generals report while this was being given prince andrew heard the whisper of a womans voice and the rustle of a silk dress behind the door several times on glancing that way he noticed behind that door a plump rosy handsome woman in a pink dress with a lilac silk kerchief on her head holding a dish and evidently awaiting the entrance of the commander in chief kutzovs adjutant whispered to prince andrew that this was the wife of the priest whose home it was and that she intended to offer his serene highness bread and salt her husband has welcomed his serene highness with the cross at the church and she intends to welcome him in the house shes very pretty added the adjutant with a smile at those words kutzov looked round he was listening to the generals report which consisted chiefly of a criticism of the position at tsrevo-zaymshche as he had listened to densov and seven years previously had listened to the discussion at the austerlitz council of war he evidently listened only because he had ears which though there was a piece of tow in one of them could not help hearing but it was evident that nothing the general could say would surprise or even interest him that he knew all that would be said beforehand and heard it all only because he had to as one has to listen to the chanting of a service of prayer all that densov had said was clever and to the point what the general was saying was even more clever and to the point but it was evident that kutzov despised knowledge and cleverness and knew of something else that would decide the matter something independent of cleverness and knowledge prince andrew watched the commander in chiefs face attentively and the only expression he could see there was one of boredom curiosity as to the meaning of the feminine whispering behind the door and a desire to observe propriety it was evident that kutzov despised cleverness and learning and even the patriotic feeling shown by densov but despised them not because of his own intellect feelings or knowledge he did not try to display any of these but because of something else he despised them because of his old age and experience of life the only instruction kutzov gave of his own accord during that report referred to looting by the russian troops at the end of
