one another learned military authorities quite seriously tell us that kutzov should have moved his army to the kalga road long before reaching fil and that somebody actually submitted such a proposal to him but a commander in chief especially at a difficult moment has always before him not one proposal but dozens simultaneously and all these proposals based on strategics and tactics contradict each other a commander in chiefs business it would seem is simply to choose one of these projects but even that he cannot do events and time do not wait for instance on the twenty-eighth it is suggested to him to cross to the kalga road but just then an adjutant gallops up from milordovich asking whether he is to engage the french or retire an order must be given him at once that instant and the order to retreat carries us past the turn to the kalga road and after the adjutant comes the commissary general asking where the stores are to be taken and the chief of the hospitals asks where the wounded are to go and a courier from petersburg brings a letter from the sovereign which does not admit of the possibility of abandoning moscow and the commander in chiefs rival the man who is undermining him and there are always not merely one but several such presents a new project diametrically opposed to that of turning to the kalga road and the commander in chief himself needs sleep and refreshment to maintain his energy and a respectable general who has been overlooked in the distribution of rewards comes to complain and the inhabitants of the district pray to be defended and an officer sent to inspect the locality comes in and gives a report quite contrary to what was said by the officer previously sent and a spy a prisoner and a general who has been on reconnaissance all describe the position of the enemys army differently people accustomed to misunderstand or to forget these inevitable conditions of a commander in chiefs actions describe to us for instance the position of the army at fil and assume that the commander in chief could on the first of september quite freely decide whether to abandon moscow or defend it whereas with the russian army less than four miles from moscow no such question existed when had that question been settled at drissa and at smolnsk and most palpably of all on the twenty-fourth of august at shevrdino and on the twenty-sixth at borodin and each day and hour and minute of the retreat from borodin to fil chapter iii when ermlov having been sent by kutzov to inspect the position told the field marshal that it was impossible to fight there before moscow and that they must retreat kutzov looked at him in silence give me your hand said he and turning it over so as to feel the pulse added you are not well my dear fellow think what you are saying kutzov could not yet admit the possibility of retreating beyond moscow without a battle on the poklnny hill four miles from the dorogomlov gate of moscow kutzov got out of his carriage and sat down on a bench by the roadside a great crowd of generals gathered round him and count rostopchn who had come out from moscow joined them this brilliant company separated into several groups who all discussed the advantages and disadvantages of the position the state of the army the plans suggested the situation of moscow and military questions generally though they had not been summoned for the purpose and though it was not so called they all felt that this was really a council of war the conversations all dealt with public questions if anyone gave or asked for personal news it was done in a whisper and they immediately reverted to general matters no jokes or laughter or smiles even were seen among all these men they evidently all made an effort to hold themselves at the height the situation demanded and all these groups while talking among themselves tried to keep near the commander in chief whose bench formed the center of the gathering and to speak so that he might overhear them the commander in chief listened to what was being said and sometimes asked them to repeat their remarks but did not himself take part in the conversations or express any opinion after hearing what was being said by one or other of these groups he generally turned away with an air of
