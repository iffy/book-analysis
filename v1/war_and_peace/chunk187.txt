brawler dlokhov the bully lived in moscow with an old mother and a hunchback sister and was the most affectionate of sons and brothers chapter vi pierre had of late rarely seen his wife alone both in petersburg and in moscow their house was always full of visitors the night after the duel he did not go to his bedroom but as he often did remained in his fathers room that huge room in which count bezkhov had died he lay down on the sofa meaning to fall asleep and forget all that had happened to him but could not do so such a storm of feelings thoughts and memories suddenly arose within him that he could not fall asleep nor even remain in one place but had to jump up and pace the room with rapid steps now he seemed to see her in the early days of their marriage with bare shoulders and a languid passionate look on her face and then immediately he saw beside her dlokhovs handsome insolent hard and mocking face as he had seen it at the banquet and then that same face pale quivering and suffering as it had been when he reeled and sank on the snow what has happened he asked himself i have killed her lover yes killed my wifes lover yes that was it and why how did i come to do it because you married her answered an inner voice but in what was i to blame he asked in marrying her without loving her in deceiving yourself and her and he vividly recalled that moment after supper at prince vaslis when he spoke those words he had found so difficult to utter i love you it all comes from that even then i felt it he thought i felt then that it was not so that i had no right to do it and so it turns out he remembered his honeymoon and blushed at the recollection particularly vivid humiliating and shameful was the recollection of how one day soon after his marriage he came out of the bedroom into his study a little before noon in his silk dressing gown and found his head steward there who bowing respectfully looked into his face and at his dressing gown and smiled slightly as if expressing respectful understanding of his employers happiness but how often i have felt proud of her proud of her majestic beauty and social tact thought he been proud of my house in which she received all petersburg proud of her unapproachability and beauty so this is what i was proud of i then thought that i did not understand her how often when considering her character i have told myself that i was to blame for not understanding her for not understanding that constant composure and complacency and lack of all interests or desires and the whole secret lies in the terrible truth that she is a depraved woman now i have spoken that terrible word to myself all has become clear anatole used to come to borrow money from her and used to kiss her naked shoulders she did not give him the money but let herself be kissed her father in jest tried to rouse her jealousy and she replied with a calm smile that she was not so stupid as to be jealous let him do what he pleases she used to say of me one day i asked her if she felt any symptoms of pregnancy she laughed contemptuously and said she was not a fool to want to have children and that she was not going to have any children by me then he recalled the coarseness and bluntness of her thoughts and the vulgarity of the expressions that were natural to her though she had been brought up in the most aristocratic circles im not such a fool just you try it on allez-vous promener she used to say often seeing the success she had with young and old men and women pierre could not understand why he did not love her you clear out of this yes i never loved her said he to himself i knew she was a depraved woman he repeated but dared not admit it to myself and now theres dlokhov sitting in the snow with a forced smile and perhaps dying while meeting my remorse with some forced bravado pierre was one of those people who in spite of an appearance of what is called weak character do not seek a confidant in
