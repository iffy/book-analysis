at the same time aglow with excitement recalled every detail of yesterdays interview with anatole why could that not be as well she sometimes asked herself in complete bewilderment only so could i be completely happy but now i have to choose and i cant be happy without either of them only she thought to tell prince andrew what has happened or to hide it from him are both equally impossible but with that one nothing is spoiled but am i really to abandon forever the joy of prince andrews love in which i have lived so long please miss whispered a maid entering the room with a mysterious air a man told me to give you this and she handed natsha a letter only for christs sake the girl went on as natsha without thinking mechanically broke the seal and read a love letter from anatole of which without taking in a word she understood only that it was a letter from him from the man she loved yes she loved him or else how could that have happened which had happened and how could she have a love letter from him in her hand with trembling hands natsha held that passionate love letter which dlokhov had composed for anatole and as she read it she found in it an echo of all that she herself imagined she was feeling since yesterday evening my fate has been sealed to be loved by you or to die there is no other way for me the letter began then he went on to say that he knew her parents would not give her to him for this there were secret reasons he could reveal only to her but that if she loved him she need only say the word yes and no human power could hinder their bliss love would conquer all he would steal her away and carry her off to the ends of the earth yes yes i love him thought natsha reading the letter for the twentieth time and finding some peculiarly deep meaning in each word of it that evening mrya dmtrievna was going to the akhrovs and proposed to take the girls with her natsha pleading a headache remained at home chapter xv on returning late in the evening snya went to natshas room and to her surprise found her still dressed and asleep on the sofa open on the table beside her lay anatoles letter snya picked it up and read it as she read she glanced at the sleeping natsha trying to find in her face an explanation of what she was reading but did not find it her face was calm gentle and happy clutching her breast to keep herself from choking snya pale and trembling with fear and agitation sat down in an armchair and burst into tears how was it i noticed nothing how could it go so far can she have left off loving prince andrew and how could she let kurgin go to such lengths he is a deceiver and a villain thats plain what will nicholas dear noble nicholas do when he hears of it so this is the meaning of her excited resolute unnatural look the day before yesterday yesterday and today thought snya but it cant be that she loves him she probably opened the letter without knowing who it was from probably she is offended by it she could not do such a thing snya wiped away her tears and went up to natsha again scanning her face natsha she said just audibly natsha awoke and saw snya ah youre back and with the decision and tenderness that often come at the moment of awakening she embraced her friend but noticing snyas look of embarrassment her own face expressed confusion and suspicion snya youve read that letter she demanded yes answered snya softly natsha smiled rapturously no snya i cant any longer she said i cant hide it from you any longer you know we love one another snya darling he writes snya snya stared open-eyed at natsha unable to believe her ears and bolknski she asked ah snya if you only knew how happy i am cried natsha you dont know what love is but natsha can that be all over natsha looked at snya with wide-open eyes as if she could not grasp the question well then are you refusing prince andrew said snya oh you dont understand anything dont talk nonsense just listen said natsha with momentary vexation but i cant believe it insisted
