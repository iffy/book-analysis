revealed to me of which man cannot be deprived he thought as he lay in the semidarkness of the quiet hut gazing fixedly before him with feverish wide open eyes a happiness lying beyond material forces outside the material influences that act on man a happiness of the soul alone the happiness of loving every man can understand it but to conceive it and enjoin it was possible only for god but how did god enjoin that law and why was the son and suddenly the sequence of these thoughts broke off and prince andrew heard without knowing whether it was a delusion or reality a soft whispering voice incessantly and rhythmically repeating piti-piti-piti and then titi and then again piti-piti-piti and ti-ti once more at the same time he felt that above his face above the very middle of it some strange airy structure was being erected out of slender needles or splinters to the sound of this whispered music he felt that he had to balance carefully though it was difficult so that this airy structure should not collapse but nevertheless it kept collapsing and again slowly rising to the sound of whispered rhythmic music it stretches stretches spreading out and stretching said prince andrew to himself while listening to this whispering and feeling the sensation of this drawing out and the construction of this edifice of needles he also saw by glimpses a red halo round the candle and heard the rustle of the cockroaches and the buzzing of the fly that flopped against his pillow and his face each time the fly touched his face it gave him a burning sensation and yet to his surprise it did not destroy the structure though it knocked against the very region of his face where it was rising but besides this there was something else of importance it was something white by the door the statue of a sphinx which also oppressed him but perhaps thats my shirt on the table he thought and thats my legs and that is the door but why is it always stretching and drawing itself out and piti-piti-piti and ti-ti and piti-piti-piti thats enough please leave off prince andrew painfully entreated someone and suddenly thoughts and feelings again swam to the surface of his mind with peculiar clearness and force yes love he thought again quite clearly but not love which loves for something for some quality for some purpose or for some reason but the love which i while dying first experienced when i saw my enemy and yet loved him i experienced that feeling of love which is the very essence of the soul and does not require an object now again i feel that bliss to love ones neighbors to love ones enemies to love everything to love god in all his manifestations it is possible to love someone dear to you with human love but an enemy can only be loved by divine love that is why i experienced such joy when i felt that i loved that man what has become of him is he alive when loving with human love one may pass from love to hatred but divine love cannot change no neither death nor anything else can destroy it it is the very essence of the soul yet how many people have i hated in my life and of them all i loved and hated none as i did her and he vividly pictured to himself natsha not as he had done in the past with nothing but her charms which gave him delight but for the first time picturing to himself her soul and he understood her feelings her sufferings shame and remorse he now understood for the first time all the cruelty of his rejection of her the cruelty of his rupture with her if only it were possible for me to see her once more just once looking into those eyes to say piti-piti-piti and ti-ti and piti-piti-piti boom flopped the fly and his attention was suddenly carried into another world a world of reality and delirium in which something particular was happening in that world some structure was still being erected and did not fall something was still stretching out and the candle with its red halo was still burning and the same shirtlike sphinx lay near the door but besides all this something creaked there was a whiff of fresh air and a new white sphinx appeared standing at the door and that sphinx had the pale face and shining eyes
