him she left the room chapter v they all separated but except anatole who fell asleep as soon as he got into bed all kept awake a long time that night is he really to be my husband this stranger who is so kind yes kind that is the chief thing thought princess mary and fear which she had seldom experienced came upon her she feared to look round it seemed to her that someone was there standing behind the screen in the dark corner and this someone was he the devil and he was also this man with the white forehead black eyebrows and red lips she rang for her maid and asked her to sleep in her room mademoiselle bourienne walked up and down the conservatory for a long time that evening vainly expecting someone now smiling at someone now working herself up to tears with the imaginary words of her pauvre mre rebuking her for her fall the little princess grumbled to her maid that her bed was badly made she could not lie either on her face or on her side every position was awkward and uncomfortable and her burden oppressed her now more than ever because anatoles presence had vividly recalled to her the time when she was not like that and when everything was light and gay she sat in an armchair in her dressing jacket and nightcap and katie sleepy and disheveled beat and turned the heavy feather bed for the third time muttering to herself i told you it was all lumps and holes the little princess repeated i should be glad enough to fall asleep so its not my fault and her voice quivered like that of a child about to cry the old prince did not sleep either tkhon half asleep heard him pacing angrily about and snorting the old prince felt as though he had been insulted through his daughter the insult was the more pointed because it concerned not himself but another his daughter whom he loved more than himself he kept telling himself that he would consider the whole matter and decide what was right and how he should act but instead of that he only excited himself more and more the first man that turns up she forgets her father and everything else runs upstairs and does up her hair and wags her tail and is unlike herself glad to throw her father over and she knew i should notice it fr fr fr and dont i see that that idiot had eyes only for bourienne i shall have to get rid of her and how is it she has not pride enough to see it if she has no pride for herself she might at least have some for my sake she must be shown that the blockhead thinks nothing of her and looks only at bourienne no she has no pride but ill let her see the old prince knew that if he told his daughter she was making a mistake and that anatole meant to flirt with mademoiselle bourienne princess marys self-esteem would be wounded and his point not to be parted from her would be gained so pacifying himself with this thought he called tkhon and began to undress what devil brought them here thought he while tkhon was putting the nightshirt over his dried-up old body and gray-haired chest i never invited them they came to disturb my life and there is not much of it left devil take em he muttered while his head was still covered by the shirt tkhon knew his masters habit of sometimes thinking aloud and therefore met with unaltered looks the angrily inquisitive expression of the face that emerged from the shirt gone to bed asked the prince tkhon like all good valets instinctively knew the direction of his masters thoughts he guessed that the question referred to prince vasli and his son they have gone to bed and put out their lights your excellency no good no good said the prince rapidly and thrusting his feet into his slippers and his arms into the sleeves of his dressing gown he went to the couch on which he slept though no words had passed between anatole and mademoiselle bourienne they quite understood one another as to the first part of their romance up to the appearance of the pauvre mre they understood that they had much to say to one another in private and so they had been seeking an opportunity since morning to meet one another
