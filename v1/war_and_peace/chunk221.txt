to the exclusion of all else chapter ix bilbin was now at army headquarters in a diplomatic capacity and though he wrote in french and used french jests and french idioms he described the whole campaign with a fearless self-censure and self-derision genuinely russian bilbin wrote that the obligation of diplomatic discretion tormented him and he was happy to have in prince andrew a reliable correspondent to whom he could pour out the bile he had accumulated at the sight of all that was being done in the army the letter was old having been written before the battle at preussisch-eylau since the day of our brilliant success at austerlitz wrote bilbin as you know my dear prince i never leave headquarters i have certainly acquired a taste for war and it is just as well for me what i have seen during these last three months is incredible i begin ab ovo the enemy of the human race as you know attacks the prussians the prussians are our faithful allies who have only betrayed us three times in three years we take up their cause but it turns out that the enemy of the human race pays no heed to our fine speeches and in his rude and savage way throws himself on the prussians without giving them time to finish the parade they had begun and in two twists of the hand he breaks them to smithereens and installs himself in the palace at potsdam i most ardently desire writes the king of prussia to bonaparte that your majesty should be received and treated in my palace in a manner agreeable to yourself and in so far as circumstances allowed i have hastened to take all steps to that end may i have succeeded the prussian generals pride themselves on being polite to the french and lay down their arms at the first demand the head of the garrison at glogau with ten thousand men asks the king of prussia what he is to do if he is summoned to surrender all this is absolutely true in short hoping to settle matters by taking up a warlike attitude it turns out that we have landed ourselves in war and what is more in war on our own frontiers with and for the king of prussia we have everything in perfect order only one little thing is lacking namely a commander in chief as it was considered that the austerlitz success might have been more decisive had the commander in chief not been so young all our octogenarians were reviewed and of prozorvski and kmenski the latter was preferred the general comes to us suvrov-like in a kibtka and is received with acclamations of joy and triumph on the th the first courier arrives from petersburg the mails are taken to the field marshals room for he likes to do everything himself i am called in to help sort the letters and take those meant for us the field marshal looks on and waits for letters addressed to him we search but none are to be found the field marshal grows impatient and sets to work himself and finds letters from the emperor to count t prince v and others then he bursts into one of his wild furies and rages at everyone and everything seizes the letters opens them and reads those from the emperor addressed to others ah so thats the way they treat me no confidence in me ah ordered to keep an eye on me very well then get along with you so he writes the famous order of the day to general bennigsen i am wounded and cannot ride and consequently cannot command the army you have brought your army corps to pultsk routed here it is exposed and without fuel or forage so something must be done and as you yourself reported to count buxhwden yesterday you must think of retreating to our frontier which do today from all my riding he writes to the emperor i have got a saddle sore which coming after all my previous journeys quite prevents my riding and commanding so vast an army so i have passed on the command to the general next in seniority count buxhwden having sent him my whole staff and all that belongs to it advising him if there is a lack of bread to move farther into the interior of prussia for only one days ration of bread remains and in some regiments none at all as reported by the division commanders ostermann
