most cordial tone sire all paris regrets your absence replied de beausset as was proper but though napoleon knew that de beausset had to say something of this kind and though in his lucid moments he knew it was untrue he was pleased to hear it from him again he honored him by touching his ear i am very sorry to have made you travel so far said he sire i expected nothing less than to find you at the gates of moscow replied de beausset napoleon smiled and lifting his head absent-mindedly glanced to the right an aide-de-camp approached with gliding steps and offered him a gold snuffbox which he took yes it has happened luckily for you he said raising the open snuffbox to his nose you are fond of travel and in three days you will see moscow you surely did not expect to see that asiatic capital you will have a pleasant journey de beausset bowed gratefully at this regard for his taste for travel of which he had not till then been aware ha whats this asked napoleon noticing that all the courtiers were looking at something concealed under a cloth with courtly adroitness de beausset half turned and without turning his back to the emperor retired two steps twitching off the cloth at the same time and said a present to your majesty from the empress it was a portrait painted in bright colors by grard of the son borne to napoleon by the daughter of the emperor of austria the boy whom for some reason everyone called the king of rome a very pretty curly-headed boy with a look of the christ in the sistine madonna was depicted playing at stick and ball the ball represented the terrestrial globe and the stick in his other hand a scepter though it was not clear what the artist meant to express by depicting the so-called king of rome spiking the earth with a stick the allegory apparently seemed to napoleon as it had done to all who had seen it in paris quite clear and very pleasing the king of rome he said pointing to the portrait with a graceful gesture admirable with the natural capacity of an italian for changing the expression of his face at will he drew nearer to the portrait and assumed a look of pensive tenderness he felt that what he now said and did would be historical and it seemed to him that it would now be best for him whose grandeur enabled his son to play stick and ball with the terrestrial globe to show in contrast to that grandeur the simplest paternal tenderness his eyes grew dim he moved forward glanced round at a chair which seemed to place itself under him and sat down on it before the portrait at a single gesture from him everyone went out on tiptoe leaving the great man to himself and his emotion having sat still for a while he touched himself not knowing why the thick spot of paint representing the highest light in the portrait rose and recalled de beausset and the officer on duty he ordered the portrait to be carried outside his tent that the old guard stationed round it might not be deprived of the pleasure of seeing the king of rome the son and heir of their adored monarch and while he was doing m de beausset the honor of breakfasting with him they heard as napoleon had anticipated the rapturous cries of the officers and men of the old guard who had run up to see the portrait vive lempereur vive le roi de rome vive lempereur came those ecstatic cries after breakfast napoleon in de beaussets presence dictated his order of the day to the army short and energetic he remarked when he had read over the proclamation which he had dictated straight off without corrections it ran soldiers this is the battle you have so longed for victory depends on you it is essential for us it will give us all we need comfortable quarters and a speedy return to our country behave as you did at austerlitz friedland vtebsk and smolnsk let our remotest posterity recall your achievements this day with pride let it be said of each of you he was in the great battle before moscow before moscow repeated napoleon and inviting m de beausset who was so fond of travel to accompany him on his ride he went out of the tent to where the horses stood saddled your
