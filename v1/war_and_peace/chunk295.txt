and with densov but this is quite different i feel at peace and settled i know that no better man than he exists and i am calm and contented now not at all as before nicholas expressed his disapproval of the postponement of the marriage for a year but natsha attacked her brother with exasperation proving to him that it could not be otherwise and that it would be a bad thing to enter a family against the fathers will and that she herself wished it so you dont at all understand she said nicholas was silent and agreed with her her brother often wondered as he looked at her she did not seem at all like a girl in love and parted from her affianced husband she was even-tempered and calm and quite as cheerful as of old this amazed nicholas and even made him regard bolknskis courtship skeptically he could not believe that her fate was sealed especially as he had not seen her with prince andrew it always seemed to him that there was something not quite right about this intended marriage why this delay why no betrothal he thought once when he had touched on this topic with his mother he discovered to his surprise and somewhat to his satisfaction that in the depth of her soul she too had doubts about this marriage you see he writes said she showing her son a letter of prince andrews with that latent grudge a mother always has in regard to a daughters future married happiness he writes that he wont come before december what can be keeping him illness probably his health is very delicate dont tell natsha and dont attach importance to her being so bright thats because shes living through the last days of her girlhood but i know what she is like every time we receive a letter from him however god grant that everything turns out well she always ended with these words he is an excellent man chapter ii after reaching home nicholas was at first serious and even dull he was worried by the impending necessity of interfering in the stupid business matters for which his mother had called him home to throw off this burden as quickly as possible on the third day after his arrival he went angry and scowling and without answering questions as to where he was going to mtenkas lodge and demanded an account of everything but what an account of everything might be nicholas knew even less than the frightened and bewildered mtenka the conversation and the examination of the accounts with mtenka did not last long the village elder a peasant delegate and the village clerk who were waiting in the passage heard with fear and delight first the young counts voice roaring and snapping and rising louder and louder and then words of abuse dreadful words ejaculated one after the other robber ungrateful wretch ill hack the dog to pieces im not my father robbing us and so on then with no less fear and delight they saw how the young count red in the face and with bloodshot eyes dragged mtenka out by the scruff of the neck and applied his foot and knee to his behind with great agility at convenient moments between the words shouting be off never let me see your face here again you villain mtenka flew headlong down the six steps and ran away into the shrubbery this shrubbery was a well-known haven of refuge for culprits at otrdnoe mtenka himself returning tipsy from the town used to hide there and many of the residents at otrdnoe hiding from mtenka knew of its protective qualities mtenkas wife and sisters-in-law thrust their heads and frightened faces out of the door of a room where a bright samovar was boiling and where the stewards high bedstead stood with its patchwork quilt the young count paid no heed to them but breathing hard passed by with resolute strides and went into the house the countess who heard at once from the maids what had happened at the lodge was calmed by the thought that now their affairs would certainly improve but on the other hand felt anxious as to the effect this excitement might have on her son she went several times to his door on tiptoe and listened as he lighted one pipe after another next day the old count called his son aside and with an embarrassed smile said to him but you know my dear boy its a pity
