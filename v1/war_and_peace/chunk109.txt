his eyes can they be french he looked at the approaching frenchmen and though but a moment before he had been galloping to get at them and hack them to pieces their proximity now seemed so awful that he could not believe his eyes who are they why are they running can they be coming at me and why to kill me me whom everyone is so fond of he remembered his mothers love for him and his familys and his friends and the enemys intention to kill him seemed impossible but perhaps they may do it for more than ten seconds he stood not moving from the spot or realizing the situation the foremost frenchman the one with the hooked nose was already so close that the expression of his face could be seen and the excited alien face of that man his bayonet hanging down holding his breath and running so lightly frightened rostv he seized his pistol and instead of firing it flung it at the frenchman and ran with all his might toward the bushes he did not now run with the feeling of doubt and conflict with which he had trodden the enns bridge but with the feeling of a hare fleeing from the hounds one single sentiment that of fear for his young and happy life possessed his whole being rapidly leaping the furrows he fled across the field with the impetuosity he used to show at catchplay now and then turning his good-natured pale young face to look back a shudder of terror went through him no better not look he thought but having reached the bushes he glanced round once more the french had fallen behind and just as he looked round the first man changed his run to a walk and turning shouted something loudly to a comrade farther back rostv paused no theres some mistake thought he they cant have wanted to kill me but at the same time his left arm felt as heavy as if a seventy-pound weight were tied to it he could run no more the frenchman also stopped and took aim rostv closed his eyes and stooped down one bullet and then another whistled past him he mustered his last remaining strength took hold of his left hand with his right and reached the bushes behind these were some russian sharpshooters chapter xx the infantry regiments that had been caught unawares in the outskirts of the wood ran out of it the different companies getting mixed and retreated as a disorderly crowd one soldier in his fear uttered the senseless cry cut off that is so terrible in battle and that word infected the whole crowd with a feeling of panic surrounded cut off were lost shouted the fugitives the moment he heard the firing and the cry from behind the general realized that something dreadful had happened to his regiment and the thought that he an exemplary officer of many years service who had never been to blame might be held responsible at headquarters for negligence or inefficiency so staggered him that forgetting the recalcitrant cavalry colonel his own dignity as a general and above all quite forgetting the danger and all regard for self-preservation he clutched the crupper of his saddle and spurring his horse galloped to the regiment under a hail of bullets which fell around but fortunately missed him his one desire was to know what was happening and at any cost correct or remedy the mistake if he had made one so that he an exemplary officer of twenty-two years service who had never been censured should not be held to blame having galloped safely through the french he reached a field behind the copse across which our men regardless of orders were running and descending the valley that moment of moral hesitation which decides the fate of battles had arrived would this disorderly crowd of soldiers attend to the voice of their commander or would they disregarding him continue their flight despite his desperate shouts that used to seem so terrible to the soldiers despite his furious purple countenance distorted out of all likeness to his former self and the flourishing of his saber the soldiers all continued to run talking firing into the air and disobeying orders the moral hesitation which decided the fate of battles was evidently culminating in a panic the general had a fit of coughing as a result of shouting and of the powder smoke and stopped in despair everything seemed lost but at that moment
