that to marry hlne would be a calamity and that he ought to avoid her and go away pierre despite that decision had not left prince vaslis and felt with terror that in peoples eyes he was every day more and more connected with her that it was impossible for him to return to his former conception of her that he could not break away from her and that though it would be a terrible thing he would have to unite his fate with hers he might perhaps have been able to free himself but that prince vasli who had rarely before given receptions now hardly let a day go by without having an evening party at which pierre had to be present unless he wished to spoil the general pleasure and disappoint everyones expectation prince vasli in the rare moments when he was at home would take pierres hand in passing and draw it downwards or absent-mindedly hold out his wrinkled clean-shaven cheek for pierre to kiss and would say till tomorrow or be in to dinner or i shall not see you or i am staying in for your sake and so on and though prince vasli when he stayed in as he said for pierres sake hardly exchanged a couple of words with him pierre felt unable to disappoint him every day he said to himself one and the same thing it is time i understood her and made up my mind what she really is was i mistaken before or am i mistaken now no she is not stupid she is an excellent girl he sometimes said to himself she never makes a mistake never says anything stupid she says little but what she does say is always clear and simple so she is not stupid she never was abashed and is not abashed now so she cannot be a bad woman he had often begun to make reflections or think aloud in her company and she had always answered him either by a brief but appropriate remark showing that it did not interest her or by a silent look and smile which more palpably than anything else showed pierre her superiority she was right in regarding all arguments as nonsense in comparison with that smile she always addressed him with a radiantly confiding smile meant for him alone in which there was something more significant than in the general smile that usually brightened her face pierre knew that everyone was waiting for him to say a word and cross a certain line and he knew that sooner or later he would step across it but an incomprehensible terror seized him at the thought of that dreadful step a thousand times during that month and a half while he felt himself drawn nearer and nearer to that dreadful abyss pierre said to himself what am i doing i need resolution can it be that i have none he wished to take a decision but felt with dismay that in this matter he lacked that strength of will which he had known in himself and really possessed pierre was one of those who are only strong when they feel themselves quite innocent and since that day when he was overpowered by a feeling of desire while stooping over the snuffbox at anna pvlovnas an unacknowledged sense of the guilt of that desire paralyzed his will on hlnes name day a small party of just their own people as his wife said met for supper at prince vaslis all these friends and relations had been given to understand that the fate of the young girl would be decided that evening the visitors were seated at supper princess kurgina a portly imposing woman who had once been handsome was sitting at the head of the table on either side of her sat the more important guests an old general and his wife and anna pvlovna schrer at the other end sat the younger and less important guests and there too sat the members of the family and pierre and hlne side by side prince vasli was not having any supper he went round the table in a merry mood sitting down now by one now by another of the guests to each of them he made some careless and agreeable remark except to pierre and hlne whose presence he seemed not to notice he enlivened the whole party the wax candles burned brightly the silver and crystal gleamed so did the ladies toilets and the gold and silver of the mens
