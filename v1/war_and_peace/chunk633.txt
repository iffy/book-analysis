the french and asked if no french had strayed that way the elder replied that some more-orderers had really been at their village but that tkhon shcherbty was the only man who dealt with such matters densov had tkhon called and having praised him for his activity said a few words in the elders presence about loyalty to the tsar and the country and the hatred of the french that all sons of the fatherland should cherish we dont do the french any harm said tkhon evidently frightened by densovs words we only fooled about with the lads for fun you know we killed a score or so of more-orderers but we did no harm else next day when densov had left pokrvsk having quite forgotten about this peasant it was reported to him that tkhon had attached himself to their party and asked to be allowed to remain with it densov gave orders to let him do so tkhon who at first did rough work laying campfires fetching water flaying dead horses and so on soon showed a great liking and aptitude for partisan warfare at night he would go out for booty and always brought back french clothing and weapons and when told to would bring in french captives also densov then relieved him from drudgery and began taking him with him when he went out on expeditions and had him enrolled among the cossacks tkhon did not like riding and always went on foot never lagging behind the cavalry he was armed with a musketoon which he carried rather as a joke a pike and an ax which latter he used as a wolf uses its teeth with equal ease picking fleas out of its fur or crunching thick bones tkhon with equal accuracy would split logs with blows at arms length or holding the head of the ax would cut thin little pegs or carve spoons in densovs party he held a peculiar and exceptional position when anything particularly difficult or nasty had to be done to push a cart out of the mud with ones shoulders pull a horse out of a swamp by its tail skin it slink in among the french or walk more than thirty miles in a day everybody pointed laughingly at tkhon it wont hurt that devil hes as strong as a horse they said of him once a frenchman tkhon was trying to capture fired a pistol at him and shot him in the fleshy part of the back that wound which tkhon treated only with internal and external applications of vodka was the subject of the liveliest jokes by the whole detachment jokes in which tkhon readily joined hallo mate never again gave you a twist the cossacks would banter him and tkhon purposely writhing and making faces pretended to be angry and swore at the french with the funniest curses the only effect of this incident on tkhon was that after being wounded he seldom brought in prisoners he was the bravest and most useful man in the party no one found more opportunities for attacking no one captured or killed more frenchmen and consequently he was made the buffoon of all the cossacks and hussars and willingly accepted that role now he had been sent by densov overnight to shmshevo to capture a tongue but whether because he had not been content to take only one frenchman or because he had slept through the night he had crept by day into some bushes right among the french and as densov had witnessed from above had been detected by them chapter vi after talking for some time with the esaul about next days attack which now seeing how near they were to the french he seemed to have definitely decided on densov turned his horse and rode back now my lad well go and get dwy he said to ptya as they approached the watchhouse densov stopped peering into the forest among the trees a man with long legs and long swinging arms wearing a short jacket bast shoes and a kazn hat was approaching with long light steps he had a musketoon over his shoulder and an ax stuck in his girdle when he espied densov he hastily threw something into the bushes removed his sodden hat by its floppy brim and approached his commander it was tkhon his wrinkled and pockmarked face and narrow little eyes beamed with self-satisfied merriment he lifted his head high and gazed at densov as if repressing a laugh well where did
