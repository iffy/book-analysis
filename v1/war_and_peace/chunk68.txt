the men should continue to march at ease and he and all his suite showed pleasure at the sound of the singing and the sight of the dancing soldier and the gay and smartly marching men in the second file from the right flank beside which the carriage passed the company a blue-eyed soldier involuntarily attracted notice it was dlokhov marching with particular grace and boldness in time to the song and looking at those driving past as if he pitied all who were not at that moment marching with the company the hussar cornet of kutzovs suite who had mimicked the regimental commander fell back from the carriage and rode up to dlokhov hussar cornet zherkv had at one time in petersburg belonged to the wild set led by dlokhov zherkv had met dlokhov abroad as a private and had not seen fit to recognize him but now that kutzov had spoken to the gentleman ranker he addressed him with the cordiality of an old friend my dear fellow how are you said he through the singing making his horse keep pace with the company how am i dlokhov answered coldly i am as you see the lively song gave a special flavor to the tone of free and easy gaiety with which zherkv spoke and to the intentional coldness of dlokhovs reply and how do you get on with the officers inquired zherkv all right they are good fellows and how have you wriggled onto the staff i was attached im on duty both were silent she let the hawk fly upward from her wide right sleeve went the song arousing an involuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness their conversation would probably have been different but for the effect of that song is it true that austrians have been beaten asked dlokhov the devil only knows they say so im glad answered dlokhov briefly and clearly as the song demanded i say come round some evening and well have a game of faro said zherkv why have you too much money do come i cant ive sworn not to i wont drink and wont play till i get reinstated well thats only till the first engagement we shall see they were again silent come if you need anything one can at least be of use on the staff dlokhov smiled dont trouble if i want anything i wont beg ill take it well never mind i only and i only good-by good health its a long long way to my native land zherkv touched his horse with the spurs it pranced excitedly from foot to foot uncertain with which to start then settled down galloped past the company and overtook the carriage still keeping time to the song chapter iii on returning from the review kutzov took the austrian general into his private room and calling his adjutant asked for some papers relating to the condition of the troops on their arrival and the letters that had come from the archduke ferdinand who was in command of the advanced army prince andrew bolknski came into the room with the required papers kutzov and the austrian member of the hofkriegsrath were sitting at the table on which a plan was spread out ah said kutzov glancing at bolknski as if by this exclamation he was asking the adjutant to wait and he went on with the conversation in french all i can say general said he with a pleasant elegance of expression and intonation that obliged one to listen to each deliberately spoken word it was evident that kutzov himself listened with pleasure to his own voice all i can say general is that if the matter depended on my personal wishes the will of his majesty the emperor francis would have been fulfilled long ago i should long ago have joined the archduke and believe me on my honour that to me personally it would be a pleasure to hand over the supreme command of the army into the hands of a better informed and more skillful general of whom austria has so many and to lay down all this heavy responsibility but circumstances are sometimes too strong for us general and kutzov smiled in a way that seemed to say you are quite at liberty not to believe me and i dont even care whether you do or not but you have no grounds for telling me so and that is the whole point the austrian general looked dissatisfied but had no option but to reply in the same tone
