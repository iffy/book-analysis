necessity of sending reinforcements he swore on his honor that the russians were lost if the emperor would give another division napoleon shrugged his shoulders and continued to pace up and down without replying belliard began talking loudly and eagerly to the generals of the suite around him you are very fiery belliard said napoleon when he again came up to the general in the heat of a battle it is easy to make a mistake go and have another look and then come back to me before belliard was out of sight a messenger from another part of the battlefield galloped up now then what do you want asked napoleon in the tone of a man irritated at being continually disturbed sire the prince began the adjutant asks for reinforcements said napoleon with an angry gesture the adjutant bent his head affirmatively and began to report but the emperor turned from him took a couple of steps stopped came back and called berthier we must give reserves he said moving his arms slightly apart who do you think should be sent there he asked of berthier whom he subsequently termed that gosling i have made an eagle send clapardes division sire replied berthier who knew all the divisions regiments and battalions by heart napoleon nodded assent the adjutant galloped to clapardes division and a few minutes later the young guards stationed behind the knoll moved forward napoleon gazed silently in that direction no he suddenly said to berthier i cant send claparde send friants division though there was no advantage in sending friants division instead of clapardes and even an obvious inconvenience and delay in stopping claparde and sending friant now the order was carried out exactly napoleon did not notice that in regard to his army he was playing the part of a doctor who hinders by his medicines a role he so justly understood and condemned friants division disappeared as the others had done into the smoke of the battlefield from all sides adjutants continued to arrive at a gallop and as if by agreement all said the same thing they all asked for reinforcements and all said that the russians were holding their positions and maintaining a hellish fire under which the french army was melting away napoleon sat on a campstool wrapped in thought m de beausset the man so fond of travel having fasted since morning came up to the emperor and ventured respectfully to suggest lunch to his majesty i hope i may now congratulate your majesty on a victory said he napoleon silently shook his head in negation assuming the negation to refer only to the victory and not to the lunch m de beausset ventured with respectful jocularity to remark that there is no reason for not having lunch when one can get it go away exclaimed napoleon suddenly and morosely and turned aside a beatific smile of regret repentance and ecstasy beamed on m de beaussets face and he glided away to the other generals napoleon was experiencing a feeling of depression like that of an ever-lucky gambler who after recklessly flinging money about and always winning suddenly just when he has calculated all the chances of the game finds that the more he considers his play the more surely he loses his troops were the same his generals the same the same preparations had been made the same dispositions and the same proclamation courte et nergique he himself was still the same he knew that and knew that he was now even more experienced and skillful than before even the enemy was the same as at austerlitz and friedland yet the terrible stroke of his arm had supernaturally become impotent all the old methods that had been unfailingly crowned with success the concentration of batteries on one point an attack by reserves to break the enemys line and a cavalry attack by the men of iron all these methods had already been employed yet not only was there no victory but from all sides came the same news of generals killed and wounded of reinforcements needed of the impossibility of driving back the russians and of disorganization among his own troops formerly after he had given two or three orders and uttered a few phrases marshals and adjutants had come galloping up with congratulations and happy faces announcing the trophies taken the corps of prisoners bundles of enemy eagles and standards cannon and stores and murat had only begged leave to loose the cavalry to gather in the baggage wagons so
