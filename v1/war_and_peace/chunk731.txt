as living a man is only conscious of himself as a living being by the fact that he wills that is is conscious of his volition but his will which forms the essence of his life man recognizes and can but recognize as free if observing himself man sees that his will is always directed by one and the same law whether he observes the necessity of taking food using his brain or anything else he cannot recognize this never-varying direction of his will otherwise than as a limitation of it were it not free it could not be limited a mans will seems to him to be limited just because he is not conscious of it except as free you say i am not free but i have lifted my hand and let it fall everyone understands that this illogical reply is an irrefutable demonstration of freedom that reply is the expression of a consciousness that is not subject to reason if the consciousness of freedom were not a separate and independent source of self-consciousness it would be subject to reasoning and to experience but in fact such subjection does not exist and is inconceivable a series of experiments and arguments proves to every man that he as an object of observation is subject to certain laws and man submits to them and never resists the laws of gravity or impermeability once he has become acquainted with them but the same series of experiments and arguments proves to him that the complete freedom of which he is conscious in himself is impossible and that his every action depends on his organization his character and the motives acting upon him yet man never submits to the deductions of these experiments and arguments having learned from experiment and argument that a stone falls downwards a man indubitably believes this and always expects the law that he has learned to be fulfilled but learning just as certainly that his will is subject to laws he does not and cannot believe this however often experiment and reasoning may show a man that under the same conditions and with the same character he will do the same thing as before yet when under the same conditions and with the same character he approaches for the thousandth time the action that always ends in the same way he feels as certainly convinced as before the experiment that he can act as he pleases every man savage or sage however incontestably reason and experiment may prove to him that it is impossible to imagine two different courses of action in precisely the same conditions feels that without this irrational conception which constitutes the essence of freedom he cannot imagine life he feels that however impossible it may be it is so for without this conception of freedom not only would he be unable to understand life but he would be unable to live for a single moment he could not live because all mans efforts all his impulses to life are only efforts to increase freedom wealth and poverty fame and obscurity power and subordination strength and weakness health and disease culture and ignorance work and leisure repletion and hunger virtue and vice are only greater or lesser degrees of freedom a man having no freedom cannot be conceived of except as deprived of life if the conception of freedom appears to reason to be a senseless contradiction like the possibility of performing two actions at one and the same instant of time or of an effect without a cause that only proves that consciousness is not subject to reason this unshakable irrefutable consciousness of freedom uncontrolled by experiment or argument recognized by all thinkers and felt by everyone without exception this consciousness without which no conception of man is possible constitutes the other side of the question man is the creation of an all-powerful all-good and all-seeing god what is sin the conception of which arises from the consciousness of mans freedom that is a question for theology the actions of men are subject to general immutable laws expressed in statistics what is mans responsibility to society the conception of which results from the conception of freedom that is a question for jurisprudence mans actions proceed from his innate character and the motives acting upon him what is conscience and the perception of right and wrong in actions that follows from the consciousness of freedom that is a question for ethics man in connection with the general life of humanity appears subject to laws which determine that
