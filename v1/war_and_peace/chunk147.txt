just over when prince andrew accompanied by bors arrived at the palace to find dolgorkov everyone at headquarters was still under the spell of the days council at which the party of the young had triumphed the voices of those who counseled delay and advised waiting for something else before advancing had been so completely silenced and their arguments confuted by such conclusive evidence of the advantages of attacking that what had been discussed at the council the coming battle and the victory that would certainly result from it no longer seemed to be in the future but in the past all the advantages were on our side our enormous forces undoubtedly superior to napoleons were concentrated in one place the troops inspired by the emperors presence were eager for action the strategic position where the operations would take place was familiar in all its details to the austrian general weyrother a lucky accident had ordained that the austrian army should maneuver the previous year on the very fields where the french had now to be fought the adjacent locality was known and shown in every detail on the maps and bonaparte evidently weakened was undertaking nothing dolgorkov one of the warmest advocates of an attack had just returned from the council tired and exhausted but eager and proud of the victory that had been gained prince andrew introduced his protg but prince dolgorkov politely and firmly pressing his hand said nothing to bors and evidently unable to suppress the thoughts which were uppermost in his mind at that moment addressed prince andrew in french ah my dear fellow what a battle we have gained god grant that the one that will result from it will be as victorious however dear fellow he said abruptly and eagerly i must confess to having been unjust to the austrians and especially to weyrother what exactitude what minuteness what knowledge of the locality what foresight for every eventuality every possibility even to the smallest detail no my dear fellow no conditions better than our present ones could have been devised this combination of austrian precision with russian valor what more could be wished for so the attack is definitely resolved on asked bolknski and do you know my dear fellow it seems to me that bonaparte has decidedly lost bearings you know that a letter was received from him today for the emperor dolgorkov smiled significantly is that so and what did he say inquired bolknski what can he say tra-di-ri-di-ra and so on merely to gain time i tell you he is in our hands thats certain but what was most amusing he continued with a sudden good-natured laugh was that we could not think how to address the reply if not as consul and of course not as emperor it seemed to me it should be to general bonaparte but between not recognizing him as emperor and calling him general bonaparte there is a difference remarked bolknski thats just it interrupted dolgorkov quickly laughing you know bilbin hes a very clever fellow he suggested addressing him as usurper and enemy of mankind dolgorkov laughed merrily only that said bolknski all the same it was bilbin who found a suitable form for the address he is a wise and clever fellow what was it to the head of the french government au chef du gouvernement franais said dolgorkov with grave satisfaction good wasnt it yes but he will dislike it extremely said bolknski oh yes very much my brother knows him hes dined with him the present emperor more than once in paris and tells me he never met a more cunning or subtle diplomatist you know a combination of french adroitness and italian play-acting do you know the tale about him and count markv count markv was the only man who knew how to handle him you know the story of the handkerchief it is delightful and the talkative dolgorkov turning now to bors now to prince andrew told how bonaparte wishing to test markv our ambassador purposely dropped a handkerchief in front of him and stood looking at markv probably expecting markv to pick it up for him and how markv immediately dropped his own beside it and picked it up without touching bonapartes delightful said bolknski but i have come to you prince as a petitioner on behalf of this young man you see but before prince andrew could finish an aide-de-camp came in to summon dolgorkov to the emperor oh what a nuisance said dolgorkov getting up hurriedly and pressing
