will of the people is always transferred to the men whom we have noticed it happens that the activity of the millions who migrate burn houses abandon agriculture and destroy one another never is expressed in the account of the activity of some dozen people who did not burn houses practice agriculture or slay their fellow creatures history proves this at every turn is the ferment of the peoples of the west at the end of the eighteenth century and their drive eastward explained by the activity of louis xiv xv and xvi their mistresses and ministers and by the lives of napoleon rousseau diderot beaumarchais and others is the movement of the russian people eastward to kazn and siberia expressed by details of the morbid character of ivn the terrible and by his correspondence with krbski is the movement of the peoples at the time of the crusades explained by the life and activity of the godfreys and the louis-es and their ladies for us that movement of the peoples from west to east without leaders with a crowd of vagrants and with peter the hermit remains incomprehensible and yet more incomprehensible is the cessation of that movement when a rational and sacred aim for the crusade the deliverance of jerusalem had been clearly defined by historic leaders popes kings and knights incited the peoples to free the holy land but the people did not go for the unknown cause which had previously impelled them to go no longer existed the history of the godfreys and the minnesingers can evidently not cover the life of the peoples and the history of the godfreys and the minnesingers has remained the history of godfreys and minnesingers but the history of the life of the peoples and their impulses has remained unknown still less does the history of authors and reformers explain to us the life of the peoples the history of culture explains to us the impulses and conditions of life and thought of a writer or a reformer we learn that luther had a hot temper and said such and such things we learn that rousseau was suspicious and wrote such and such books but we do not learn why after the reformation the peoples massacred one another nor why during the french revolution they guillotined one another if we unite both these kinds of history as is done by the newest historians we shall have the history of monarchs and writers but not the history of the life of the peoples chapter v the life of the nations is not contained in the lives of a few men for the connection between those men and the nations has not been found the theory that this connection is based on the transference of the collective will of a people to certain historical personages is an hypothesis unconfirmed by the experience of history the theory of the transference of the collective will of the people to historic persons may perhaps explain much in the domain of jurisprudence and be essential for its purposes but in its application to history as soon as revolutions conquests or civil wars occur that is as soon as history begins that theory explains nothing the theory seems irrefutable just because the act of transference of the peoples will cannot be verified for it never occurred whatever happens and whoever may stand at the head of affairs the theory can always say that such and such a person took the lead because the collective will was transferred to him the replies this theory gives to historical questions are like the replies of a man who watching the movements of a herd of cattle and paying no attention to the varying quality of the pasturage in different parts of the field or to the driving of the herdsman should attribute the direction the herd takes to what animal happens to be at its head the herd goes in that direction because the animal in front leads it and the collective will of all the other animals is vested in that leader this is what historians of the first class say those who assume the unconditional transference of the peoples will if the animals leading the herd change this happens because the collective will of all the animals is transferred from one leader to another according to whether the animal is or is not leading them in the direction selected by the whole herd such is the reply historians who assume that the collective will of the people is delegated to
