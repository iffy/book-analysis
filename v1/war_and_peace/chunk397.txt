it wants to have a place rubbed that has been hurt a child knocks itself and runs at once to the arms of its mother or nurse to have the aching spot rubbed or kissed and it feels better when this is done the child cannot believe that the strongest and wisest of its people have no remedy for its pain and the hope of relief and the expression of its mothers sympathy while she rubs the bump comforts it the doctors were of use to natsha because they kissed and rubbed her bump assuring her that it would soon pass if only the coachman went to the chemists in the arbt and got a powder and some pills in a pretty box for a ruble and seventy kopeks and if she took those powders in boiled water at intervals of precisely two hours neither more nor less what would snya and the count and countess have done how would they have looked if nothing had been done if there had not been those pills to give by the clock the warm drinks the chicken cutlets and all the other details of life ordered by the doctors the carrying out of which supplied an occupation and consolation to the family circle how would the count have borne his dearly loved daughters illness had he not known that it was costing him a thousand rubles and that he would not grudge thousands more to benefit her or had he not known that if her illness continued he would not grudge yet other thousands and would take her abroad for consultations there and had he not been able to explain the details of how mtivier and feller had not understood the symptoms but frise had and mdrov had diagnosed them even better what would the countess have done had she not been able sometimes to scold the invalid for not strictly obeying the doctors orders youll never get well like that she would say forgetting her grief in her vexation if you wont obey the doctor and take your medicine at the right time you mustnt trifle with it you know or it may turn to pneumonia she would go on deriving much comfort from the utterance of that foreign word incomprehensible to others as well as to herself what would snya have done without the glad consciousness that she had not undressed during the first three nights in order to be ready to carry out all the doctors injunctions with precision and that she still kept awake at night so as not to miss the proper time when the slightly harmful pills in the little gilt box had to be administered even to natsha herself it was pleasant to see that so many sacrifices were being made for her sake and to know that she had to take medicine at certain hours though she declared that no medicine would cure her and that it was all nonsense and it was even pleasant to be able to show by disregarding the orders that she did not believe in medical treatment and did not value her life the doctor came every day felt her pulse looked at her tongue and regardless of her grief-stricken face joked with her but when he had gone into another room to which the countess hurriedly followed him he assumed a grave air and thoughtfully shaking his head said that though there was danger he had hopes of the effect of this last medicine and one must wait and see that the malady was chiefly mental but and the countess trying to conceal the action from herself and from him slipped a gold coin into his hand and always returned to the patient with a more tranquil mind the symptoms of natshas illness were that she ate little slept little coughed and was always low-spirited the doctors said that she could not get on without medical treatment so they kept her in the stifling atmosphere of the town and the rostvs did not move to the country that summer of in spite of the many pills she swallowed and the drops and powders out of the little bottles and boxes of which madame schoss who was fond of such things made a large collection and in spite of being deprived of the country life to which she was accustomed youth prevailed natshas grief began to be overlaid by the impressions of daily life it ceased to press so painfully on her heart it gradually faded into the past and she
