vasli continued let the bold and insolent goliath from the borders of france encompass the realms of russia with death-bearing terrors humble faith the sling of the russian david shall suddenly smite his head in his bloodthirsty pride this icon of the venerable sergius the servant of god and zealous champion of old of our countrys weal is offered to your imperial majesty i grieve that my waning strength prevents rejoicing in the sight of your most gracious presence i raise fervent prayers to heaven that the almighty may exalt the race of the just and mercifully fulfill the desires of your majesty what force what a style was uttered in approval both of reader and of author animated by that address anna pvlovnas guests talked for a long time of the state of the fatherland and offered various conjectures as to the result of the battle to be fought in a few days you will see said anna pvlovna that tomorrow on the emperors birthday we shall receive news i have a favorable presentiment chapter ii anna pvlovnas presentiment was in fact fulfilled next day during the service at the palace church in honor of the emperors birthday prince volknski was called out of the church and received a dispatch from prince kutzov it was kutzovs report written from tatrinova on the day of the battle kutzov wrote that the russians had not retreated a step that the french losses were much heavier than ours and that he was writing in haste from the field of battle before collecting full information it followed that there must have been a victory and at once without leaving the church thanks were rendered to the creator for his help and for the victory anna pvlovnas presentiment was justified and all that morning a joyously festive mood reigned in the city everyone believed the victory to have been complete and some even spoke of napoleons having been captured of his deposition and of the choice of a new ruler for france it is very difficult for events to be reflected in their real strength and completeness amid the conditions of court life and far from the scene of action general events involuntarily group themselves around some particular incident so now the courtiers pleasure was based as much on the fact that the news had arrived on the emperors birthday as on the fact of the victory itself it was like a successfully arranged surprise mention was made in kutzovs report of the russian losses among which figured the names of tchkov bagratin and kutysov in the petersburg world this sad side of the affair again involuntarily centered round a single incident kutysovs death everybody knew him the emperor liked him and he was young and interesting that day everyone met with the words what a wonderful coincidence just during the service but what a loss kutysov is how sorry i am what did i tell about kutzov prince vasli now said with a prophets pride i always said he was the only man capable of defeating napoleon but next day no news arrived from the army and the public mood grew anxious the courtiers suffered because of the suffering the suspense occasioned the emperor fancy the emperors position said they and instead of extolling kutzov as they had done the day before they condemned him as the cause of the emperors anxiety that day prince vasli no longer boasted of his protg kutzov but remained silent when the commander in chief was mentioned moreover toward evening as if everything conspired to make petersburg society anxious and uneasy a terrible piece of news was added countess hlne bezkhova had suddenly died of that terrible malady it had been so agreeable to mention officially at large gatherings everyone said that countess bezkhova had died of a terrible attack of angina pectoris but in intimate circles details were mentioned of how the private physician of the queen of spain had prescribed small doses of a certain drug to produce a certain effect but hlne tortured by the fact that the old count suspected her and that her husband to whom she had written that wretched profligate pierre had not replied had suddenly taken a very large dose of the drug and had died in agony before assistance could be rendered her it was said that prince vasli and the old count had turned upon the italian but the latter had produced such letters from the unfortunate deceased that they had immediately let the matter drop talk in general
