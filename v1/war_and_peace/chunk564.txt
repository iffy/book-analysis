pas cried a voice you cant pass this way uncle cried the girl well pass through the side street by the niklins pierre turned back giving a spring now and then to keep up with her she ran across the street turned down a side street to the left and passing three houses turned into a yard on the right its here close by said she and running across the yard opened a gate in a wooden fence and stopping pointed out to him a small wooden wing of the house which was burning brightly and fiercely one of its sides had fallen in another was on fire and bright flames issued from the openings of the windows and from under the roof as pierre passed through the fence gate he was enveloped by hot air and involuntarily stopped which is it which is your house he asked ooh wailed the girl pointing to the wing thats it that was our lodging youve burned to death our treasure katie my precious little missy ooh lamented anska who at the sight of the fire felt that she too must give expression to her feelings pierre rushed to the wing but the heat was so great that he involuntarily passed round in a curve and came upon the large house that was as yet burning only at one end just below the roof and around which swarmed a crowd of frenchmen at first pierre did not realize what these men who were dragging something out were about but seeing before him a frenchman hitting a peasant with a blunt saber and trying to take from him a fox-fur coat he vaguely understood that looting was going on there but he had no time to dwell on that idea the sounds of crackling and the din of falling walls and ceilings the whistle and hiss of the flames the excited shouts of the people and the sight of the swaying smoke now gathering into thick black clouds and now soaring up with glittering sparks with here and there dense sheaves of flame now red and now like golden fish scales creeping along the walls and the heat and smoke and rapidity of motion produced on pierre the usual animating effects of a conflagration it had a peculiarly strong effect on him because at the sight of the fire he felt himself suddenly freed from the ideas that had weighed him down he felt young bright adroit and resolute he ran round to the other side of the lodge and was about to dash into that part of it which was still standing when just above his head he heard several voices shouting and then a cracking sound and the ring of something heavy falling close beside him pierre looked up and saw at a window of the large house some frenchmen who had just thrown out the drawer of a chest filled with metal articles other french soldiers standing below went up to the drawer what does this fellow want shouted one of them referring to pierre theres a child in that house havent you seen a child cried pierre whats he talking about get along said several voices and one of the soldiers evidently afraid that pierre might want to take from them some of the plate and bronzes that were in the drawer moved threateningly toward him a child shouted a frenchman from above i did hear something squealing in the garden perhaps its his brat that the fellow is looking for after all one must be human you know where is it where said pierre there there shouted the frenchman at the window pointing to the garden at the back of the house wait a bit im coming down and a minute or two later the frenchman a black-eyed fellow with a spot on his cheek in shirt sleeves really did jump out of a window on the ground floor and clapping pierre on the shoulder ran with him into the garden hurry up you others he called out to his comrades its getting hot when they reached a gravel path behind the house the frenchman pulled pierre by the arm and pointed to a round graveled space where a three-year-old girl in a pink dress was lying under a seat there is your child oh a girl so much the better said the frenchman good-by fatty we must be human we are all mortal you know and the frenchman with the spot on his cheek ran back to his comrades breathless
