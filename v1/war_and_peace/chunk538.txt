kutzov this letter requested the count to send police officers to guide the troops through the town as the army was retreating to the ryazn road beyond moscow this was not news to rostopchn he had known that moscow would be abandoned not merely since his interview the previous day with kutzov on the poklnny hill but ever since the battle of borodin for all the generals who came to moscow after that battle had said unanimously that it was impossible to fight another battle and since then the government property had been removed every night and half the inhabitants had left the city with rostopchns own permission yet all the same this information astonished and irritated the count coming as it did in the form of a simple note with an order from kutzov and received at night breaking in on his beauty sleep when later on in his memoirs count rostopchn explained his actions at this time he repeatedly says that he was then actuated by two important considerations to maintain tranquillity in moscow and expedite the departure of the inhabitants if one accepts this twofold aim all rostopchns actions appear irreproachable why were the holy relics the arms ammunition gunpowder and stores of corn not removed why were thousands of inhabitants deceived into believing that moscow would not be given up and thereby ruined to preserve the tranquillity of the city explains count rostopchn why were bundles of useless papers from the government offices and leppichs balloon and other articles removed to leave the town empty explains count rostopchn one need only admit that public tranquillity is in danger and any action finds a justification all the horrors of the reign of terror were based only on solicitude for public tranquillity on what then was count rostopchns fear for the tranquillity of moscow based in what reason was there for assuming any probability of an uprising in the city the inhabitants were leaving it and the retreating troops were filling it why should that cause the masses to riot neither in moscow nor anywhere in russia did anything resembling an insurrection ever occur when the enemy entered a town more than ten thousand people were still in moscow on the first and second of september and except for a mob in the governors courtyard assembled there at his bidding nothing happened it is obvious that there would have been even less reason to expect a disturbance among the people if after the battle of borodin when the surrender of moscow became certain or at least probable rostopchn instead of exciting the people by distributing arms and broadsheets had taken steps to remove all the holy relics the gunpowder munitions and money and had told the population plainly that the town would be abandoned rostopchn though he had patriotic sentiments was a sanguine and impulsive man who had always moved in the highest administrative circles and had no understanding at all of the people he supposed himself to be guiding ever since the enemys entry into smolnsk he had in imagination been playing the role of director of the popular feeling of the heart of russia not only did it seem to him as to all administrators that he controlled the external actions of moscows inhabitants but he also thought he controlled their mental attitude by means of his broadsheets and posters written in a coarse tone which the people despise in their own class and do not understand from those in authority rostopchn was so pleased with the fine role of leader of popular feeling and had grown so used to it that the necessity of relinquishing that role and abandoning moscow without any heroic display took him unawares and he suddenly felt the ground slip away from under his feet so that he positively did not know what to do though he knew it was coming he did not till the last moment wholeheartedly believe that moscow would be abandoned and did not prepare for it the inhabitants left against his wishes if the government offices were removed this was only done on the demand of officials to whom the count yielded reluctantly he was absorbed in the role he had created for himself as is often the case with those gifted with an ardent imagination though he had long known that moscow would be abandoned he knew it only with his intellect he did not believe it in his heart and did not adapt himself mentally to this new position of affairs all his painstaking and energetic
