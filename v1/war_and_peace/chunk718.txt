science does not admit the conception of the ancients as to the direct participation of the deity in human affairs and therefore history ought to give other answers modern history replying to these questions says you want to know what this movement means what caused it and what force produced these events then listen louis xiv was a very proud and self-confident man he had such and such mistresses and such and such ministers and he ruled france badly his descendants were weak men and they too ruled france badly and they had such and such favorites and such and such mistresses moreover certain men wrote some books at that time at the end of the eighteenth century there were a couple of dozen men in paris who began to talk about all men being free and equal this caused people all over france to begin to slash at and drown one another they killed the king and many other people at that time there was in france a man of genius napoleon he conquered everybody everywhere that is he killed many people because he was a great genius and for some reason he went to kill africans and killed them so well and was so cunning and wise that when he returned to france he ordered everybody to obey him and they all obeyed him having become an emperor he again went out to kill people in italy austria and prussia and there too he killed a great many in russia there was an emperor alexander who decided to restore order in europe and therefore fought against napoleon in he suddenly made friends with him but in they again quarreled and again began killing many people napoleon led six hundred thousand men into russia and captured moscow then he suddenly ran away from moscow and the emperor alexander helped by the advice of stein and others united europe to arm against the disturber of its peace all napoleons allies suddenly became his enemies and their forces advanced against the fresh forces he raised the allies defeated napoleon entered paris forced napoleon to abdicate and sent him to the island of elba not depriving him of the title of emperor and showing him every respect though five years before and one year later they all regarded him as an outlaw and a brigand then louis xviii who till then had been the laughingstock both of the french and the allies began to reign and napoleon shedding tears before his old guards renounced the throne and went into exile then the skillful statesmen and diplomatists especially talleyrand who managed to sit down in a particular chair before anyone else and thereby extended the frontiers of france talked in vienna and by these conversations made the nations happy or unhappy suddenly the diplomatists and monarchs nearly quarreled and were on the point of again ordering their armies to kill one another but just then napoleon arrived in france with a battalion and the french who had been hating him immediately all submitted to him but the allied monarchs were angry at this and went to fight the french once more and they defeated the genius napoleon and suddenly recognizing him as a brigand sent him to the island of st helena and the exile separated from the beloved france so dear to his heart died a lingering death on that rock and bequeathed his great deeds to posterity but in europe a reaction occurred and the sovereigns once again all began to oppress their subjects it would be a mistake to think that this is ironic a caricature of the historical accounts on the contrary it is a very mild expression of the contradictory replies not meeting the questions which all the historians give from the compilers of memoirs and the histories of separate states to the writers of general histories and the new histories of the culture of that period the strangeness and absurdity of these replies arise from the fact that modern history like a deaf man answers questions no one has asked if the purpose of history be to give a description of the movement of humanity and of the peoples the first question in the absence of a reply to which all the rest will be incomprehensible is what is the power that moves peoples to this modern history laboriously replies either that napoleon was a great genius or that louis xiv was very proud or that certain writers wrote certain books all that may be so and mankind is
