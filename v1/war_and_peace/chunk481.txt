battlefield having received this order the general passed by pierre on his way down the knoll to the crossing said the general coldly and sternly in reply to one of the staff who asked where he was going ill go there too i too thought pierre and followed the general the general mounted a horse a cossack had brought him pierre went to his groom who was holding his horses and asking which was the quietest clambered onto it seized it by the mane and turning out his toes pressed his heels against its sides and feeling that his spectacles were slipping off but unable to let go of the mane and reins he galloped after the general causing the staff officers to smile as they watched him from the knoll chapter xxxi having descended the hill the general after whom pierre was galloping turned sharply to the left and pierre losing sight of him galloped in among some ranks of infantry marching ahead of him he tried to pass either in front of them or to the right or left but there were soldiers everywhere all with the same preoccupied expression and busy with some unseen but evidently important task they all gazed with the same dissatisfied and inquiring expression at this stout man in a white hat who for some unknown reason threatened to trample them under his horses hoofs why ride into the middle of the battalion one of them shouted at him another prodded his horse with the butt end of a musket and pierre bending over his saddlebow and hardly able to control his shying horse galloped ahead of the soldiers where there was a free space there was a bridge ahead of him where other soldiers stood firing pierre rode up to them without being aware of it he had come to the bridge across the koloch between grki and borodin which the french having occupied borodin were attacking in the first phase of the battle pierre saw that there was a bridge in front of him and that soldiers were doing something on both sides of it and in the meadow among the rows of new-mown hay which he had taken no notice of amid the smoke of the campfires the day before but despite the incessant firing going on there he had no idea that this was the field of battle he did not notice the sound of the bullets whistling from every side or the projectiles that flew over him did not see the enemy on the other side of the river and for a long time did not notice the killed and wounded though many fell near him he looked about him with a smile which did not leave his face whys that fellow in front of the line shouted somebody at him again to the left keep to the right the men shouted to him pierre went to the right and unexpectedly encountered one of ravskis adjutants whom he knew the adjutant looked angrily at him evidently also intending to shout at him but on recognizing him he nodded how have you got here he said and galloped on pierre feeling out of place there having nothing to do and afraid of getting in someones way again galloped after the adjutant whats happening here may i come with you he asked one moment one moment replied the adjutant and riding up to a stout colonel who was standing in the meadow he gave him some message and then addressed pierre why have you come here count he asked with a smile still inquisitive yes yes assented pierre but the adjutant turned his horse about and rode on here its tolerable said he but with bagratin on the left flank theyre getting it frightfully hot really said pierre where is that come along with me to our knoll we can get a view from there and in our battery it is still bearable said the adjutant will you come yes ill come with you replied pierre looking round for his groom it was only now that he noticed wounded men staggering along or being carried on stretchers on that very meadow he had ridden over the day before a soldier was lying athwart the rows of scented hay with his head thrown awkwardly back and his shako off why havent they carried him away pierre was about to ask but seeing the stern expression of the adjutant who was also looking that way he checked himself pierre did not find his groom
