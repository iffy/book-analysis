not interest her at all she looked at him and did not think but felt about something different she felt a submissive tender love for this man who would never understand all that she understood and this seemed to make her love for him still stronger and added a touch of passionate tenderness besides this feeling which absorbed her altogether and hindered her from following the details of her husbands plans thoughts that had no connection with what he was saying flitted through her mind she thought of her nephew her husbands account of the boys agitation while pierre was speaking struck her forcibly and various traits of his gentle sensitive character recurred to her mind and while thinking of her nephew she thought also of her own children she did not compare them with him but compared her feeling for them with her feeling for him and felt with regret that there was something lacking in her feeling for young nicholas sometimes it seemed to her that this difference arose from the difference in their ages but she felt herself to blame toward him and promised in her heart to do better and to accomplish the impossible in this life to love her husband her children little nicholas and all her neighbors as christ loved mankind countess marys soul always strove toward the infinite the eternal and the absolute and could therefore never be at peace a stern expression of the lofty secret suffering of a soul burdened by the body appeared on her face nicholas gazed at her o god what will become of us if she dies as i always fear when her face is like that thought he and placing himself before the icon he began to say his evening prayers chapter xvi natsha and pierre left alone also began to talk as only a husband and wife can talk that is with extraordinary clearness and rapidity understanding and expressing each others thoughts in ways contrary to all rules of logic without premises deductions or conclusions and in a quite peculiar way natsha was so used to this kind of talk with her husband that for her it was the surest sign of something being wrong between them if pierre followed a line of logical reasoning when he began proving anything or talking argumentatively and calmly and she led on by his example began to do the same she knew that they were on the verge of a quarrel from the moment they were alone and natsha came up to him with wide-open happy eyes and quickly seizing his head pressed it to her bosom saying now you are all mine mine you wont escape from that moment this conversation began contrary to all the laws of logic and contrary to them because quite different subjects were talked about at one and the same time this simultaneous discussion of many topics did not prevent a clear understanding but on the contrary was the surest sign that they fully understood one another just as in a dream when all is uncertain unreasoning and contradictory except the feeling that guides the dream so in this intercourse contrary to all laws of reason the words themselves were not consecutive and clear but only the feeling that prompted them natsha spoke to pierre about her brothers life and doings of how she had suffered and lacked life during his own absence and of how she was fonder than ever of mary and how mary was in every way better than herself in saying this natsha was sincere in acknowledging marys superiority but at the same time by saying it she made a demand on pierre that he should all the same prefer her to mary and to all other women and that now especially after having seen many women in petersburg he should tell her so afresh pierre answering natshas words told her how intolerable it had been for him to meet ladies at dinners and balls in petersburg i have quite lost the knack of talking to ladies he said it was simply dull besides i was very busy natsha looked intently at him and went on mary is so splendid she said how she understands children it is as if she saw straight into their souls yesterday for instance mtya was naughty how like his father he is pierre interjected natsha knew why he mentioned mtyas likeness to nicholas the recollection of his dispute with his brother-in-law was unpleasant and he wanted to know what natsha thought of it nicholas
