who commanded more would evidently work less with his hands on account of his greater verbal activity when some larger concourse of men direct their activity to a common aim there is a yet sharper division of those who because their activity is given to directing and commanding take less part in the direct work when a man works alone he always has a certain set of reflections which as it seems to him directed his past activity justify his present activity and guide him in planning his future actions just the same is done by a concourse of people allowing those who do not take a direct part in the activity to devise considerations justifications and surmises concerning their collective activity for reasons known or unknown to us the french began to drown and kill one another and corresponding to the event its justification appears in peoples belief that this was necessary for the welfare of france for liberty and for equality people ceased to kill one another and this event was accompanied by its justification in the necessity for a centralization of power resistance to europe and so on men went from the west to the east killing their fellow men and the event was accompanied by phrases about the glory of france the baseness of england and so on history shows us that these justifications of the events have no common sense and are all contradictory as in the case of killing a man as the result of recognizing his rights and the killing of millions in russia for the humiliation of england but these justifications have a very necessary significance in their own day these justifications release those who produce the events from moral responsibility these temporary aims are like the broom fixed in front of a locomotive to clear the snow from the rails in front they clear mens moral responsibilities from their path without such justification there would be no reply to the simplest question that presents itself when examining each historical event how is it that millions of men commit collective crimes make war commit murder and so on with the present complex forms of political and social life in europe can any event that is not prescribed decreed or ordered by monarchs ministers parliaments or newspapers be imagined is there any collective action which cannot find its justification in political unity in patriotism in the balance of power or in civilization so that every event that occurs inevitably coincides with some expressed wish and receiving a justification presents itself as the result of the will of one man or of several men in whatever direction a ship moves the flow of the waves it cuts will always be noticeable ahead of it to those on board the ship the movement of those waves will be the only perceptible motion only by watching closely moment by moment the movement of that flow and comparing it with the movement of the ship do we convince ourselves that every bit of it is occasioned by the forward movement of the ship and that we were led into error by the fact that we ourselves were imperceptibly moving we see the same if we watch moment by moment the movement of historical characters that is re-establish the inevitable condition of all that occurs the continuity of movement in time and do not lose sight of the essential connection of historical persons with the masses when the ship moves in one direction there is one and the same wave ahead of it when it turns frequently the wave ahead of it also turns frequently but wherever it may turn there always will be the wave anticipating its movement whatever happens it always appears that just that event was foreseen and decreed wherever the ship may go the rush of water which neither directs nor increases its movement foams ahead of it and at a distance seems to us not merely to move of itself but to govern the ships movement also examining only those expressions of the will of historical persons which as commands were related to events historians have assumed that the events depended on those commands but examining the events themselves and the connection in which the historical persons stood to the people we have found that they and their orders were dependent on events the incontestable proof of this deduction is that however many commands were issued the event does not take place unless there are other causes for it but as soon as an event
