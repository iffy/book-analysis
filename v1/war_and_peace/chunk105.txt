a pleasant humming and whistling of bullets were often heard what is this thought prince andrew approaching the crowd of soldiers it cant be an attack for they are not moving it cant be a square for they are not drawn up for that the commander of the regiment a thin feeble-looking old man with a pleasant smile his eyelids drooping more than half over his old eyes giving him a mild expression rode up to bagratin and welcomed him as a host welcomes an honored guest he reported that his regiment had been attacked by french cavalry and that though the attack had been repulsed he had lost more than half his men he said the attack had been repulsed employing this military term to describe what had occurred to his regiment but in reality he did not himself know what had happened during that half-hour to the troops entrusted to him and could not say with certainty whether the attack had been repulsed or his regiment had been broken up all he knew was that at the commencement of the action balls and shells began flying all over his regiment and hitting men and that afterwards someone had shouted cavalry and our men had begun firing they were still firing not at the cavalry which had disappeared but at french infantry who had come into the hollow and were firing at our men prince bagratin bowed his head as a sign that this was exactly what he had desired and expected turning to his adjutant he ordered him to bring down the two battalions of the sixth chasseurs whom they had just passed prince andrew was struck by the changed expression on prince bagratins face at this moment it expressed the concentrated and happy resolution you see on the face of a man who on a hot day takes a final run before plunging into the water the dull sleepy expression was no longer there nor the affectation of profound thought the round steady hawks eyes looked before him eagerly and rather disdainfully not resting on anything although his movements were still slow and measured the commander of the regiment turned to prince bagratin entreating him to go back as it was too dangerous to remain where they were please your excellency for gods sake he kept saying glancing for support at an officer of the suite who turned away from him there you see and he drew attention to the bullets whistling singing and hissing continually around them he spoke in the tone of entreaty and reproach that a carpenter uses to a gentleman who has picked up an ax we are used to it but you sir will blister your hands he spoke as if those bullets could not kill him and his half-closed eyes gave still more persuasiveness to his words the staff officer joined in the colonels appeals but bagratin did not reply he only gave an order to cease firing and re-form so as to give room for the two approaching battalions while he was speaking the curtain of smoke that had concealed the hollow driven by a rising wind began to move from right to left as if drawn by an invisible hand and the hill opposite with the french moving about on it opened out before them all eyes fastened involuntarily on this french column advancing against them and winding down over the uneven ground one could already see the soldiers shaggy caps distinguish the officers from the men and see the standard flapping against its staff they march splendidly remarked someone in bagratins suite the head of the column had already descended into the hollow the clash would take place on this side of it the remains of our regiment which had been in action rapidly formed up and moved to the right from behind it dispersing the laggards came two battalions of the sixth chasseurs in fine order before they had reached bagratin the weighty tread of the mass of men marching in step could be heard on their left flank nearest to bagratin marched a company commander a fine round-faced man with a stupid and happy expression the same man who had rushed out of the wattle shed at that moment he was clearly thinking of nothing but how dashing a fellow he would appear as he passed the commander with the self-satisfaction of a man on parade he stepped lightly with his muscular legs as if sailing along stretching himself to his full height without the smallest effort his
