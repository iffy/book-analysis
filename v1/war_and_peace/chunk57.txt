had come up to him princess mary looked at her brother in surprise she did not understand what he was laughing at everything her father did inspired her with reverence and was beyond question everyone has his achilles heel continued prince andrew fancy with his powerful mind indulging in such nonsense princess mary could not understand the boldness of her brothers criticism and was about to reply when the expected footsteps were heard coming from the study the prince walked in quickly and jauntily as was his wont as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of his manners with the strict formality of his house at that moment the great clock struck two and another with a shrill tone joined in from the drawing room the prince stood still his lively glittering eyes from under their thick bushy eyebrows sternly scanned all present and rested on the little princess she felt as courtiers do when the tsar enters the sensation of fear and respect which the old man inspired in all around him he stroked her hair and then patted her awkwardly on the back of her neck im glad glad to see you he said looking attentively into her eyes and then quickly went to his place and sat down sit down sit down sit down michael ivnovich he indicated a place beside him to his daughter-in-law a footman moved the chair for her ho ho said the old man casting his eyes on her rounded figure youve been in a hurry thats bad he laughed in his usual dry cold unpleasant way with his lips only and not with his eyes you must walk walk as much as possible as much as possible he said the little princess did not or did not wish to hear his words she was silent and seemed confused the prince asked her about her father and she began to smile and talk he asked about mutual acquaintances and she became still more animated and chattered away giving him greetings from various people and retelling the town gossip countess aprksina poor thing has lost her husband and she has cried her eyes out she said growing more and more lively as she became animated the prince looked at her more and more sternly and suddenly as if he had studied her sufficiently and had formed a definite idea of her he turned away and addressed michael ivnovich well michael ivnovich our bonaparte will be having a bad time of it prince andrew he always spoke thus of his son has been telling me what forces are being collected against him while you and i never thought much of him michael ivnovich did not at all know when you and i had said such things about bonaparte but understanding that he was wanted as a peg on which to hang the princes favorite topic he looked inquiringly at the young prince wondering what would follow he is a great tactician said the prince to his son pointing to the architect and the conversation again turned on the war on bonaparte and the generals and statesmen of the day the old prince seemed convinced not only that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know the a b c of war or of politics and that bonaparte was an insignificant little frenchy successful only because there were no longer any potmkins or suvrovs left to oppose him but he was also convinced that there were no political difficulties in europe and no real war but only a sort of puppet show at which the men of the day were playing pretending to do something real prince andrew gaily bore with his fathers ridicule of the new men and drew him on and listened to him with evident pleasure the past always seems good said he but did not suvrov himself fall into a trap moreau set him and from which he did not know how to escape who told you that who cried the prince suvrov and he jerked away his plate which tkhon briskly caught suvrov consider prince andrew two frederick and suvrov moreau moreau would have been a prisoner if suvrov had had a free hand but he had the hofs-kriegs-wurst-schnapps-rath on his hands it would have puzzled the devil himself when you get there youll find out what those hofs-kriegs-wurst-raths are suvrov couldnt manage them so what chance has michael kutzov no my dear boy he continued you and your generals wont get on against buonaparte youll have to call in
