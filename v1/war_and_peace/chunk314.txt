here she is said the old count when he saw natsha enter well sit down by me but natsha stayed by her mother and glanced round as if looking for something mamma she muttered give him to me give him mamma quickly quickly and she again had difficulty in repressing her sobs she sat down at the table and listened to the conversation between the elders and nicholas who had also come to the table my god my god the same faces the same talk papa holding his cup and blowing in the same way thought natsha feeling with horror a sense of repulsion rising up in her for the whole household because they were always the same after tea nicholas snya and natsha went to the sitting room to their favorite corner where their most intimate talks always began chapter x does it ever happen to you said natsha to her brother when they settled down in the sitting room does it ever happen to you to feel as if there were nothing more to come nothing that everything good is past and to feel not exactly dull but sad i should think so he replied i have felt like that when everything was all right and everyone was cheerful the thought has come into my mind that i was already tired of it all and that we must all die once in the regiment i had not gone to some merrymaking where there was music and suddenly i felt so depressed oh yes i know i know i know natsha interrupted him when i was quite little that used to be so with me do you remember when i was punished once about some plums you were all dancing and i sat sobbing in the schoolroom i shall never forget it i felt sad and sorry for everyone for myself and for everyone and i was innocent that was the chief thing said natsha do you remember i remember answered nicholas i remember that i came to you afterwards and wanted to comfort you but do you know i felt ashamed to we were terribly absurd i had a funny doll then and wanted to give it to you do you remember and do you remember natsha asked with a pensive smile how once long long ago when we were quite little uncle called us into the study that was in the old house and it was dark we went in and suddenly there stood a negro chimed in nicholas with a smile of delight of course i remember even now i dont know whether there really was a negro or if we only dreamed it or were told about him he was gray you remember and had white teeth and stood and looked at us snya do you remember asked nicholas yes yes i do remember something too snya answered timidly you know i have asked papa and mamma about that negro said natsha and they say there was no negro at all but you see you remember of course i do i remember his teeth as if i had just seen them how strange it is its as if it were a dream i like that and do you remember how we rolled hard-boiled eggs in the ballroom and suddenly two old women began spinning round on the carpet was that real or not do you remember what fun it was yes and you remember how papa in his blue overcoat fired a gun in the porch so they went through their memories smiling with pleasure not the sad memories of old age but poetic youthful ones those impressions of ones most distant past in which dreams and realities blend and they laughed with quiet enjoyment snya as always did not quite keep pace with them though they shared the same reminiscences much that they remembered had slipped from her mind and what she recalled did not arouse the same poetic feeling as they experienced she simply enjoyed their pleasure and tried to fit in with it she only really took part when they recalled snyas first arrival she told them how afraid she had been of nicholas because he had on a corded jacket and her nurse had told her that she too would be sewn up with cords and i remember their telling me that you had been born under a cabbage said natsha and i remember that i dared not disbelieve it then but knew that it was not true and i felt so uncomfortable
