balls and bullets were just what he needed in his angry mood one of the first bullets killed him and other bullets killed many of his men and his division remained under fire for some time quite uselessly chapter vii meanwhile another column was to have attacked the french from the front but kutzov accompanied that column he well knew that nothing but confusion would come of this battle undertaken against his will and as far as was in his power held the troops back he did not advance he rode silently on his small gray horse indolently answering suggestions that they should attack the word attack is always on your tongue but you dont see that we are unable to execute complicated maneuvers said he to milordovich who asked permission to advance we couldnt take murat prisoner this morning or get to the place in time and nothing can be done now he replied to someone else when kutzov was informed that at the french rear where according to the reports of the cossacks there had previously been nobody there were now two battalions of poles he gave a sidelong glance at ermlov who was behind him and to whom he had not spoken since the previous day you see they are asking to attack and making plans of all kinds but as soon as one gets to business nothing is ready and the enemy forewarned takes measures accordingly ermlov screwed up his eyes and smiled faintly on hearing these words he understood that for him the storm had blown over and that kutzov would content himself with that hint hes having a little fun at my expense said ermlov softly nudging with his knee ravski who was at his side soon after this ermlov moved up to kutzov and respectfully remarked it is not too late yet your highness the enemy has not gone away if you were to order an attack if not the guards will not so much as see a little smoke kutzov did not reply but when they reported to him that murats troops were in retreat he ordered an advance though at every hundred paces he halted for three quarters of an hour the whole battle consisted in what orlv-densovs cossacks had done the rest of the army merely lost some hundreds of men uselessly in consequence of this battle kutzov received a diamond decoration and bennigsen some diamonds and a hundred thousand rubles others also received pleasant recognitions corresponding to their various grades and following the battle fresh changes were made in the staff thats how everything is done with us all topsy-turvy said the russian officers and generals after the tartino battle letting it be understood that some fool there is doing things all wrong but that we ourselves should not have done so just as people speak today but people who talk like that either do not know what they are talking about or deliberately deceive themselves no battle tartino borodin or austerlitz takes place as those who planned it anticipated that is an essential condition a countless number of free forces for nowhere is man freer than during a battle where it is a question of life and death influence the course taken by the fight and that course never can be known in advance and never coincides with the direction of any one force if many simultaneously and variously directed forces act on a given body the direction of its motion cannot coincide with any one of those forces but will always be a mean what in mechanics is represented by the diagonal of a parallelogram of forces if in the descriptions given by historians especially french ones we find their wars and battles carried out in accordance with previously formed plans the only conclusion to be drawn is that those descriptions are false the battle of tartino obviously did not attain the aim toll had in view to lead the troops into action in the order prescribed by the dispositions nor that which count orlv-densov may have had in view to take murat prisoner nor the result of immediately destroying the whole corps which bennigsen and others may have had in view nor the aim of the officer who wished to go into action to distinguish himself nor that of the cossack who wanted more booty than he got and so on but if the aim of the battle was what actually resulted and what all the russians of that day desired to drive the french out of russia
