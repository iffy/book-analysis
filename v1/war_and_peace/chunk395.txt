following him rostv himself did not know how or why he did it he acted as he did when hunting without reflecting or considering he saw the dragoons near and that they were galloping in disorder he knew they could not withstand an attack knew there was only that moment and that if he let it slip it would not return the bullets were whining and whistling so stimulatingly around him and his horse was so eager to go that he could not restrain himself he touched his horse gave the word of command and immediately hearing behind him the tramp of the horses of his deployed squadron rode at full trot downhill toward the dragoons hardly had they reached the bottom of the hill before their pace instinctively changed to a gallop which grew faster and faster as they drew nearer to our uhlans and the french dragoons who galloped after them the dragoons were now close at hand on seeing the hussars the foremost began to turn while those behind began to halt with the same feeling with which he had galloped across the path of a wolf rostv gave rein to his donts horse and galloped to intersect the path of the dragoons disordered lines one uhlan stopped another who was on foot flung himself to the ground to avoid being knocked over and a riderless horse fell in among the hussars nearly all the french dragoons were galloping back rostv picking out one on a gray horse dashed after him on the way he came upon a bush his gallant horse cleared it and almost before he had righted himself in his saddle he saw that he would immediately overtake the enemy he had selected that frenchman by his uniform an officer was going at a gallop crouching on his gray horse and urging it on with his saber in another moment rostvs horse dashed its breast against the hindquarters of the officers horse almost knocking it over and at the same instant rostv without knowing why raised his saber and struck the frenchman with it the instant he had done this all rostvs animation vanished the officer fell not so much from the blow which had but slightly cut his arm above the elbow as from the shock to his horse and from fright rostv reined in his horse and his eyes sought his foe to see whom he had vanquished the french dragoon officer was hopping with one foot on the ground the other being caught in the stirrup his eyes screwed up with fear as if he every moment expected another blow gazed up at rostv with shrinking terror his pale and mud-stained face fair and young with a dimple in the chin and light-blue eyes was not an enemys face at all suited to a battlefield but a most ordinary homelike face before rostv had decided what to do with him the officer cried i surrender he hurriedly but vainly tried to get his foot out of the stirrup and did not remove his frightened blue eyes from rostvs face some hussars who galloped up disengaged his foot and helped him into the saddle on all sides the hussars were busy with the dragoons one was wounded but though his face was bleeding he would not give up his horse another was perched up behind an hussar with his arms round him a third was being helped by an hussar to mount his horse in front the french infantry were firing as they ran the hussars galloped hastily back with their prisoners rostv galloped back with the rest aware of an unpleasant feeling of depression in his heart something vague and confused which he could not at all account for had come over him with the capture of that officer and the blow he had dealt him count ostermann-tolsty met the returning hussars sent for rostv thanked him and said he would report his gallant deed to the emperor and would recommend him for a st georges cross when sent for by count ostermann rostv remembering that he had charged without orders felt sure his commander was sending for him to punish him for breach of discipline ostermanns flattering words and promise of a reward should therefore have struck him all the more pleasantly but he still felt that same vaguely disagreeable feeling of moral nausea but what on earth is worrying me he asked himself as he rode back from the general ilyn no hes safe have i disgraced myself in any way
