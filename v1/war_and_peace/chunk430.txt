continued forgetting for a moment that though at hlnes one had to ridicule the moscow enthusiasm at anna pvlovnas one had to be ecstatic about it but he retrieved his mistake at once now is it suitable that count kutzov the oldest general in russia should preside at that tribunal he will get nothing for his pains how could they make a man commander in chief who cannot mount a horse who drops asleep at a council and has the very worst morals a good reputation he made for himself at bucharest i dont speak of his capacity as a general but at a time like this how they appoint a decrepit blind old man positively blind a fine idea to have a blind general he cant see anything to play blindmans bulff he cant see at all no one replied to his remarks this was quite correct on the twenty-fourth of july but on the twenty-ninth of july kutzov received the title of prince this might indicate a wish to get rid of him and therefore prince vaslis opinion continued to be correct though he was not now in any hurry to express it but on the eighth of august a committee consisting of field marshal saltykv arakchev vyazmtinov lopukhn and kochuby met to consider the progress of the war this committee came to the conclusion that our failures were due to a want of unity in the command and though the members of the committee were aware of the emperors dislike of kutzov after a short deliberation they agreed to advise his appointment as commander in chief that same day kutzov was appointed commander in chief with full powers over the armies and over the whole region occupied by them on the ninth of august prince vasli at anna pvlovnas again met the man of great merit the latter was very attentive to anna pvlovna because he wanted to be appointed director of one of the educational establishments for young ladies prince vasli entered the room with the air of a happy conqueror who has attained the object of his desires well have you heard the great news prince kutzov is field marshal all dissensions are at an end i am so glad so delighted at last we have a man said he glancing sternly and significantly round at everyone in the drawing room the man of great merit despite his desire to obtain the post of director could not refrain from reminding prince vasli of his former opinion though this was impolite to prince vasli in anna pvlovnas drawing room and also to anna pvlovna herself who had received the news with delight he could not resist the temptation but prince they say he is blind said he reminding prince vasli of his own words eh nonsense he sees well enough said prince vasli rapidly in a deep voice and with a slight cough the voice and cough with which he was wont to dispose of all difficulties he sees well enough he added and what i am so pleased about he went on is that our sovereign has given him full powers over all the armies and the whole region powers no commander in chief ever had before he is a second autocrat he concluded with a victorious smile god grant it god grant it said anna pvlovna the man of great merit who was still a novice in court circles wishing to flatter anna pvlovna by defending her former position on this question observed it is said that the emperor was reluctant to give kutzov those powers they say he blushed like a girl to whom joconde is read when he said to kutzov your emperor and the fatherland award you this honor perhaps the heart took no part in that speech said anna pvlovna oh no no warmly rejoined prince vasli who would not now yield kutzov to anyone in his opinion kutzov was not only admirable himself but was adored by everybody no thats impossible said he for our sovereign appreciated him so highly before god grant only that prince kutzov assumes real power and does not allow anyone to put a spoke in his wheel observed anna pvlovna understanding at once to whom she alluded prince vasli said in a whisper i know for a fact that kutzov made it an absolute condition that the tsarvich should not be with the army do you know what he said to the emperor and prince vasli repeated the words supposed to have been spoken by kutzov
