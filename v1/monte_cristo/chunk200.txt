him aloof from all friendships teresa alone ruled by a look a word a gesture this impetuous character which yielded beneath the hand of a woman and which beneath the hand of a man might have broken but could never have been bended teresa was lively and gay but coquettish to excess the two piastres that luigi received every month from the count of san-felices steward and the price of all the little carvings in wood he sold at rome were expended in ear-rings necklaces and gold hairpins so that thanks to her friends generosity teresa was the most beautiful and the best-attired peasant near rome the two children grew up together passing all their time with each other and giving themselves up to the wild ideas of their different characters thus in all their dreams their wishes and their conversations vampa saw himself the captain of a vessel general of an army or governor of a province teresa saw herself rich superbly attired and attended by a train of liveried domestics then when they had thus passed the day in building castles in the air they separated their flocks and descended from the elevation of their dreams to the reality of their humble position one day the young shepherd told the counts steward that he had seen a wolf come out of the sabine mountains and prowl around his flock the steward gave him a gun this was what vampa longed for this gun had an excellent barrel made at brescia and carrying a ball with the precision of an english rifle but one day the count broke the stock and had then cast the gun aside this however was nothing to a sculptor like vampa he examined the broken stock calculated what change it would require to adapt the gun to his shoulder and made a fresh stock so beautifully carved that it would have fetched fifteen or twenty piastres had he chosen to sell it but nothing could be farther from his thoughts for a long time a gun had been the young mans greatest ambition in every country where independence has taken the place of liberty the first desire of a manly heart is to possess a weapon which at once renders him capable of defence or attack and by rendering its owner terrible often makes him feared from this moment vampa devoted all his leisure time to perfecting himself in the use of his precious weapon he purchased powder and ball and everything served him for a mark the trunk of some old and moss-grown olive-tree that grew on the sabine mountains the fox as he quitted his earth on some marauding excursion the eagle that soared above their heads and thus he soon became so expert that teresa overcame the terror she at first felt at the report and amused herself by watching him direct the ball wherever he pleased with as much accuracy as if he placed it by hand m one evening a wolf emerged from a pine-wood near which they were usually stationed but the wolf had scarcely advanced ten yards ere he was dead proud of this exploit vampa took the dead animal on his shoulders and carried him to the farm these exploits had gained luigi considerable reputation the man of superior abilities always finds admirers go where he will he was spoken of as the most adroit the strongest and the most courageous contadino for ten leagues around and although teresa was universally allowed to be the most beautiful girl of the sabines no one had ever spoken to her of love because it was known that she was beloved by vampa and yet the two young people had never declared their affection
