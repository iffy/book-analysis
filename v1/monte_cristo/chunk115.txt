of them a little farther a little farther said the other you know very well that the last was stopped on his way dashed on the rocks and the governor told us next day that we were careless fellows they ascended five or six more steps and then dants felt that they took him one by the head and the other by the heels and swung him to and fro one said the grave-diggers two three and at the same instant dants felt himself flung into the air like a wounded bird falling falling with a rapidity that made his blood curdle although drawn downwards by the heavy weight which hastened his rapid descent it seemed to him as if the fall lasted for a century at last with a horrible splash he darted like an arrow into the ice-cold water and as he did so he uttered a shrill cry stifled in a moment by his immersion beneath the waves dants had been flung into the sea and was dragged into its depths by a thirty-six-pound shot tied to his feet the sea is the cemetery of the chteau dif m chapter the island of tiboulen dants although stunned and almost suffocated had sufficient presence of mind to hold his breath and as his right hand prepared as he was for every chance held his knife open he rapidly ripped up the sack extricated his arm and then his body but in spite of all his efforts to free himself from the shot he felt it dragging him down still lower he then bent his body and by a desperate effort severed the cord that bound his legs at the moment when it seemed as if he were actually strangled with a mighty leap he rose to the surface of the sea while the shot dragged down to the depths the sack that had so nearly become his shroud dants waited only to get breath and then dived in order to avoid being seen when he arose a second time he was fifty paces from where he had first sunk he saw overhead a black and tempestuous sky across which the wind was driving clouds that occasionally suffered a twinkling star to appear before him was the vast expanse of waters sombre and terrible whose waves foamed and roared as if before the approach of a storm behind him blacker than the sea blacker than the sky rose phantom-like the vast stone structure whose projecting crags seemed like arms extended to seize their prey and on the highest rock was a torch lighting two figures he fancied that these two forms were looking at the sea doubtless these strange grave-diggers had heard his cry dants dived again and remained a long time beneath the water this was an easy feat to him for he usually attracted a crowd of spectators in the bay before the lighthouse at marseilles when he swam there and was unanimously declared to be the best swimmer in the port when he came up again the light had disappeared he must now get his bearings ratonneau and pomgue are the nearest islands of all those that surround the chteau dif but ratonneau and pomgue are inhabited as is also the islet of daume tiboulen and lemaire were therefore the safest for dants venture the islands of tiboulen and lemaire are a league from the chteau dif dants nevertheless determined to make for them but how could he find his way in the darkness of the night at this moment he saw the light of planier gleaming in front of him like a star by leaving this light on the right he kept the island of tiboulen a little on the
