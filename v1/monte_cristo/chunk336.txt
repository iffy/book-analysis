this in time observed monte cristo you know that human inventions march from the complex to the simple and simplicity is always perfection in the meanwhile continued the magistrate our codes are in full force with all their contradictory enactments derived from gallic customs roman laws and frank usages the knowledge of all which you will agree is not to be acquired without extended labor it needs tedious study to acquire this knowledge and when acquired a strong power of brain to retain it i agree with you entirely sir but all that even you know with respect to the french code i know not only in reference to that code but as regards the codes of all nations the english turkish japanese hindu laws are as familiar to me as the french laws and thus i was right when i said to you that relatively you know that everything is relative sir that relatively to what i have done you have very little to do but that relatively to all i have learned you have yet a great deal to learn but with what motive have you learned all this inquired villefort in astonishment monte cristo smiled really sir he observed i see that in spite of the reputation which you have acquired as a superior man you look at everything from the material and vulgar view of society beginning with man and ending with man that is to say in the most restricted most narrow view which it is possible for human understanding to embrace pray sir explain yourself said villefort more and more astonished i really do not understand you perfectly i say sir that with the eyes fixed on the social organization of nations you see only the springs of the machine and lose sight of the sublime workman who makes them act i say that you do not recognize before you and around you any but those office-holders whose commissions have been signed by a minister or king and that the men whom god has put above those office-holders ministers and kings by giving them a mission to follow out instead of a post to fill i say that they escape your narrow limited field of observation it is thus that human weakness fails from its debilitated and imperfect organs tobias took the angel who restored him to light for an ordinary young man the nations took attila who was doomed to destroy them for a conqueror similar to other conquerors and it was necessary for both to reveal their missions that they might be known and acknowledged one was compelled to say i am the angel of the lord and the other i am the hammer of god in order that the divine essence in both might be revealed then said villefort more and more amazed and really supposing he was speaking to a mystic or a madman you consider yourself as one of those extraordinary beings whom you have mentioned and why not said monte cristo coldly your pardon sir replied villefort quite astounded but you will excuse me if when i presented myself to you i was unaware that i should meet with a person whose knowledge and understanding so far surpass the usual knowledge and understanding of men it is not usual with us corrupted wretches of civilization to find gentlemen like yourself possessors as you are of immense fortune at least so it is said and i beg you to observe that i do not inquire i merely repeat it is not usual i say for such privileged and wealthy beings to waste their time in speculations on the state of society in philosophical reveries intended at best to console those whom fate has disinherited
