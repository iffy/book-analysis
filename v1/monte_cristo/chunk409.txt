sir by the help of two signs with which i will acquaint you presently you may ascertain with perfect certainty that my grandfather is still in the full possession of all his mental faculties m noirtier being deprived of voice and motion is accustomed to convey his meaning by closing his eyes when he wishes to signify yes and to wink when he means no you now know quite enough to enable you to converse with m noirtier try noirtier gave valentine such a look of tenderness and gratitude that it was comprehended even by the notary himself you have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been saying sir have you asked the notary noirtier closed his eyes and you approve of what she said that is to say you declare that the signs which she mentioned are really those by means of which you are accustomed to convey your thoughts yes it was you who sent for me yes to make your will yes and you do not wish me to go away without fulfilling your original intentions the old man winked violently well sir said the young girl do you understand now and is your conscience perfectly at rest on the subject but before the notary could answer villefort had drawn him aside sir said he do you suppose for a moment that a man can sustain a physical shock such as m noirtier has received without any detriment to his mental faculties it is not exactly that sir said the notary which makes me uneasy but the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and intentions so as to be able to get his answers you must see that to be an utter impossibility said villefort valentine and the old man heard this conversation and noirtier fixed his eye so earnestly on valentine that she felt bound to answer to the look sir said she that need not make you uneasy however difficult it may at first sight appear to be i can discover and explain to you my grandfathers thoughts so as to put an end to all your doubts and fears on the subject i have now been six years with m noirtier and let him tell you if ever once during that time he has entertained a thought which he was unable to make me understand no signed the old man let us try what we can do then said the notary you accept this young lady as your interpreter m noirtier yes well sir what do you require of me and what document is it that you wish to be drawn up valentine named all the letters of the alphabet until she came to w at this letter the eloquent eye of noirtier gave her notice that she was to stop it is very evident that it is the letter w which m noirtier wants said the notary wait said valentine and turning to her grandfather she repeated wa we wi the old man stopped her at the last syllable valentine then took the dictionary and the notary watched her while she turned over the pages she passed her finger slowly down the columns and when she came to the word will m noirtiers eye bade her stop will said the notary it is very evident that m noirtier is desirous of making his will yes yes yes motioned the invalid really sir you must allow that this is most extraordinary said the astonished notary turning to m de villefort yes said the procureur and i think the will promises to be yet more extraordinary for i cannot see how it is to be drawn up without the intervention of valentine and she may perhaps be considered
