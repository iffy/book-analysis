greatest protectors of commerce and sincere devotees to their principles in one of the mourning-coaches beauchamp debray and chteau-renaud were talking of the very sudden death of the marchioness i saw madame de saint-mran only last year at marseilles when i was coming back from algiers said chteau-renaud she looked like a woman destined to live to be a hundred years old from her apparent sound health and great activity of mind and body how old was she franz assured me replied albert that she was sixty-six years old but she has not died of old age but of grief it appears that since the death of the marquis which affected her very deeply she has not completely recovered her reason but of what disease then did she die asked debray it is said to have been a congestion of the brain or apoplexy which is the same thing is it not nearly it is difficult to believe that it was apoplexy said beauchamp madame de saint-mran whom i once saw was short of slender form and of a much more nervous than sanguine temperament grief could hardly produce apoplexy in such a constitution as that of madame de saint-mran at any rate said albert whatever disease or doctor may have killed her m de villefort or rather mademoiselle valentine or still rather our friend franz inherits a magnificent fortune amounting i believe to livres per annum and this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old jacobin noirtier that is a tenacious old grandfather said beauchamp tenacem propositi virum i think he must have made an agreement with death to outlive all his heirs and he appears likely to succeed he resembles the old conventionalist of who said to napoleon in you bend because your empire is a young stem weakened by rapid growth take the republic for a tutor let us return with renewed strength to the battle-field and i promise you soldiers another marengo and a second austerlitz ideas do not become extinct sire they slumber sometimes but only revive the stronger before they sleep entirely ideas and men appeared the same to him said albert one thing only puzzles me namely how franz dpinay will like a grandfather who cannot be separated from his wife but where is franz in the first carriage with m de villefort who considers him already as one of the family m such was the conversation in almost all the carriages these two sudden deaths so quickly following each other astonished everyone but no one suspected the terrible secret which m davrigny had communicated in his nocturnal walk to m de villefort they arrived in about an hour at the cemetery the weather was mild but dull and in harmony with the funeral ceremony among the groups which flocked towards the family vault chteau-renaud recognized morrel who had come alone in a cabriolet and walked silently along the path bordered with yew-trees you here said chteau-renaud passing his arms through the young captains are you a friend of villeforts how is it that i have never met you at his house i am no acquaintance of m de villeforts answered morrel but i was of madame de saint-mran albert came up to them at this moment with franz the time and place are but ill-suited for an introduction said albert but we are not superstitious m morrel allow me to present to you m franz dpinay a delightful travelling companion with whom i made the tour of italy my dear franz m maximilian morrel an excellent friend i have acquired in your absence and whose name you will hear me mention every time i make any allusion to affection wit or amiability morrel hesitated
