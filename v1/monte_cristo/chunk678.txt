in that room mercds was much changed within the last few days not that even in her days of fortune she had ever dressed with the magnificent display which makes us no longer able to recognize a woman when she appears in a plain and simple attire nor indeed had she fallen into that state of depression where it is impossible to conceal the garb of misery no the change in mercds was that her eye no longer sparkled her lips no longer smiled and there was now a hesitation in uttering the words which formerly sprang so fluently from her ready wit it was not poverty which had broken her spirit it was not a want of courage which rendered her poverty burdensome mercds although deposed from the exalted position she had occupied lost in the sphere she had now chosen like a person passing from a room splendidly lighted into utter darkness appeared like a queen fallen from her palace to a hovel and who reduced to strict necessity could neither become reconciled to the earthen vessels she was herself forced to place upon the table nor to the humble pallet which had become her bed the beautiful catalane and noble countess had lost both her proud glance and charming smile because she saw nothing but misery around her the walls were hung with one of the gray papers which economical landlords choose as not likely to show the dirt the floor was uncarpeted the furniture attracted the attention to the poor attempt at luxury indeed everything offended eyes accustomed to refinement and elegance madame de morcerf had lived there since leaving her house the continual silence of the spot oppressed her still seeing that albert continually watched her countenance to judge the state of her feelings she constrained herself to assume a monotonous smile of the lips alone which contrasted with the sweet and beaming expression that usually shone from her eyes seemed like moonlight on a statue yielding light without warmth albert too was ill at ease the remains of luxury prevented him from sinking into his actual position if he wished to go out without gloves his hands appeared too white if he wished to walk through the town his boots seemed too highly polished yet these two noble and intelligent creatures united by the indissoluble ties of maternal and filial love had succeeded in tacitly understanding one another and economizing their stores and albert had been able to tell his mother without extorting a change of countenance mother we have no more money m mercds had never known misery she had often in her youth spoken of poverty but between want and necessity those synonymous words there is a wide difference amongst the catalans mercds wished for a thousand things but still she never really wanted any so long as the nets were good they caught fish and so long as they sold their fish they were able to buy twine for new nets and then shut out from friendship having but one affection which could not be mixed up with her ordinary pursuits she thought of herself of no one but herself upon the little she earned she lived as well as she could now there were two to be supported and nothing to live upon winter approached mercds had no fire in that cold and naked room she who was accustomed to stoves which heated the house from the hall to the boudoir she had not even one little flower she whose apartment had been a conservatory of costly exotics but she had her son hitherto the excitement of fulfilling a duty had sustained them excitement like enthusiasm sometimes renders us unconscious to the things of
