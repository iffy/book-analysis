his presence he meets albert de morcerf in italy it is to rescue him from the hands of the banditti he introduces himself to madame danglars it is that he may give her a royal present your step-mother and her son pass before his door it is that his nubian may save them from destruction this man evidently possesses the power of influencing events both as regards men and things i never saw more simple tastes united to greater magnificence his smile is so sweet when he addresses me that i forget it ever can be bitter to others ah valentine tell me if he ever looked on you with one of those sweet smiles if so depend on it you will be happy me said the young girl he never even glances at me on the contrary if i accidentally cross his path he appears rather to avoid me ah he is not generous neither does he possess that supernatural penetration which you attribute to him for if he did he would have perceived that i was unhappy and if he had been generous seeing me sad and solitary he would have used his influence to my advantage and since as you say he resembles the sun he would have warmed my heart with one of his life-giving rays you say he loves you maximilian how do you know that he does all would pay deference to an officer like you with a fierce moustache and a long sabre but they think they may crush a poor weeping girl with impunity ah valentine i assure you you are mistaken if it were otherwise if he treated me diplomatically that is to say like a man who wishes by some means or other to obtain a footing in the house so that he may ultimately gain the power of dictating to its occupants he would if it had been but once have honored me with the smile which you extol so loudly but no he saw that i was unhappy he understood that i could be of no use to him and therefore paid no attention to me whatever who knows but that in order to please madame de villefort and my father he may not persecute me by every means in his power it is not just that he should despise me so without any reason ah forgive me said valentine perceiving the effect which her words were producing on maximilian i have done wrong for i have given utterance to thoughts concerning that man which i did not even know existed in my heart i do not deny the influence of which you speak or that i have not myself experienced it but with me it has been productive of evil rather than good well valentine said morrel with a sigh we will not discuss the matter further i will not make a confidant of him alas said valentine i see that i have given you pain i can only say how sincerely i ask pardon for having grieved you but indeed i am not prejudiced beyond the power of conviction tell me what this count of monte cristo has done for you m i own that your question embarrasses me valentine for i cannot say that the count has rendered me any ostensible service still as i have already told you i have an instinctive affection for him the source of which i cannot explain to you has the sun done anything for me no he warms me with his rays and it is by his light that i see you nothing more has such and such a perfume done anything for me no its odor charms one of my senses that
