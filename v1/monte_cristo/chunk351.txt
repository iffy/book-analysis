myself in your presence without longing to pour forth my soul and tell you how fondly i adore you if it be but to carry away with me the recollection of such sweet moments i could even thank you for chiding me for it leaves me a gleam of hope that if you did not expect me and that indeed would be worse than vanity to suppose at least i was in your thoughts you asked me the cause of my being late and why i come disguised i will candidly explain the reason of both and i trust to your goodness to pardon me i have chosen a trade a trade oh maximilian how can you jest at a time when we have such deep cause for uneasiness heaven keep me from jesting with that which is far dearer to me than life itself but listen to me valentine and i will tell you all about it i became weary of ranging fields and scaling walls and seriously alarmed at the idea suggested by you that if caught hovering about here your father would very likely have me sent to prison as a thief that would compromise the honor of the french army to say nothing of the fact that the continual presence of a captain of spahis in a place where no warlike projects could be supposed to account for it might well create surprise so i have become a gardener and consequently adopted the costume of my calling what excessive nonsense you talk maximilian nonsense pray do not call what i consider the wisest action of my life by such a name consider by becoming a gardener i effectually screen our meetings from all suspicion or danger m i beseech of you maximilian to cease trifling and tell me what you really mean simply that having ascertained that the piece of ground on which i stand was to let i made application for it was readily accepted by the proprietor and am now master of this fine crop of lucern think of that valentine there is nothing now to prevent my building myself a little hut on my plantation and residing not twenty yards from you only imagine what happiness that would afford me i can scarcely contain myself at the bare idea such felicity seems above all price as a thing impossible and unattainable but would you believe that i purchase all this delight joy and happiness for which i would cheerfully have surrendered ten years of my life at the small cost of francs per annum paid quarterly henceforth we have nothing to fear i am on my own ground and have an undoubted right to place a ladder against the wall and to look over when i please without having any apprehensions of being taken off by the police as a suspicious character i may also enjoy the precious privilege of assuring you of my fond faithful and unalterable affection whenever you visit your favorite bower unless indeed it offends your pride to listen to professions of love from the lips of a poor workingman clad in a blouse and cap a faint cry of mingled pleasure and surprise escaped from the lips of valentine who almost instantly said in a saddened tone as though some envious cloud darkened the joy which illumined her heart alas no maximilian this must not be for many reasons we should presume too much on our own strength and like others perhaps be led astray by our blind confidence in each others prudence how can you for an instant entertain so unworthy a thought dear valentine have i not from the first blessed hour of our acquaintance schooled all my words and actions
