is all i can say when i am asked why i praise it my friendship for him is as strange and unaccountable as his for me a secret voice seems to whisper to me that there must be something more than chance in this unexpected reciprocity of friendship in his most simple actions as well as in his most secret thoughts i find a relation to my own you will perhaps smile at me when i tell you that ever since i have known this man i have involuntarily entertained the idea that all the good fortune which has befallen me originated from him however i have managed to live thirty years without this protection you will say but i will endeavor a little to illustrate my meaning he invited me to dine with him on saturday which was a very natural thing for him to do well what have i learned since that your mother and m de villefort are both coming to this dinner i shall meet them there and who knows what future advantages may result from the interview this may appear to you to be no unusual combination of circumstances nevertheless i perceive some hidden plot in the arrangement something in fact more than is apparent on a casual view of the subject i believe that this singular man who appears to fathom the motives of everyone has purposely arranged for me to meet m and madame de villefort and sometimes i confess i have gone so far as to try to read in his eyes whether he was in possession of the secret of our love my good friend said valentine i should take you for a visionary and should tremble for your reason if i were always to hear you talk in a strain similar to this is it possible that you can see anything more than the merest chance in this meeting pray reflect a little my father who never goes out has several times been on the point of refusing this invitation madame de villefort on the contrary is burning with the desire of seeing this extraordinary nabob in his own house therefore she has with great difficulty prevailed on my father to accompany her no no it is as i have said maximilian there is no one in the world of whom i can ask help but yourself and my grandfather who is little better than a corpse no support to cling to but my mother in heaven i see that you are right logically speaking said maximilian but the gentle voice which usually has such power over me fails to convince me today i feel the same as regards yourself said valentine and i own that if you have no stronger proof to give me i have another replied maximilian but i fear you will deem it even more absurd than the first so much the worse said valentine smiling it is nevertheless conclusive to my mind my ten years of service have also confirmed my ideas on the subject of sudden inspirations for i have several times owed my life to a mysterious impulse which directed me to move at once either to the right or to the left in order to escape the ball which killed the comrade fighting by my side while it left me unharmed dear maximilian why not attribute your escape to my constant prayers for your safety when you are away i no longer pray for myself but for you m yes since you have known me said morrel smiling but that cannot apply to the time previous to our acquaintance valentine you are very provoking and will not give me credit for anything but let me hear this
