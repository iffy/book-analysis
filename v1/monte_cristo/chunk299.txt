to dig more freely then i confess curiosity mingled with hatred i wished to see what villefort was going to do there and i remained motionless holding my breath then an idea crossed my mind which was confirmed when i saw the procureur lift from under his mantle a box two feet long and six or eight inches deep i let him place the box in the hole he had made then while he stamped with his feet to remove all traces of his occupation i rushed on him and plunged my knife into his breast exclaiming i am giovanni bertuccio thy death for my brothers thy treasure for his widow thou seest that my vengeance is more complete than i had hoped i know not if he heard these words i think he did not for he fell without a cry i felt his blood gush over my face but i was intoxicated i was delirious and the blood refreshed instead of burning me in a second i had disinterred the box then that it might not be known i had done so i filled up the hole threw the spade over the wall and rushed through the door which i double-locked carrying off the key ah said monte cristo it seems to me this was nothing but murder and robbery no your excellency returned bertuccio it was a vendetta followed by restitution and was the sum a large one it was not money ah i recollect replied the count did you not say something of an infant yes excellency i hastened to the river sat down on the bank and with my knife forced open the lock of the box in a fine linen cloth was wrapped a new-born child its purple visage and its violet-colored hands showed that it had perished from suffocation but as it was not yet cold i hesitated to throw it into the water that ran at my feet after a moment i fancied that i felt a slight pulsation of the heart and as i had been assistant at the hospital at bastia i did what a doctor would have done i inflated the lungs by blowing air into them and at the expiration of a quarter of an hour it began to breathe and cried feebly in my turn i uttered a cry but a cry of joy god has not cursed me then i cried since he permits me to save the life of a human creature in exchange for the life i have taken away m and what did you do with the child asked monte cristo it was an embarrassing load for a man seeking to escape i had not for a moment the idea of keeping it but i knew that at paris there was an asylum where they receive such creatures as i passed the city gates i declared that i had found the child on the road and i inquired where the asylum was the box confirmed my statement the linen proved that the infant belonged to wealthy parents the blood with which i was covered might have proceeded from the child as well as from anyone else no objection was raised but they pointed out the asylum which was situated at the upper end of the rue denfer and after having taken the precaution of cutting the linen in two pieces so that one of the two letters which marked it was on the piece wrapped around the child while the other remained in my possession i rang the bell and fled with all speed a fortnight after i was at rogliano and i said to assunta console thyself sister israel is dead but he is avenged she demanded
