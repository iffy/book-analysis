let themselves down from the outer walls by means of the abbs ladder of cords dants eyes sparkled with joy and he rubbed his hands with delight at the idea of a plan so simple yet apparently so certain to succeed that very day the miners began their labors with a vigor and alacrity proportionate to their long rest from fatigue and their hopes of ultimate success nothing interrupted the progress of the work except the necessity that each was under of returning to his cell in anticipation of the turnkeys visits they had learned to distinguish the almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards their dungeons and happily never failed of being prepared for his coming the fresh earth excavated during their present work and which would have entirely blocked up the old passage was thrown by degrees and with the utmost precaution out of the window in either farias or dants cell the rubbish being first pulverized so finely that the night wind carried it far away without permitting the smallest trace to remain more than a year had been consumed in this undertaking the only tools for which had been a chisel a knife and a wooden lever faria still continuing to instruct dants by conversing with him sometimes in one language sometimes in another at others relating to him the history of nations and great men who from time to time have risen to fame and trodden the path of glory the abb was a man of the world and had moreover mixed in the first society of the day he wore an air of melancholy dignity which dants thanks to the imitative powers bestowed on him by nature easily acquired as well as that outward polish and politeness he had before been wanting in and which is seldom possessed except by those who have been placed in constant intercourse with persons of high birth and breeding at the end of fifteen months the level was finished and the excavation completed beneath the gallery and the two workmen could distinctly hear the measured tread of the sentinel as he paced to and fro over their heads compelled as they were to await a night sufficiently dark to favor their flight they were obliged to defer their final attempt till that auspicious moment should arrive their greatest dread now was lest the stone through which the sentry was doomed to fall should give way before its right time and this they had in some measure provided against by propping it up with a small beam which they had discovered in the walls through which they had worked their way dants was occupied in arranging this piece of wood when he heard faria who had remained in edmonds cell for the purpose of cutting a peg to secure their rope-ladder call to him in a tone indicative of great suffering dants hastened to his dungeon where he found him standing in the middle of the room pale as death his forehead streaming with perspiration and his hands clenched tightly together gracious heavens exclaimed dants what is the matter what has happened quick quick returned the abb listen to what i have to say dants looked in fear and wonder at the livid countenance of faria whose eyes already dull and sunken were surrounded by purple circles while his lips were white as those of a corpse and his very hair seemed to stand on end tell me i beseech you what ails you cried dants letting his chisel fall to the floor alas faltered out the abb all is over with me i am seized with a terrible perhaps mortal illness i can feel that the paroxysm is fast approaching
