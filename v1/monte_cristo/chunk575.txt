about to take place at eight oclock all were in their places and m de morcerf entered at the last stroke he held some papers in his hand his countenance was calm and his step firm and he was dressed with great care in his military uniform which was buttoned completely up to the chin his presence produced a good effect the committee was made up of liberals several of whom came forward to shake hands with him albert felt his heart bursting at these particulars but gratitude mingled with his sorrow he would gladly have embraced those who had given his father this proof of esteem at a moment when his honor was so powerfully attacked at this moment one of the door-keepers brought in a letter for the president you are at liberty to speak m de morcerf said the president as he unsealed the letter and the count began his defence i assure you albert in a most eloquent and skilful manner he produced documents proving that the vizier of yanina had up to the last moment honored him with his entire confidence since he had interested him with a negotiation of life and death with the emperor he produced the ring his mark of authority with which ali pasha generally sealed his letters and which the latter had given him that he might on his return at any hour of the day or night gain access to the presence even in the harem unfortunately the negotiation failed and when he returned to defend his benefactor he was dead but said the count so great was ali pashas confidence that on his death-bed he resigned his favorite mistress and her daughter to my care albert started on hearing these words the history of hayde recurred to him and he remembered what she had said of that message and the ring and the manner in which she had been sold and made a slave and what effect did this discourse produce anxiously inquired albert i acknowledge it affected me and indeed all the committee also said beauchamp meanwhile the president carelessly opened the letter which had been brought to him but the first lines aroused his attention he read them again and again and fixing his eyes on m de morcerf count said he you have said that the vizier of yanina confided his wife and daughter to your care yes sir replied morcerf but in that like all the rest misfortune pursued me on my return vasiliki and her daughter hayde had disappeared did you know them my intimacy with the pasha and his unlimited confidence had gained me an introduction to them and i had seen them above twenty times have you any idea what became of them yes sir i heard they had fallen victims to their sorrow and perhaps to their poverty i was not rich my life was in constant danger i could not seek them to my great regret the president frowned imperceptibly gentlemen said he you have heard the comte de morcerfs defence can you sir produce any witnesses to the truth of what you have asserted alas no monsieur replied the count all those who surrounded the vizier or who knew me at his court are either dead or gone away i know not where i believe that i alone of all my countrymen survived that dreadful war i have only the letters of ali tepelini which i have placed before you the ring a token of his good-will which is here and lastly the most convincing proof i can offer after an anonymous attack and that is the absence of any witness against my veracity and the purity of my military life a murmur
