anyone to do that alas replied the weeping girl i am obliged to own that my stepmothers aversion to me arises from a very natural source her overweening love for her own child my brother edward but why should it i do not know but though unwilling to introduce money matters into our present conversation i will just say this much that her extreme dislike to me has its origin there and i much fear she envies me the fortune i enjoy in right of my mother and which will be more than doubled at the death of m and mme de saint-mran whose sole heiress i am madame de villefort has nothing of her own and hates me for being so richly endowed alas how gladly would i exchange the half of this wealth for the happiness of at least sharing my fathers love god knows i would prefer sacrificing the whole so that it would obtain me a happy and affectionate home poor valentine i seem to myself as though living a life of bondage yet at the same time am so conscious of my own weakness that i fear to break the restraint in which i am held lest i fall utterly helpless then too my father is not a person whose orders may be infringed with impunity protected as he is by his high position and firmly established reputation for talent and unswerving integrity no one could oppose him he is all-powerful even with the king he would crush you at a word dear maximilian believe me when i assure you that if i do not attempt to resist my fathers commands it is more on your account than my own but why valentine do you persist in anticipating the worst why picture so gloomy a future because i judge it from the past still consider that although i may not be strictly speaking what is termed an illustrious match for you i am for many reasons not altogether so much beneath your alliance the days when such distinctions were so nicely weighed and considered no longer exist in france and the first families of the monarchy have intermarried with those of the empire the aristocracy of the lance has allied itself with the nobility of the cannon now i belong to this last-named class and certainly my prospects of military preferment are most encouraging as well as certain my fortune though small is free and unfettered and the memory of my late father is respected in our country valentine as that of the most upright and honorable merchant of the city i say our country because you were born not far from marseilles dont speak of marseilles i beg of you maximilian that one word brings back my mother to my recollection my angel mother who died too soon for myself and all who knew her but who after watching over her child during the brief period allotted to her in this world now i fondly hope watches from her home in heaven oh if my mother were still living there would be nothing to fear maximilian for i would tell her that i loved you and she would protect us i fear valentine replied the lover that were she living i should never have had the happiness of knowing you you would then have been too happy to have stooped from your grandeur to bestow a thought on me now it is you who are unjust maximilian cried valentine but there is one thing i wish to know and what is that inquired the young man perceiving that valentine hesitated tell me truly maximilian whether in former days when our fathers dwelt at marseilles there was ever any misunderstanding
