interrogate him m de villefort said louis xviii the duc de blacas assures me you have some interesting information to communicate sire the duke is right and i believe your majesty will think it equally important m in the first place and before everything else sir is the news as bad in your opinion as i am asked to believe sire i believe it to be most urgent but i hope by the speed i have used that it is not irreparable speak as fully as you please sir said the king who began to give way to the emotion which had showed itself in blacass face and affected villeforts voice speak sir and pray begin at the beginning i like order in everything sire said villefort i will render a faithful report to your majesty but i must entreat your forgiveness if my anxiety leads to some obscurity in my language a glance at the king after this discreet and subtle exordium assured villefort of the benignity of his august auditor and he went on sire i have come as rapidly to paris as possible to inform your majesty that i have discovered in the exercise of my duties not a commonplace and insignificant plot such as is every day got up in the lower ranks of the people and in the army but an actual conspiracy a storm which menaces no less than your majestys throne sire the usurper is arming three ships he meditates some project which however mad is yet perhaps terrible at this moment he will have left elba to go whither i know not but assuredly to attempt a landing either at naples or on the coast of tuscany or perhaps on the shores of france your majesty is well aware that the sovereign of the island of elba has maintained his relations with italy and france i am sir said the king much agitated and recently we have had information that the bonapartist clubs have had meetings in the rue saint-jacques but proceed i beg of you how did you obtain these details sire they are the results of an examination which i have made of a man of marseilles whom i have watched for some time and arrested on the day of my departure this person a sailor of turbulent character and whom i suspected of bonapartism has been secretly to the island of elba there he saw the grand-marshal who charged him with an oral message to a bonapartist in paris whose name i could not extract from him but this mission was to prepare mens minds for a return it is the man who says this sire a return which will soon occur and where is this man in prison sire and the matter seems serious to you so serious sire that when the circumstance surprised me in the midst of a family festival on the very day of my betrothal i left my bride and friends postponing everything that i might hasten to lay at your majestys feet the fears which impressed me and the assurance of my devotion true said louis xviii was there not a marriage engagement between you and mademoiselle de saint-mran daughter of one of your majestys most faithful servants yes yes but let us talk of this plot m de villefort sire i fear it is more than a plot i fear it is a conspiracy a conspiracy in these times said louis xviii smiling is a thing very easy to meditate but more difficult to conduct to an end inasmuch as re-established so recently on the throne of our ancestors we have our eyes open at once upon the past the present and the future for the last
