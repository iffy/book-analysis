who hearing no news of her lover had come unobserved to inquire after him as villefort drew near she advanced and stood before him dants had spoken of mercds and villefort instantly recognized her her beauty and high bearing surprised him and when she inquired what had become of her lover it seemed to him that she was the judge and he the accused the young man you speak of said villefort abruptly is a great criminal and i can do nothing for him mademoiselle mercds burst into tears and as villefort strove to pass her again addressed him but at least tell me where he is that i may know whether he is alive or dead said she m i do not know he is no longer in my hands replied villefort and desirous of putting an end to the interview he pushed by her and closed the door as if to exclude the pain he felt but remorse is not thus banished like virgils wounded hero he carried the arrow in his wound and arrived at the salon villefort uttered a sigh that was almost a sob and sank into a chair then the first pangs of an unending torture seized upon his heart the man he sacrificed to his ambition that innocent victim immolated on the altar of his fathers faults appeared to him pale and threatening leading his affianced bride by the hand and bringing with him remorse not such as the ancients figured furious and terrible but that slow and consuming agony whose pangs are intensified from hour to hour up to the very moment of death then he had a moments hesitation he had frequently called for capital punishment on criminals and owing to his irresistible eloquence they had been condemned and yet the slightest shadow of remorse had never clouded villeforts brow because they were guilty at least he believed so but here was an innocent man whose happiness he had destroyed in this case he was not the judge but the executioner as he thus reflected he felt the sensation we have described and which had hitherto been unknown to him arise in his bosom and fill him with vague apprehensions it is thus that a wounded man trembles instinctively at the approach of the finger to his wound until it be healed but villeforts was one of those that never close or if they do only close to reopen more agonizing than ever if at this moment the sweet voice of rene had sounded in his ears pleading for mercy or the fair mercds had entered and said in the name of god i conjure you to restore me my affianced husband his cold and trembling hands would have signed his release but no voice broke the stillness of the chamber and the door was opened only by villeforts valet who came to tell him that the travelling carriage was in readiness villefort rose or rather sprang from his chair hastily opened one of the drawers of his desk emptied all the gold it contained into his pocket stood motionless an instant his hand pressed to his head muttered a few inarticulate sounds and then perceiving that his servant had placed his cloak on his shoulders he sprang into the carriage ordering the postilions to drive to m de saint-mrans the hapless dants was doomed as the marquis had promised villefort found the marquise and rene in waiting he started when he saw rene for he fancied she was again about to plead for dants alas her emotions were wholly personal she was thinking only of villeforts departure she loved villefort and he left her at the moment he was about to become her husband villefort
