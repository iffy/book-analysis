franz was fascinated by the horrible spectacle the two assistants had borne andrea to the scaffold and there in spite of his struggles his bites and his cries had forced him to his knees during this time the executioner had raised his mace and signed to them to get out of the way the criminal strove to rise but ere he had time the mace fell on his left temple a dull and heavy sound was heard and the man dropped like an ox on his face and then turned over on his back the executioner let fall his mace drew his knife and with one stroke opened his throat and mounting on his stomach stamped violently on it with his feet at every stroke a jet of blood sprang from the wound this time franz could contain himself no longer but sank half fainting into a seat albert with his eyes closed was standing grasping the window-curtains the count was erect and triumphant like the avenging angel chapter the carnival at rome when franz recovered his senses he saw albert drinking a glass of water of which to judge from his pallor he stood in great need and the count who was assuming his masquerade costume he glanced mechanically towards the piazza the scene was wholly changed scaffold executioners victims all had disappeared only the people remained full of noise and excitement the bell of monte citorio which only sounds on the popes decease and the opening of the carnival was ringing a joyous peal well asked he of the count what has then happened nothing replied the count only as you see the carnival has commenced make haste and dress yourself in fact said franz this horrible scene has passed away like a dream it is but a dream a nightmare that has disturbed you yes that i have suffered but the culprit that is a dream also only he has remained asleep while you have awakened and who knows which of you is the most fortunate but peppino what has become of him peppino is a lad of sense who unlike most men who are happy in proportion as they are noticed was delighted to see that the general attention was directed towards his companion he profited by this distraction to slip away among the crowd without even thanking the worthy priests who accompanied him decidedly man is an ungrateful and egotistical animal but dress yourself see m de morcerf sets you the example albert was drawing on the satin pantaloon over his black trousers and varnished boots well albert said franz do you feel much inclined to join the revels come answer frankly ma foi no returned albert but i am really glad to have seen such a sight and i understand what the count said that when you have once habituated yourself to a similar spectacle it is the only one that causes you any emotion m without reflecting that this is the only moment in which you can study character said the count on the steps of the scaffold death tears off the mask that has been worn through life and the real visage is disclosed it must be allowed that andrea was not very handsome the hideous scoundrel come dress yourselves gentlemen dress yourselves franz felt it would be ridiculous not to follow his two companions example he assumed his costume and fastened on the mask that scarcely equalled the pallor of his own face their toilet finished they descended the carriage awaited them at the door filled with sweetmeats and bouquets they fell into the line of carriages it is difficult to form an idea of the perfect change that had taken place instead of the spectacle
