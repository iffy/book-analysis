name of edmond dants every eye was turned towards the young man who spite of the agitation he could not but feel advanced with dignity and said in a firm voice i am he what is your pleasure with me edmond dants replied the magistrate i arrest you in the name of the law me repeated edmond slightly changing color and wherefore i pray i cannot inform you but you will be duly acquainted with the reasons that have rendered such a step necessary at the preliminary examination m morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was useless he saw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law and perfectly well knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate decked with his official scarf as to address a petition to some cold marble effigy old dants however sprang forward there are situations which the heart of a father or a mother cannot be made to understand he prayed and supplicated in terms so moving that even the officer was touched and although firm in his duty he kindly said my worthy friend let me beg of you to calm your apprehensions your son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his cargo and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly he has given the information required whether touching the health of his crew or the value of his freight what is the meaning of all this inquired caderousse frowningly of danglars who had assumed an air of utter surprise m how can i tell you replied he i am like yourself utterly bewildered at all that is going on and cannot in the least make out what it is about caderousse then looked around for fernand but he had disappeared the scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with startling clearness the painful catastrophe he had just witnessed appeared effectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication of the evening before had raised between himself and his memory so so said he in a hoarse and choking voice to danglars this then i suppose is a part of the trick you were concerting yesterday all i can say is that if it be so tis an ill turn and well deserves to bring double evil on those who have projected it nonsense returned danglars i tell you again i have nothing whatever to do with it besides you know very well that i tore the paper to pieces no you did not answered caderousse you merely threw it by i saw it lying in a corner hold your tongue you fool what should you know about it why you were drunk where is fernand inquired caderousse how do i know replied danglars gone as every prudent man ought to be to look after his own affairs most likely never mind where he is let you and i go and see what is to be done for our poor friends during this conversation dants after having exchanged a cheerful shake of the hand with all his sympathizing friends had surrendered himself to the officer sent to arrest him merely saying make yourselves quite easy my good fellows there is some little mistake to clear up thats all depend upon it and very likely i may not have to go so far as the prison to effect that m oh to be sure responded danglars who had now approached the group nothing more than a mistake i feel quite certain dants descended the staircase preceded by the magistrate and followed by the soldiers a carriage awaited him at the door he got in followed by two soldiers
