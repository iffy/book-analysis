the sender of the message i began to think of genii sylphs gnomes in short of all the ministers of the occult sciences until i laughed aloud at the freaks of my own imagination now it never occurred to me to wish for a nearer inspection of these large insects with their long black claws for i always feared to find under their stone wings some little human genius fagged to death with cabals factions and government intrigues but one fine day i learned that the mover of this telegraph was only a poor wretch hired for twelve hundred francs a year and employed all day not in studying the heavens like an astronomer or in gazing on the water like an angler or even in enjoying the privilege of observing the country around him but all his monotonous life was passed in watching his white-bellied black-clawed fellow insect four or five leagues distant from him at length i felt a desire to study this living chrysalis more closely and to endeavor to understand the secret part played by these insect-actors when they occupy themselves simply with pulling different pieces of string m and are you going there i am what telegraph do you intend visiting that of the home department or of the observatory oh no i should find there people who would force me to understand things of which i would prefer to remain ignorant and who would try to explain to me in spite of myself a mystery which even they do not understand ma foi i should wish to keep my illusions concerning insects unimpaired it is quite enough to have those dissipated which i had formed of my fellow-creatures i shall therefore not visit either of these telegraphs but one in the open country where i shall find a good-natured simpleton who knows no more than the machine he is employed to work you are a singular man said villefort what line would you advise me to study the one that is most in use just at this time the spanish one you mean i suppose yes should you like a letter to the minister that they might explain to you no said monte cristo since as i told you before i do not wish to comprehend it the moment i understand it there will no longer exist a telegraph for me it will be nothing more than a sign from m duchtel or from m montalivet transmitted to the prefect of bayonne mystified by two greek words tle graphein it is the insect with black claws and the awful word which i wish to retain in my imagination in all its purity and all its importance go then for in the course of two hours it will be dark and you will not be able to see anything ma foi you frighten me which is the nearest way bayonne yes the road to bayonne and afterwards the road to chtillon yes by the tower of montlhry you mean yes thank you good-bye on saturday i will tell you my impressions concerning the telegraph at the door the count was met by the two notaries who had just completed the act which was to disinherit valentine and who were leaving under the conviction of having done a thing which could not fail of redounding considerably to their credit chapter how a gardener may get rid of the dormice that eat his peaches not on the same night as he had stated but the next morning the count of monte cristo went out by the barrire denfer taking the road to orlans leaving the village of linas without stopping at the telegraph which flourished its great bony arms as he passed
