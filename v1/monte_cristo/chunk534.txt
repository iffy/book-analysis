remain on amicable terms with me i should have said patience my friend but you have constituted yourself my enemy therefore i say what does that signify to me sir well let it be three weeks then said morcerf but remember at the expiration of that time no delay or subterfuge will justify you in m albert de morcerf said beauchamp rising in his turn i cannot throw you out of window for three weeks that is to say for twenty-four days to come nor have you any right to split my skull open till that time has elapsed today is the th of august the st of september will therefore be the conclusion of the term agreed on and till that time arrives and it is the advice of a gentleman which i am about to give you till then we will refrain from growling and barking like two dogs chained within sight of each other when he had concluded his speech beauchamp bowed coldly to albert turned his back upon him and went to the press-room albert vented his anger on a pile of newspapers which he sent flying all over the office by switching them violently with his stick after which ebullition he departed not however without walking several times to the door of the press-room as if he had half a mind to enter m while albert was lashing the front of his carriage in the same manner that he had the newspapers which were the innocent agents of his discomfiture as he was crossing the barrier he perceived morrel who was walking with a quick step and a bright eye he was passing the chinese baths and appeared to have come from the direction of the porte saint-martin and to be going towards the madeleine ah said morcerf there goes a happy man and it so happened albert was not mistaken in his opinion chapter the lemonade morrel was in fact very happy m noirtier had just sent for him and he was in such haste to know the reason of his doing so that he had not stopped to take a cab placing infinitely more dependence on his own two legs than on the four legs of a cab-horse he had therefore set off at a furious rate from the rue meslay and was hastening with rapid strides in the direction of the faubourg saint-honor morrel advanced with a firm manly tread and poor barrois followed him as he best might morrel was only thirty-one barrois was sixty years of age morrel was deeply in love and barrois was dying with heat and exertion these two men thus opposed in age and interests resembled two parts of a triangle presenting the extremes of separation yet nevertheless possessing their point of union this point of union was noirtier and it was he who had just sent for morrel with the request that the latter would lose no time in coming to him a command which morrel obeyed to the letter to the great discomfiture of barrois on arriving at the house morrel was not even out of breath for love lends wings to our desires but barrois who had long forgotten what it was to love was sorely fatigued by the expedition he had been constrained to use the old servant introduced morrel by a private entrance closed the door of the study and soon the rustling of a dress announced the arrival of valentine she looked marvellously beautiful in her deep mourning dress and morrel experienced such intense delight in gazing upon her that he felt as if he could almost have dispensed with the conversation of her grandfather but the easy-chair of the old man was heard rolling
