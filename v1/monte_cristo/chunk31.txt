thing yet m do you indeed think so inquired the marquise i am at least fearful of it napoleon in the island of elba is too near france and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans marseilles is filled with half-pay officers who are daily under one frivolous pretext or other getting up quarrels with the royalists from hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of persons and assassinations in the lower you have heard perhaps said the comte de salvieux one of m de saint-mrans oldest friends and chamberlain to the comte dartois that the holy alliance purpose removing him from thence yes they were talking about it when we left paris said m de saint-mran and where is it decided to transfer him to saint helena for heavens sake where is that asked the marquise an island situated on the other side of the equator at least two thousand leagues from here replied the count so much the better as villefort observes it is a great act of folly to have left such a man between corsica where he was born and naples of which his brother-in-law is king and face to face with italy the sovereignty of which he coveted for his son unfortunately said villefort there are the treaties of and we cannot molest napoleon without breaking those compacts oh well we shall find some way out of it responded m de salvieux there wasnt any trouble over treaties when it was a question of shooting the poor duc denghien well said the marquise it seems probable that by the aid of the holy alliance we shall be rid of napoleon and we must trust to the vigilance of m de villefort to purify marseilles of his partisans the king is either a king or no king if he be acknowledged as sovereign of france he should be upheld in peace and tranquillity and this can best be effected by employing the most inflexible agents to put down every attempt at conspiracy tis the best and surest means of preventing mischief unfortunately madame answered villefort the strong arm of the law is not called upon to interfere until the evil has taken place then all he has got to do is to endeavor to repair it nay madame the law is frequently powerless to effect this all it can do is to avenge the wrong done oh m de villefort cried a beautiful young creature daughter to the comte de salvieux and the cherished friend of mademoiselle de saint-mran do try and get up some famous trial while we are at marseilles i never was in a law-court i am told it is so very amusing amusing certainly replied the young man inasmuch as instead of shedding tears as at the fictitious tale of woe produced at a theatre you behold in a law-court a case of real and genuine distress a drama of life the prisoner whom you there see pale agitated and alarmed instead of as is the case when a curtain falls on a tragedy going home to sup peacefully with his family and then retiring to rest that he may recommence his mimic woes on the morrow is removed from your sight merely to be reconducted to his prison and delivered up to the executioner i leave you to judge how far your nerves are calculated to bear you through such a scene of this however be assured that should any favorable opportunity present itself i will not fail to offer you the choice of being present for shame m de villefort said rene becoming quite pale dont you see how you are frightening us and yet you laugh what would you
