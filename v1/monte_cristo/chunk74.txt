carrying out his purpose edmond had not spoken to the attendant had not answered him when he inquired what was the matter with him and turned his face to the wall when he looked too curiously at him but now the jailer might hear the noise and put an end to it and so destroy a ray of something like hope that soothed his last moments the jailer brought him his breakfast dants raised himself up and began to talk about everything about the bad quality of the food about the coldness of his dungeon grumbling and complaining in order to have an excuse for speaking louder and wearying the patience of his jailer who out of kindness of heart had brought broth and white bread for his prisoner fortunately he fancied that dants was delirious and placing the food on the rickety table he withdrew edmond listened and the sound became more and more distinct there can be no doubt about it thought he it is some prisoner who is striving to obtain his freedom oh if i were only there to help him suddenly another idea took possession of his mind so used to misfortune that it was scarcely capable of hope the idea that the noise was made by workmen the governor had ordered to repair the neighboring dungeon it was easy to ascertain this but how could he risk the question it was easy to call his jailers attention to the noise and watch his countenance as he listened but might he not by this means destroy hopes far more important than the short-lived satisfaction of his own curiosity unfortunately edmonds brain was still so feeble that he could not bend his thoughts to anything in particular he saw but one means of restoring lucidity and clearness to his judgment he turned his eyes towards the soup which the jailer had brought rose staggered towards it raised the vessel to his lips and drank off the contents with a feeling of indescribable pleasure he had the resolution to stop with this he had often heard that shipwrecked persons had died through having eagerly devoured too much food edmond replaced on the table the bread he was about to devour and returned to his couch he did not wish to die he soon felt that his ideas became again collected he could think and strengthen his thoughts by reasoning then he said to himself i must put this to the test but without compromising anybody if it is a workman i need but knock against the wall and he will cease to work in order to find out who is knocking and why he does so but as his occupation is sanctioned by the governor he will soon resume it if on the contrary it is a prisoner the noise i make will alarm him he will cease and not begin again until he thinks everyone is asleep edmond rose again but this time his legs did not tremble and his sight was clear he went to a corner of his dungeon detached a stone and with it knocked against the wall where the sound came he struck thrice at the first blow the sound ceased as if by magic edmond listened intently an hour passed two hours passed and no sound was heard from the wall all was silent there full of hope edmond swallowed a few mouthfuls of bread and water and thanks to the vigor of his constitution found himself well-nigh recovered the day passed away in utter silence night came without recurrence of the noise it is a prisoner said edmond joyfully his brain was on fire and life and energy returned the night passed in perfect silence
