dappled grays the baron followed by the count traversed a long series of apartments in which the prevailing characteristics were heavy magnificence and the gaudiness of ostentatious wealth until he reached the boudoir of madame danglars a small octagonal-shaped room hung with pink satin covered with white indian muslin the chairs were of ancient workmanship and materials over the doors were painted sketches of shepherds and shepherdesses after the style and manner of boucher and at each side pretty medallions in crayons harmonizing well with the furnishings of this charming apartment the only one throughout the great mansion in which any distinctive taste prevailed the truth was it had been entirely overlooked in the plan arranged and followed out by m danglars and his architect who had been selected to aid the baron in the great work of improvement solely because he was the most fashionable and celebrated decorator of the day the decorations of the boudoir had then been left entirely to madame danglars and lucien debray m danglars however while possessing a great admiration for the antique as it was understood during the time of the directory entertained the most sovereign contempt for the simple elegance of his wifes favorite sitting-room where by the way he was never permitted to intrude unless indeed he excused his own appearance by ushering in some more agreeable visitor than himself and even then he had rather the air and manner of a person who was himself introduced than that of being the presenter of another his reception being cordial or frigid in proportion as the person who accompanied him chanced to please or displease the baroness madame danglars who although past the first bloom of youth was still strikingly handsome was now seated at the piano a most elaborate piece of cabinet and inlaid work while lucien debray standing before a small work-table was turning over the pages of an album lucien had found time preparatory to the counts arrival to relate many particulars respecting him to madame danglars it will be remembered that monte cristo had made a lively impression on the minds of all the party assembled at the breakfast given by albert de morcerf and although debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings he had never been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the impressive look and manner of the count consequently the description given by lucien to the baroness bore the highly-colored tinge of his own heated imagination already excited by the wonderful stories related of the count by de morcerf it is no wonder that madame danglars eagerly listened to and fully credited all the additional circumstances detailed by debray this posing at the piano and over the album was only a little ruse adopted by way of precaution a most gracious welcome and unusual smile were bestowed on m danglars the count in return for his gentlemanly bow received a formal though graceful courtesy while lucien exchanged with the count a sort of distant recognition and with danglars a free and easy nod baroness said danglars give me leave to present to you the count of monte cristo who has been most warmly recommended to me by my correspondents at rome i need but mention one fact to make all the ladies in paris court his notice and that is that he has come to take up his abode in paris for a year during which brief period he proposes to spend six millions of money that means balls dinners and lawn parties without end in all of which i trust the count will remember us as he may depend upon it we shall him in our own humble entertainments
