were overheard i might be taken so i put it off until the next occasion and in order that nothing should escape me i took a chamber looking into the street bordered by the wall of the garden three days after about seven oclock in the evening i saw a servant on horseback leave the house at full gallop and take the road to svres i concluded that he was going to versailles and i was not deceived three hours later the man returned covered with dust his errand was performed and two minutes after another man on foot muffled in a mantle opened the little door of the garden which he closed after him i descended rapidly although i had not seen villeforts face i recognized him by the beating of my heart i crossed the street and stopped at a post placed at the angle of the wall and by means of which i had once before looked into the garden this time i did not content myself with looking but i took my knife out of my pocket felt that the point was sharp and sprang over the wall my first care was to run to the door he had left the key in it taking the simple precaution of turning it twice in the lock nothing then preventing my escape by this means i examined the grounds the garden was long and narrow a stretch of smooth turf extended down the middle and at the corners were clumps of trees with thick and massy foliage that made a background for the shrubs and flowers in order to go from the door to the house or from the house to the door m de villefort would be obliged to pass by one of these clumps of trees m it was the end of september the wind blew violently the faint glimpses of the pale moon hidden momentarily by masses of dark clouds that were sweeping across the sky whitened the gravel walks that led to the house but were unable to pierce the obscurity of the thick shrubberies in which a man could conceal himself without any fear of discovery i hid myself in the one nearest to the path villefort must take and scarcely was i there when amidst the gusts of wind i fancied i heard groans but you know or rather you do not know your excellency that he who is about to commit an assassination fancies that he hears low cries perpetually ringing in his ears two hours passed thus during which i imagined i heard moans repeatedly midnight struck as the last stroke died away i saw a faint light shine through the windows of the private staircase by which we have just descended the door opened and the man in the mantle reappeared the terrible moment had come but i had so long been prepared for it that my heart did not fail in the least i drew my knife from my pocket again opened it and made ready to strike the man in the mantle advanced towards me but as he drew near i saw that he had a weapon in his hand i was afraid not of a struggle but of a failure when he was only a few paces from me i saw that what i had taken for a weapon was only a spade i was still unable to divine for what reason m de villefort had this spade in his hands when he stopped close to the thicket where i was glanced round and began to dig a hole in the earth i then perceived that he was hiding something under his mantle which he laid on the grass in order
