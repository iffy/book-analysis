lustre of our high position i inherit my fathers name and i do not choose that the shadow of disgrace should darken it i am going to beauchamp in whose journal this paragraph appears and i shall insist on his retracting the assertion before two witnesses beauchamp will never retract then we must fight no you will not for he will tell you what is very true that perhaps there were fifty officers in the greek army bearing the same name we will fight nevertheless i will efface that blot on my fathers character my father who was such a brave soldier whose career was so brilliant oh well he will add we are warranted in believing that this fernand is not the illustrious count of morcerf who also bears the same christian name i am determined not to be content with anything short of an entire retractation and you intend to make him do it in the presence of two witnesses do you yes you do wrong which means i suppose that you refuse the service which i asked of you you know my theory regarding duels i told you my opinion on that subject if you remember when we were at rome nevertheless my dear count i found you this morning engaged in an occupation but little consistent with the notions you profess to entertain because my dear fellow you understand one must never be eccentric if ones lot is cast among fools it is necessary to study folly i shall perhaps find myself one day called out by some harebrained scamp who has no more real cause of quarrel with me than you have with beauchamp he may take me to task for some foolish trifle or other he will bring his witnesses or will insult me in some public place and i am expected to kill him for all that you admit that you would fight then well if so why do you object to my doing so i do not say that you ought not to fight i only say that a duel is a serious thing and ought not to be undertaken without due reflection did he reflect before he insulted my father if he spoke hastily and owns that he did so you ought to be satisfied ah my dear count you are far too indulgent and you are far too exacting supposing for instance and do not be angry at what i am going to say well supposing the assertion to be really true a son ought not to submit to such a stain on his fathers honor ma foi we live in times when there is much to which we must submit that is precisely the fault of the age and do you undertake to reform it yes as far as i am personally concerned well you are indeed exacting my dear fellow yes i own it are you quite impervious to good advice not when it comes from a friend and do you account me that title certainly i do well then before going to beauchamp with your witnesses seek further information on the subject from whom from hayde why what can be the use of mixing a woman up in the affair what can she do in it she can declare to you for example that your father had no hand whatever in the defeat and death of the vizier or if by chance he had indeed the misfortune to i have told you my dear count that i would not for one moment admit of such a proposition you reject this means of information then i do most decidedly then let me offer one more word of advice do so then but let
