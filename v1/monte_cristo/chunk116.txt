left by turning to the left therefore he would find it but as we have said it was at least a league from the chteau dif to this island often in prison faria had said to him when he saw him idle and inactive dants you must not give way to this listlessness you will be drowned if you seek to escape and your strength has not been properly exercised and prepared for exertion these words rang in dants ears even beneath the waves he hastened to cleave his way through them to see if he had not lost his strength he found with pleasure that his captivity had taken away nothing of his power and that he was still master of that element on whose bosom he had so often sported as a boy fear that relentless pursuer clogged dants efforts he listened for any sound that might be audible and every time that he rose to the top of a wave he scanned the horizon and strove to penetrate the darkness he fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat and he redoubled his exertions increasing rapidly his distance from the chteau but exhausting his strength he swam on still and already the terrible chteau had disappeared in the darkness he could not see it but he felt its presence an hour passed during which dants excited by the feeling of freedom continued to cleave the waves let us see said he i have swum above an hour but as the wind is against me that has retarded my speed however if i am not mistaken i must be close to tiboulen but what if i were mistaken a shudder passed over him he sought to tread water in order to rest himself but the sea was too violent and he felt that he could not make use of this means of recuperation well said he i will swim on until i am worn out or the cramp seizes me and then i shall sink and he struck out with the energy of despair suddenly the sky seemed to him to become still darker and more dense and heavy clouds seemed to sweep down towards him at the same time he felt a sharp pain in his knee he fancied for a moment that he had been shot and listened for the report but he heard nothing then he put out his hand and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew that he had gained the shore before him rose a grotesque mass of rocks that resembled nothing so much as a vast fire petrified at the moment of its most fervent combustion it was the island of tiboulen dants rose advanced a few steps and with a fervent prayer of gratitude stretched himself on the granite which seemed to him softer than down then in spite of the wind and rain he fell into the deep sweet sleep of utter exhaustion at the expiration of an hour edmond was awakened by the roar of thunder the tempest was let loose and beating the atmosphere with its mighty wings from time to time a flash of lightning stretched across the heavens like a fiery serpent lighting up the clouds that rolled on in vast chaotic waves dants had not been deceived he had reached the first of the two islands which was in fact tiboulen he knew that it was barren and without shelter but when the sea became more calm he resolved to plunge into its waves again and swim to lemaire equally arid but larger and consequently better adapted for concealment an overhanging rock offered him a temporary shelter and scarcely had he availed himself of it when
