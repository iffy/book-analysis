of rock like the giant adamastor rose dead ahead a formidable barrier and intercepting the light that gilded its massive peaks so that the voyagers were in shadow little by little the shadow rose higher and seemed to drive before it the last rays of the expiring day at last the reflection rested on the summit of the mountain where it paused an instant like the fiery crest of a volcano then gloom gradually covered the summit as it had covered the base and the island now only appeared to be a gray mountain that grew continually darker half an hour after the night was quite dark fortunately the mariners were used to these latitudes and knew every rock in the tuscan archipelago for in the midst of this obscurity franz was not without uneasiness corsica had long since disappeared and monte cristo itself was invisible but the sailors seemed like the lynx to see in the dark and the pilot who steered did not evince the slightest hesitation an hour had passed since the sun had set when franz fancied he saw at a quarter of a mile to the left a dark mass but he could not precisely make out what it was and fearing to excite the mirth of the sailors by mistaking a floating cloud for land he remained silent suddenly a great light appeared on the strand land might resemble a cloud but the fire was not a meteor what is this light asked he hush said the captain it is a fire but you told me the island was uninhabited i said there were no fixed habitations on it but i said also that it served sometimes as a harbor for smugglers and for pirates and for pirates returned gaetano repeating franzs words it is for that reason i have given orders to pass the island for as you see the fire is behind us but this fire continued franz it seems to me rather reassuring than otherwise men who did not wish to be seen would not light a fire oh that goes for nothing said gaetano if you can guess the position of the island in the darkness you will see that the fire cannot be seen from the side or from pianosa but only from the sea you think then this fire indicates the presence of unpleasant neighbors that is what we must find out returned gaetano fixing his eyes on this terrestrial star how can you find out you shall see gaetano consulted with his companions and after five minutes discussion a manuvre was executed which caused the vessel to tack about they returned the way they had come and in a few minutes the fire disappeared hidden by an elevation of the land the pilot again changed the course of the boat which rapidly approached the island and was soon within fifty paces of it gaetano lowered the sail and the boat came to rest all this was done in silence and from the moment that their course was changed not a word was spoken gaetano who had proposed the expedition had taken all the responsibility on himself the four sailors fixed their eyes on him while they got out their oars and held themselves in readiness to row away which thanks to the darkness would not be difficult as for franz he examined his arms with the utmost coolness he had two double-barrelled guns and a rifle he loaded them looked at the priming and waited quietly during this time the captain had thrown off his vest and shirt and secured his trousers round his waist his feet were naked so he had no shoes and stockings to take off after these preparations
