chteau-renaud exchanged looks of astonishment i think i understand his reason said morrel what is it yesterday afternoon i received a letter from m de morcerf begging me to attend the opera and i said debray and i also said franz and we too added beauchamp and chteau-renaud having wished you all to witness the challenge he now wishes you to be present at the combat exactly so said the young men you have probably guessed right but after all these arrangements he does not come himself said chteau-renaud albert is ten minutes after time there he comes said beauchamp on horseback at full gallop followed by a servant how imprudent said chteau-renaud to come on horseback to fight a duel with pistols after all the instructions i had given him and besides said beauchamp with a collar above his cravat an open coat and white waistcoat why has he not painted a spot upon his heart it would have been more simple meanwhile albert had arrived within ten paces of the group formed by the five young men he jumped from his horse threw the bridle on his servants arms and joined them he was pale and his eyes were red and swollen it was evident that he had not slept a shade of melancholy gravity overspread his countenance which was not natural to him i thank you gentlemen said he for having complied with my request i feel extremely grateful for this mark of friendship morrel had stepped back as morcerf approached and remained at a short distance and to you also m morrel my thanks are due come there cannot be too many m sir said maximilian you are not perhaps aware that i am m de monte cristos friend i was not sure but i thought it might be so so much the better the more honorable men there are here the better i shall be satisfied m morrel said chteau-renaud will you apprise the count of monte cristo that m de morcerf is arrived and we are at his disposal morrel was preparing to fulfil his commission beauchamp had meanwhile drawn the box of pistols from the carriage stop gentlemen said albert i have two words to say to the count of monte cristo in private asked morrel no sir before all who are here alberts witnesses looked at each other franz and debray exchanged some words in a whisper and morrel rejoiced at this unexpected incident went to fetch the count who was walking in a retired path with emmanuel what does he want with me said monte cristo i do not know but he wishes to speak to you ah said monte cristo i trust he is not going to tempt me by some fresh insult i do not think that such is his intention said morrel the count advanced accompanied by maximilian and emmanuel his calm and serene look formed a singular contrast to alberts grief-stricken face who approached also followed by the other four young men when at three paces distant from each other albert and the count stopped approach gentlemen said albert i wish you not to lose one word of what i am about to have the honor of saying to the count of monte cristo for it must be repeated by you to all who will listen to it strange as it may appear to you proceed sir said the count sir said albert at first with a tremulous voice but which gradually became firmer i reproached you with exposing the conduct of m de morcerf in epirus for guilty as i knew he was i thought you had no right to punish him but i have since learned that you had that
