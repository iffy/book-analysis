the ungovernable spirit and maddened speed of the same horses he was actually compelled to apply his whip in no very gentle manner before he could induce them to start and even then all that could be obtained from the celebrated dappled grays now changed into a couple of dull sluggish stupid brutes was a slow pottering pace kept up with so much difficulty that madame de villefort was more than two hours returning to her residence in the faubourg saint-honor m scarcely had the first congratulations upon her marvellous escape been gone through when she wrote the following letter to madame danglars dear hermine i have just had a wonderful escape from the most imminent danger and i owe my safety to the very count of monte cristo we were talking about yesterday but whom i little expected to see today i remember how unmercifully i laughed at what i considered your eulogistic and exaggerated praises of him but i have now ample cause to admit that your enthusiastic description of this wonderful man fell far short of his merits your horses got as far as ranelagh when they darted forward like mad things and galloped away at so fearful a rate that there seemed no other prospect for myself and my poor edward but that of being dashed to pieces against the first object that impeded their progress when a strange-looking man an arab a negro or a nubian at least a black of some nation or other at a signal from the count whose domestic he is suddenly seized and stopped the infuriated animals even at the risk of being trampled to death himself and certainly he must have had a most wonderful escape the count then hastened to us and took us into his house where he speedily recalled my poor edward to life he sent us home in his own carriage yours will be returned to you tomorrow you will find your horses in bad condition from the results of this accident they seem thoroughly stupefied as if sulky and vexed at having been conquered by man the count however has commissioned me to assure you that two or three days rest with plenty of barley for their sole food during that time will bring them back to as fine that is as terrifying a condition as they were in yesterday m adieu i cannot return you many thanks for the drive of yesterday but after all i ought not to blame you for the misconduct of your horses more especially as it procured me the pleasure of an introduction to the count of monte cristo and certainly that illustrious personage apart from the millions he is said to be so very anxious to dispose of seemed to me one of those curiously interesting problems i for one delight in solving at any risk even if it were to necessitate another drive to the bois behind your horses edward endured the accident with miraculous courage he did not utter a single cry but fell lifeless into my arms nor did a tear fall from his eyes after it was over i doubt not you will consider these praises the result of blind maternal affection but there is a soul of iron in that delicate fragile body valentine sends many affectionate remembrances to your dear eugnie i embrace you with all my heart hlose de villefort ps do pray contrive some means for me to meet the count of monte cristo at your house i must and will see him again i have just made m de villefort promise to call on him and i hope the visit will be returned that night the adventure at auteuil was talked of everywhere
