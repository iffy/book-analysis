his hands at this signal four soldiers of the seraskier kourchid suddenly appeared and selim fell pierced by five blows each man had stabbed him separately and intoxicated by their crime though still pale with fear they sought all over the cavern to discover if there was any fear of fire after which they amused themselves by rolling on the bags of gold at this moment my mother seized me in her arms and hurrying noiselessly along numerous turnings and windings known only to ourselves she arrived at a private staircase of the kiosk where was a scene of frightful tumult and confusion the lower rooms were entirely filled with kourchids troops that is to say with our enemies just as my mother was on the point of pushing open a small door we heard the voice of the pasha sounding in a loud and threatening tone my mother applied her eye to the crack between the boards i luckily found a small opening which afforded me a view of the apartment and what was passing within what do you want said my father to some people who were holding a paper inscribed with characters of gold what we want replied one is to communicate to you the will of his highness do you see this firman i do said my father well read it he demands your head m my father answered with a loud laugh which was more frightful than even threats would have been and he had not ceased when two reports of a pistol were heard he had fired them himself and had killed two men the palikares who were prostrated at my fathers feet now sprang up and fired and the room was filled with fire and smoke at the same instant the firing began on the other side and the balls penetrated the boards all round us oh how noble did the grand vizier my father look at that moment in the midst of the flying bullets his scimitar in his hand and his face blackened with the powder of his enemies and how he terrified them even then and made them fly before him selim selim cried he guardian of the fire do your duty selim is dead replied a voice which seemed to come from the depths of the earth and you are lost ali at the same moment an explosion was heard and the flooring of the room in which my father was sitting was suddenly torn up and shivered to atoms the troops were firing from underneath three or four palikares fell with their bodies literally ploughed with wounds my father howled aloud plunged his fingers into the holes which the balls had made and tore up one of the planks entire but immediately through this opening twenty more shots were fired and the flame rushing up like fire from the crater of a volcano soon reached the tapestry which it quickly devoured in the midst of all this frightful tumult and these terrific cries two reports fearfully distinct followed by two shrieks more heartrending than all froze me with terror these two shots had mortally wounded my father and it was he who had given utterance to these frightful cries however he remained standing clinging to a window my mother tried to force the door that she might go and die with him but it was fastened on the inside all around him were lying the palikares writhing in convulsive agonies while two or three who were only slightly wounded were trying to escape by springing from the windows at this crisis the whole flooring suddenly gave way my father fell on one knee and at the same moment twenty hands were thrust forth
