listened with satisfaction to this tale of wounded self-love and defeated ambition but it seems to me said monte cristo and i must begin by asking your pardon for what i am about to say that if m noirtier disinherits mademoiselle de villefort because she is going to marry a man whose father he detested he cannot have the same cause of complaint against this dear edward true said madame de villefort with an intonation of voice which it is impossible to describe is it not unjust shamefully unjust poor edward is as much m noirtiers grandchild as valentine and yet if she had not been going to marry m franz m noirtier would have left her all his money and supposing valentine to be disinherited by her grandfather she will still be three times richer than he the count listened and said no more count said villefort we will not entertain you any longer with our family misfortunes it is true that my patrimony will go to endow charitable institutions and my father will have deprived me of my lawful inheritance without any reason for doing so but i shall have the satisfaction of knowing that i have acted like a man of sense and feeling m dpinay to whom i had promised the interest of this sum shall receive it even if i endure the most cruel privations however said madame de villefort returning to the one idea which incessantly occupied her mind perhaps it would be better to explain this unlucky affair to m dpinay in order to give him the opportunity of himself renouncing his claim to the hand of mademoiselle de villefort ah that would be a great pity said villefort a great pity said monte cristo undoubtedly said villefort moderating the tones of his voice a marriage once concerted and then broken off throws a sort of discredit on a young lady then again the old reports which i was so anxious to put an end to will instantly gain ground no it will all go well m dpinay if he is an honorable man will consider himself more than ever pledged to mademoiselle de villefort unless he were actuated by a decided feeling of avarice but that is impossible i agree with m de villefort said monte cristo fixing his eyes on madame de villefort and if i were sufficiently intimate with him to allow of giving my advice i would persuade him since i have been told m dpinay is coming back to settle this affair at once beyond all possibility of revocation i will answer for the success of a project which will reflect so much honor on m de villefort the procureur arose delighted with the proposition but his wife slightly changed color well that is all that i wanted and i will be guided by a counsellor such as you are said he extending his hand to monte cristo therefore let everyone here look upon what has passed today as if it had not happened and as though we had never thought of such a thing as a change in our original plans sir said the count the world unjust as it is will be pleased with your resolution your friends will be proud of you and m dpinay even if he took mademoiselle de villefort without any dowry which he will not do would be delighted with the idea of entering a family which could make such sacrifices in order to keep a promise and fulfil a duty at the conclusion of these words the count rose to depart are you going to leave us count said madame de villefort i am sorry to say i must do so madame i only came
