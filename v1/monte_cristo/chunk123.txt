nearly drowned attracted by his prepossessing appearance he renewed his offers of an engagement to dants but dants who had his own projects would not agree for a longer time than three months la jeune amlie had a very active crew very obedient to their captain who lost as little time as possible he had scarcely been a week at leghorn before the hold of his vessel was filled with printed muslins contraband cottons english powder and tobacco on which the excise had forgotten to put its mark the master was to get all this out of leghorn free of duties and land it on the shores of corsica where certain speculators undertook to forward the cargo to france they sailed edmond was again cleaving the azure sea which had been the first horizon of his youth and which he had so often dreamed of in prison he left gorgone on his right and la pianosa on his left and went towards the country of paoli and napoleon the next morning going on deck as he always did at an early hour the patron found dants leaning against the bulwarks gazing with intense earnestness at a pile of granite rocks which the rising sun tinged with rosy light it was the island of monte cristo la jeune amlie left it three-quarters of a league to the larboard and kept on for corsica dants thought as they passed so closely to the island whose name was so interesting to him that he had only to leap into the sea and in half an hour be at the promised land but then what could he do without instruments to discover his treasure without arms to defend himself besides what would the sailors say what would the patron think he must wait fortunately dants had learned how to wait he had waited fourteen years for his liberty and now he was free he could wait at least six months or a year for wealth would he not have accepted liberty without riches if it had been offered to him besides were not those riches chimerical offspring of the brain of the poor abb faria had they not died with him it is true the letter of the cardinal spada was singularly circumstantial and dants repeated it to himself from one end to the other for he had not forgotten a word m evening came and edmond saw the island tinged with the shades of twilight and then disappear in the darkness from all eyes but his own for he with vision accustomed to the gloom of a prison continued to behold it last of all for he remained alone upon deck the next morn broke off the coast of aleria all day they coasted and in the evening saw fires lighted on land the position of these was no doubt a signal for landing for a ships lantern was hung up at the mast-head instead of the streamer and they came to within a gunshot of the shore dants noticed that the captain of la jeune amlie had as he neared the land mounted two small culverins which without making much noise can throw a four ounce ball a thousand paces or so but on this occasion the precaution was superfluous and everything proceeded with the utmost smoothness and politeness four shallops came off with very little noise alongside the lugger which no doubt in acknowledgement of the compliment lowered her own shallop into the sea and the five boats worked so well that by two oclock in the morning all the cargo was out of la jeune amlie and on terra firma the same night such a man of regularity was the patron of la jeune amlie
