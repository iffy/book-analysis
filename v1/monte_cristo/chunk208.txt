lovely carmela awakened in the night by the light of the flames she sprang out of bed wrapped herself in a dressing-gown and attempted to escape by the door but the corridor by which she hoped to fly was already a prey to the flames she then returned to her room calling for help as loudly as she could when suddenly her window which was twenty feet from the ground was opened a young peasant jumped into the chamber seized her in his arms and with superhuman skill and strength conveyed her to the turf of the grass-plot where she fainted when she recovered her father was by her side all the servants surrounded her offering her assistance an entire wing of the villa was burnt down but what of that as long as carmela was safe and uninjured her preserver was everywhere sought for but he did not appear he was inquired after but no one had seen him carmela was greatly troubled that she had not recognized him as the count was immensely rich excepting the danger carmela had run and the marvellous manner in which she had escaped made that appear to him rather a favor of providence than a real misfortune the loss occasioned by the conflagration was to him but a trifle the next day at the usual hour the two young peasants were on the borders of the forest luigi arrived first he came toward teresa in high spirits and seemed to have completely forgotten the events of the previous evening the young girl was very pensive but seeing luigi so cheerful she on her part assumed a smiling air which was natural to her when she was not excited or in a passion luigi took her arm beneath his own and led her to the door of the grotto then he paused the young girl perceiving that there was something extraordinary looked at him steadfastly teresa said luigi yesterday evening you told me you would give all the world to have a costume similar to that of the counts daughter yes replied teresa with astonishment but i was mad to utter such a wish and i replied very well you shall have it yes replied the young girl whose astonishment increased at every word uttered by luigi but of course your reply was only to please me i have promised no more than i have given you teresa said luigi proudly go into the grotto and dress yourself at these words he drew away the stone and showed teresa the grotto lighted up by two wax lights which burnt on each side of a splendid mirror on a rustic table made by luigi were spread out the pearl necklace and the diamond pins and on a chair at the side was laid the rest of the costume teresa uttered a cry of joy and without inquiring whence this attire came or even thanking luigi darted into the grotto transformed into a dressing-room luigi pushed the stone behind her for on the crest of a small adjacent hill which cut off the view toward palestrina he saw a traveller on horseback stopping a moment as if uncertain of his road and thus presenting against the blue sky that perfect outline which is peculiar to distant objects in southern climes when he saw luigi he put his horse into a gallop and advanced toward him luigi was not mistaken the traveller who was going from palestrina to tivoli had mistaken his way the young man directed him but as at a distance of a quarter of a mile the road again divided into three ways and on reaching these the traveller might again stray from his route he begged luigi
