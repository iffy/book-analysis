mind was made up when the jailer moved his bed and stooped to examine the opening he would kill him with his water jug he would be condemned to die but he was about to die of grief and despair when this miraculous noise recalled him to life the jailer came in the evening dants was on his bed it seemed to him that thus he better guarded the unfinished opening doubtless there was a strange expression in his eyes for the jailer said come are you going mad again dants did not answer he feared that the emotion of his voice would betray him the jailer went away shaking his head night came dants hoped that his neighbor would profit by the silence to address him but he was mistaken the next morning however just as he removed his bed from the wall he heard three knocks he threw himself on his knees is it you said he i am here is your jailer gone yes said dants he will not return until the evening so that we have twelve hours before us i can work then said the voice oh yes yes this instant i entreat you in a moment that part of the floor on which dants was resting his two hands as he knelt with his head in the opening suddenly gave way he drew back smartly while a mass of stones and earth disappeared in a hole that opened beneath the aperture he himself had formed then from the bottom of this passage the depth of which it was impossible to measure he saw appear first the head then the shoulders and lastly the body of a man who sprang lightly into his cell m chapter a learned italian seizing in his arms the friend so long and ardently desired dants almost carried him towards the window in order to obtain a better view of his features by the aid of the imperfect light that struggled through the grating he was a man of small stature with hair blanched rather by suffering and sorrow than by age he had a deep-set penetrating eye almost buried beneath the thick gray eyebrow and a long and still black beard reaching down to his breast his thin face deeply furrowed by care and the bold outline of his strongly marked features betokened a man more accustomed to exercise his mental faculties than his physical strength large drops of perspiration were now standing on his brow while the garments that hung about him were so ragged that one could only guess at the pattern upon which they had originally been fashioned the stranger might have numbered sixty or sixty-five years but a certain briskness and appearance of vigor in his movements made it probable that he was aged more from captivity than the course of time he received the enthusiastic greeting of his young acquaintance with evident pleasure as though his chilled affections were rekindled and invigorated by his contact with one so warm and ardent he thanked him with grateful cordiality for his kindly welcome although he must at that moment have been suffering bitterly to find another dungeon where he had fondly reckoned on discovering a means of regaining his liberty let us first see said he whether it is possible to remove the traces of my entrance here our future tranquillity depends upon our jailers being entirely ignorant of it advancing to the opening he stooped and raised the stone easily in spite of its weight then fitting it into its place he said you removed this stone very carelessly but i suppose you had no tools to aid you why exclaimed dants with astonishment do you possess any i made
