with you in anything my friend said the count gather your strawberries if indeed there are any left i have ten left said the man for here are eleven and i had twenty-one five more than last year but i am not surprised the spring has been warm this year and strawberries require heat sir this is the reason that instead of the sixteen i had last year i have this year you see eleven already plucked twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen ah i miss three they were here last night sir i am sure they were here i counted them it must be the son of mre simon who has stolen them i saw him strolling about here this morning ah the young rascal stealing in a garden he does not know where that may lead him to certainly it is wrong said monte cristo but you should take into consideration the youth and greediness of the delinquent of course said the gardener but that does not make it the less unpleasant but sir once more i beg pardon perhaps you are an officer that i am detaining here and he glanced timidly at the counts blue coat m calm yourself my friend said the count with the smile which he made at will either terrible or benevolent and which now expressed only the kindliest feeling i am not an inspector but a traveller brought here by a curiosity he half repents of since he causes you to lose your time ah my time is not valuable replied the man with a melancholy smile still it belongs to government and i ought not to waste it but having received the signal that i might rest for an hour here he glanced at the sun-dial for there was everything in the enclosure of montlhry even a sun-dial and having ten minutes before me and my strawberries being ripe when a day longer by-the-by sir do you think dormice eat them indeed i should think not replied monte cristo dormice are bad neighbors for us who do not eat them preserved as the romans did what did the romans eat them said the gardener ate dormice i have read so in petronius said the count really they cant be nice though they do say as fat as a dormouse it is not a wonder they are fat sleeping all day and only waking to eat all night listen last year i had four apricots they stole one i had one nectarine only one well sir they ate half of it on the wall a splendid nectarine i never ate a better you ate it that is to say the half that was left you understand it was exquisite sir ah those gentlemen never choose the worst morsels like mre simons son who has not chosen the worst strawberries but this year continued the horticulturist ill take care it shall not happen even if i should be forced to sit by the whole night to watch when the strawberries are ripe monte cristo had seen enough every man has a devouring passion in his heart as every fruit has its worm that of the telegraph man was horticulture he began gathering the grape-leaves which screened the sun from the grapes and won the heart of the gardener did you come here sir to see the telegraph he said yes if it isnt contrary to the rules oh no said the gardener not in the least since there is no danger that anyone can possibly understand what we are saying i have been told said the count that you do not always yourselves understand the signals you repeat that is true sir and that is what
