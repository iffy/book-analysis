do not have any hope in him till they have exhausted all other means of deliverance dants asked to be removed from his present dungeon into another even if it were darker and deeper for a change however disadvantageous was still a change and would afford him some amusement he entreated to be allowed to walk about to have fresh air books and writing materials his requests were not granted but he went on asking all the same he accustomed himself to speaking to the new jailer although the latter was if possible more taciturn than the old one but still to speak to a man even though mute was something dants spoke for the sake of hearing his own voice he had tried to speak when alone but the sound of his voice terrified him often before his captivity dants mind had revolted at the idea of assemblages of prisoners made up of thieves vagabonds and murderers he now wished to be amongst them in order to see some other face besides that of his jailer he sighed for the galleys with the infamous costume the chain and the brand on the shoulder the galley-slaves breathed the fresh air of heaven and saw each other they were very happy he besought the jailer one day to let him have a companion were it even the mad abb the jailer though rough and hardened by the constant sight of so much suffering was yet a man at the bottom of his heart he had often had a feeling of pity for this unhappy young man who suffered so and he laid the request of number before the governor but the latter sapiently imagined that dants wished to conspire or attempt an escape and refused his request dants had exhausted all human resources and he then turned to god all the pious ideas that had been so long forgotten returned he recollected the prayers his mother had taught him and discovered a new meaning in every word for in prosperity prayers seem but a mere medley of words until misfortune comes and the unhappy sufferer first understands the meaning of the sublime language in which he invokes the pity of heaven he prayed and prayed aloud no longer terrified at the sound of his own voice for he fell into a sort of ecstasy he laid every action of his life before the almighty proposed tasks to accomplish and at the end of every prayer introduced the entreaty oftener addressed to man than to god forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us yet in spite of his earnest prayers dants remained a prisoner then gloom settled heavily upon him dants was a man of great simplicity of thought and without education he could not therefore in the solitude of his dungeon traverse in mental vision the history of the ages bring to life the nations that had perished and rebuild the ancient cities so vast and stupendous in the light of the imagination and that pass before the eye glowing with celestial colors in martins babylonian pictures he could not do this he whose past life was so short whose present so melancholy and his future so doubtful nineteen years of light to reflect upon in eternal darkness no distraction could come to his aid his energetic spirit that would have exalted in thus revisiting the past was imprisoned like an eagle in a cage he clung to one idea that of his happiness destroyed without apparent cause by an unheard-of fatality he considered and reconsidered this idea devoured it so to speak as the implacable ugolino devours the skull of archbishop roger in the inferno of dante rage supplanted religious
