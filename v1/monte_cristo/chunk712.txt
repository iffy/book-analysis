offers will you oppose them you well know edmond that i am no longer a reasoning creature i have no will unless it be the will never to decide i have been so overwhelmed by the many storms that have broken over my head that i am become passive in the hands of the almighty like a sparrow in the talons of an eagle i live because it is not ordained for me to die if succor be sent to me i will accept it ah madame said monte cristo you should not talk thus it is not so we should evince our resignation to the will of heaven on the contrary we are all free agents alas exclaimed mercds if it were so if i possessed free-will but without the power to render that will efficacious it would drive me to despair monte cristo dropped his head and shrank from the vehemence of her grief will you not even say you will see me again he asked on the contrary we shall meet again said mercds pointing to heaven with solemnity i tell you so to prove to you that i still hope and after pressing her own trembling hand upon that of the count mercds rushed up the stairs and disappeared monte cristo slowly left the house and turned towards the quay but mercds did not witness his departure although she was seated at the little window of the room which had been occupied by old dants her eyes were straining to see the ship which was carrying her son over the vast sea but still her voice involuntarily murmured softly edmond edmond edmond chapter the past the count departed with a sad heart from the house in which he had left mercds probably never to behold her again since the death of little edward a great change had taken place in monte cristo having reached the summit of his vengeance by a long and tortuous path he saw an abyss of doubt yawning before him more than this the conversation which had just taken place between mercds and himself had awakened so many recollections in his heart that he felt it necessary to combat with them a man of the counts temperament could not long indulge in that melancholy which can exist in common minds but which destroys superior ones he thought he must have made an error in his calculations if he now found cause to blame himself i cannot have deceived myself he said i must look upon the past in a false light what he continued can i have been following a false path can the end which i proposed be a mistaken end can one hour have sufficed to prove to an architect that the work upon which he founded all his hopes was an impossible if not a sacrilegious undertaking i cannot reconcile myself to this idea it would madden me the reason why i am now dissatisfied is that i have not a clear appreciation of the past the past like the country through which we walk becomes indistinct as we advance my position is like that of a person wounded in a dream he feels the wound though he cannot recollect when he received it come then thou regenerate man thou extravagant prodigal thou awakened sleeper thou all-powerful visionary thou invincible millionaire once again review thy past life of starvation and wretchedness revisit the scenes where fate and misfortune conducted and where despair received thee too many diamonds too much gold and splendor are now reflected by the mirror in which monte cristo seeks to behold dants hide thy diamonds bury thy gold shroud thy splendor exchange riches for poverty liberty for a prison
