the events which served as a subject of conversation for three-fourths of that city known as the capital of the world at the precise time when madame danglars dressed in black and concealed in a long veil was ascending the stairs leading to debrays apartments notwithstanding the assurances of the concierge that the young man was not at home debray was occupied in repelling the insinuations of a friend who tried to persuade him that after the terrible scene which had just taken place he ought as a friend of the family to marry mademoiselle danglars and her two millions debray did not defend himself very warmly for the idea had sometimes crossed his mind still when he recollected the independent proud spirit of eugnie he positively rejected it as utterly impossible though the same thought again continually recurred and found a resting-place in his heart tea play and the conversation which had become interesting during the discussion of such serious affairs lasted till one oclock in the morning meanwhile madame danglars veiled and uneasy awaited the return of debray in the little green room seated between two baskets of flowers which she had that morning sent and which it must be confessed debray had himself arranged and watered with so much care that his absence was half excused in the eyes of the poor woman at twenty minutes to twelve madame danglars tired of waiting returned home women of a certain grade are like prosperous grisettes in one respect they seldom return home after twelve oclock the baroness returned to the hotel with as much caution as eugnie used in leaving it she ran lightly upstairs and with an aching heart entered her apartment contiguous as we know to that of eugnie she was fearful of exciting any remark and believed firmly in her daughters innocence and fidelity to the paternal roof she listened at eugnies door and hearing no sound tried to enter but the bolts were in place madame danglars then concluded that the young girl had been overcome with the terrible excitement of the evening and had gone to bed and to sleep she called the maid and questioned her mademoiselle eugnie said the maid retired to her apartment with mademoiselle darmilly they then took tea together after which they desired me to leave saying that they needed me no longer since then the maid had been below and like everyone else she thought the young ladies were in their own room madame danglars therefore went to bed without a shadow of suspicion and began to muse over the recent events in proportion as her memory became clearer the occurrences of the evening were revealed in their true light what she had taken for confusion was a tumult what she had regarded as something distressing was in reality a disgrace and then the baroness remembered that she had felt no pity for poor mercds who had been afflicted with as severe a blow through her husband and son eugnie she said to herself is lost and so are we the affair as it will be reported will cover us with shame for in a society such as ours satire inflicts a painful and incurable wound how fortunate that eugnie is possessed of that strange character which has so often made me tremble and her glance was turned towards heaven where a mysterious providence disposes all things and out of a fault nay even a vice sometimes produces a blessing and then her thoughts cleaving through space like a bird in the air rested on cavalcanti this andrea was a wretch a robber an assassin and yet his manners showed the effects of a sort of education if not a complete one
