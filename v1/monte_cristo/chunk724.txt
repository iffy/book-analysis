were hollowed out in sepulchres one above the other and which seemed in contrast with the white stones to open their large dark eyes like those which we see on the faces of the dead a sentinel struck the rings of his carbine against his left hand who comes there he cried a friend a friend said peppino but where is the captain there said the sentinel pointing over his shoulder to a spacious crypt hollowed out of the rock the lights from which shone into the passage through the large arched openings fine spoil captain fine spoil said peppino in italian and taking danglars by the collar of his coat he dragged him to an opening resembling a door through which they entered the apartment which the captain appeared to have made his dwelling-place is this the man asked the captain who was attentively reading plutarchs life of alexander himself captain himself very well show him to me at this rather impertinent order peppino raised his torch to the face of danglars who hastily withdrew that he might not have his eyelashes burnt his agitated features presented the appearance of pale and hideous terror the man is tired said the captain conduct him to his bed oh murmured danglars that bed is probably one of the coffins hollowed in the wall and the sleep i shall enjoy will be death from one of the poniards i see glistening in the darkness from their beds of dried leaves or wolf-skins at the back of the chamber now arose the companions of the man who had been found by albert de morcerf reading csars commentaries and by danglars studying the life of alexander the banker uttered a groan and followed his guide he neither supplicated nor exclaimed he no longer possessed strength will power or feeling he followed where they led him at length he found himself at the foot of a staircase and he mechanically lifted his foot five or six times then a low door was opened before him and bending his head to avoid striking his forehead he entered a small room cut out of the rock the cell was clean though empty and dry though situated at an immeasurable distance under the earth a bed of dried grass covered with goat-skins was placed in one corner danglars brightened up on beholding it fancying that it gave some promise of safety oh god be praised he said it is a real bed this was the second time within the hour that he had invoked the name of god he had not done so for ten years before ecco said the guide and pushing danglars into the cell he closed the door upon him a bolt grated and danglars was a prisoner if there had been no bolt it would have been impossible for him to pass through the midst of the garrison who held the catacombs of st sebastian encamped round a master whom our readers must have recognized as the famous luigi vampa danglars too had recognized the bandit whose existence he would not believe when albert de morcerf mentioned him in paris and not only did he recognize him but the cell in which albert had been confined and which was probably kept for the accommodation of strangers these recollections were dwelt upon with some pleasure by danglars and restored him to some degree of tranquillity since the bandits had not despatched him at once he felt that they would not kill him at all they had arrested him for the purpose of robbery and as he had only a few louis about him he doubted not he would be ransomed he remembered that morcerf had been taxed at crowns
