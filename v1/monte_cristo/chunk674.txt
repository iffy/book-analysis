there at half-past three in the winter the fire was lighted by the discreet servant who had the superintendence of the little apartment and in the summer ices were placed on the table at the same hour at four oclock as we have already stated the mysterious personage arrived twenty minutes afterwards a carriage stopped at the house a lady alighted in a black or dark blue dress and always thickly veiled she passed like a shadow through the lodge and ran upstairs without a sound escaping under the touch of her light foot no one ever asked her where she was going her face therefore like that of the gentleman was perfectly unknown to the two concierges who were perhaps unequalled throughout the capital for discretion we need not say she stopped at the first floor then she tapped in a peculiar manner at a door which after being opened to admit her was again fastened and curiosity penetrated no farther they used the same precautions in leaving as in entering the house the lady always left first and as soon as she had stepped into her carriage it drove away sometimes towards the right hand sometimes to the left then about twenty minutes afterwards the gentleman would also leave buried in his cravat or concealed by his handkerchief the day after monte cristo had called upon danglars the mysterious lodger entered at ten oclock in the morning instead of four in the afternoon almost directly afterwards without the usual interval of time a cab arrived and the veiled lady ran hastily upstairs the door opened but before it could be closed the lady exclaimed oh lucien oh my friend the concierge therefore heard for the first time that the lodgers name was lucien still as he was the very perfection of a door-keeper he made up his mind not to tell his wife well what is the matter my dear asked the gentleman whose name the ladys agitation revealed tell me what is the matter oh lucien can i confide in you of course you know you can do so but what can be the matter your note of this morning has completely bewildered me this precipitation this unusual appointment come ease me of my anxiety or else frighten me at once lucien a great event has happened said the lady glancing inquiringly at lucien m danglars left last night left m danglars left where has he gone i do not know what do you mean has he gone intending not to return undoubtedly at ten oclock at night his horses took him to the barrier of charenton there a post-chaise was waiting for him he entered it with his valet de chambre saying that he was going to fontainebleau then what did you mean stay he left a letter for me a letter yes read it and the baroness took from her pocket a letter which she gave to debray debray paused a moment before reading as if trying to guess its contents or perhaps while making up his mind how to act whatever it might contain no doubt his ideas were arranged in a few minutes for he began reading the letter which caused so much uneasiness in the heart of the baroness and which ran as follows madame and most faithful wife debray mechanically stopped and looked at the baroness whose face became covered with blushes read she said debray continued when you receive this you will no longer have a husband oh you need not be alarmed you will only have lost him as you have lost your daughter i mean that i shall be travelling on one of the thirty or forty roads leading out of france
