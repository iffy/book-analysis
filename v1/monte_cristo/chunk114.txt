disturbance and dants knew that he had escaped the first peril it was a good augury at length about the hour the governor had appointed footsteps were heard on the stairs edmond felt that the moment had arrived summoned up all his courage held his breath and would have been happy if at the same time he could have repressed the throbbing of his veins the footsteps they were double paused at the door and dants guessed that the two grave-diggers had come to seek him this idea was soon converted into certainty when he heard the noise they made in putting down the hand-bier the door opened and a dim light reached dants eyes through the coarse sack that covered him he saw two shadows approach his bed a third remaining at the door with a torch in its hand the two men approaching the ends of the bed took the sack by its extremities hes heavy though for an old and thin man said one as he raised the head they say every year adds half a pound to the weight of the bones said another lifting the feet have you tied the knot inquired the first speaker what would be the use of carrying so much more weight was the reply i can do that when we get there yes youre right replied the companion whats the knot for thought dants they deposited the supposed corpse on the bier edmond stiffened himself in order to play the part of a dead man and then the party lighted by the man with the torch who went first ascended the stairs suddenly he felt the fresh and sharp night air and dants knew that the mistral was blowing it was a sensation in which pleasure and pain were strangely mingled the bearers went on for twenty paces then stopped putting the bier down on the ground one of them went away and dants heard his shoes striking on the pavement where am i he asked himself really he is by no means a light load said the other bearer sitting on the edge of the hand-barrow dants first impulse was to escape but fortunately he did not attempt it give us a light said the other bearer or i shall never find what i am looking for the man with the torch complied although not asked in the most polite terms what can he be looking for thought edmond the spade perhaps an exclamation of satisfaction indicated that the grave-digger had found the object of his search here it is at last he said not without some trouble though yes was the answer but it has lost nothing by waiting as he said this the man came towards edmond who heard a heavy metallic substance laid down beside him and at the same moment a cord was fastened round his feet with sudden and painful violence well have you tied the knot inquired the grave-digger who was looking on yes and pretty tight too i can tell you was the answer move on then and the bier was lifted once more and they proceeded they advanced fifty paces farther and then stopped to open a door then went forward again the noise of the waves dashing against the rocks on which the chteau is built reached dants ear distinctly as they went forward bad weather observed one of the bearers not a pleasant night for a dip in the sea why yes the abb runs a chance of being wet said the other and then there was a burst of brutal laughter dants did not comprehend the jest but his hair stood erect on his head well here we are at last said one
