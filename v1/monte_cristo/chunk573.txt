thunderstruck who then has so correctly informed you asked he for my paper which gave the first information on the subject has been obliged to stop for want of proof and yet we are more interested than you in exposing m de morcerf as he is a peer of france and we are of the opposition oh that is very simple we have not sought to scandalize this news was brought to us a man arrived yesterday from yanina bringing a formidable array of documents and when we hesitated to publish the accusatory article he told us it should be inserted in some other paper beauchamp understood that nothing remained but to submit and left the office to despatch a courier to morcerf but he had been unable to send to albert the following particulars as the events had transpired after the messengers departure namely that the same day a great agitation was manifest in the house of peers among the usually calm members of that dignified assembly everyone had arrived almost before the usual hour and was conversing on the melancholy event which was to attract the attention of the public towards one of their most illustrious colleagues some were perusing the article others making comments and recalling circumstances which substantiated the charges still more the count of morcerf was no favorite with his colleagues like all upstarts he had had recourse to a great deal of haughtiness to maintain his position the true nobility laughed at him the talented repelled him and the honorable instinctively despised him he was in fact in the unhappy position of the victim marked for sacrifice the finger of god once pointed at him everyone was prepared to raise the hue and cry the count of morcerf alone was ignorant of the news he did not take in the paper containing the defamatory article and had passed the morning in writing letters and in trying a horse he arrived at his usual hour with a proud look and insolent demeanor he alighted passed through the corridors and entered the house without observing the hesitation of the door-keepers or the coolness of his colleagues m business had already been going on for half an hour when he entered everyone held the accusing paper but as usual no one liked to take upon himself the responsibility of the attack at length an honorable peer morcerfs acknowledged enemy ascended the tribune with that solemnity which announced that the expected moment had arrived there was an impressive silence morcerf alone knew not why such profound attention was given to an orator who was not always listened to with so much complacency the count did not notice the introduction in which the speaker announced that his communication would be of that vital importance that it demanded the undivided attention of the house but at the mention of yanina and colonel fernand he turned so frightfully pale that every member shuddered and fixed his eyes upon him moral wounds have this peculiarity they may be hidden but they never close always painful always ready to bleed when touched they remain fresh and open in the heart the article having been read during the painful hush that followed a universal shudder pervaded the assembly and immediately the closest attention was given to the orator as he resumed his remarks he stated his scruples and the difficulties of the case it was the honor of m de morcerf and that of the whole house he proposed to defend by provoking a debate on personal questions which are always such painful themes of discussion he concluded by calling for an investigation which might dispose of the calumnious report before it had time to spread and restore m
