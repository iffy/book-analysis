see the father so absorbed in his professional duties which were the only means he had of dissipating his grief once only had villefort seen his father it was the day after that upon which bertuccio had paid his second visit to benedetto when the latter was to learn his fathers name the magistrate harassed and fatigued had descended to the garden of his house and in a gloomy mood similar to that in which tarquin lopped off the tallest poppies he began knocking off with his cane the long and dying branches of the rose-trees which placed along the avenue seemed like the spectres of the brilliant flowers which had bloomed in the past season more than once he had reached that part of the garden where the famous boarded gate stood overlooking the deserted enclosure always returning by the same path to begin his walk again at the same pace and with the same gesture when he accidentally turned his eyes towards the house whence he heard the noisy play of his son who had returned from school to spend the sunday and monday with his mother while doing so he observed m noirtier at one of the open windows where the old man had been placed that he might enjoy the last rays of the sun which yet yielded some heat and was now shining upon the dying flowers and red leaves of the creeper which twined around the balcony the eye of the old man was riveted upon a spot which villefort could scarcely distinguish his glance was so full of hate of ferocity and savage impatience that villefort turned out of the path he had been pursuing to see upon what person this dark look was directed then he saw beneath a thick clump of linden-trees which were nearly divested of foliage madame de villefort sitting with a book in her hand the perusal of which she frequently interrupted to smile upon her son or to throw back his elastic ball which he obstinately threw from the drawing-room into the garden villefort became pale he understood the old mans meaning noirtier continued to look at the same object but suddenly his glance was transferred from the wife to the husband and villefort himself had to submit to the searching investigation of eyes which while changing their direction and even their language had lost none of their menacing expression madame de villefort unconscious of the passions that exhausted their fire over her head at that moment held her sons ball and was making signs to him to reclaim it with a kiss edward begged for a long while the maternal kiss probably not offering sufficient recompense for the trouble he must take to obtain it however at length he decided leaped out of the window into a cluster of heliotropes and daisies and ran to his mother his forehead streaming with perspiration madame de villefort wiped his forehead pressed her lips upon it and sent him back with the ball in one hand and some bonbons in the other villefort drawn by an irresistible attraction like that of the bird to the serpent walked towards the house as he approached it noirtiers gaze followed him and his eyes appeared of such a fiery brightness that villefort felt them pierce to the depths of his heart in that earnest look might be read a deep reproach as well as a terrible menace then noirtier raised his eyes to heaven as though to remind his son of a forgotten oath it is well sir replied villefort from below it is well have patience but one day longer what i have said i will do noirtier seemed to be calmed by these words
