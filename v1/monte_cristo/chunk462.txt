with the son in the timber-yards but whence does he derive the title of count you are aware that may be bought in italy everywhere and his immense riches whence does he procure them they may not be so very great how much do you suppose he possesses from one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand livres per annum that is reasonable said the visitor i have heard he had three or four millions two hundred thousand per annum would make four millions of capital but i was told he had four millions per annum that is not probable do you know this island of monte cristo certainly everyone who has come from palermo naples or rome to france by sea must know it since he has passed close to it and must have seen it i am told it is a delightful place it is a rock and why has the count bought a rock for the sake of being a count in italy one must have territorial possessions to be a count you have doubtless heard the adventures of m zaccones youth the fathers no the sons i know nothing certain at that period of his life i lost sight of my young comrade was he in the wars i think he entered the service in what branch in the navy are you not his confessor no sir i believe he is a lutheran a lutheran i say i believe such is the case i do not affirm it besides liberty of conscience is established in france doubtless and we are not now inquiring into his creed but his actions in the name of the prefect of police i ask you what you know of him he passes for a very charitable man our holy father the pope has made him a knight of jesus christ for the services he rendered to the christians in the east he has five or six rings as testimonials from eastern monarchs of his services does he wear them no but he is proud of them he is better pleased with rewards given to the benefactors of man than to his destroyers he is a quaker then exactly he is a quaker with the exception of the peculiar dress has he any friends yes everyone who knows him is his friend but has he any enemies one only what is his name lord wilmore where is he he is in paris just now can he give me any particulars important ones he was in india with zaccone do you know his abode its somewhere in the chausse dantin but i know neither the street nor the number m are you at variance with the englishman i love zaccone and he hates him we are consequently not friends do you think the count of monte cristo had ever been in france before he made this visit to paris to that question i can answer positively no sir he had not because he applied to me six months ago for the particulars he required and as i did not know when i might again come to paris i recommended m cavalcanti to him andrea no bartolomeo his father now sir i have but one question more to ask and i charge you in the name of honor of humanity and of religion to answer me candidly what is it sir do you know with what design m de monte cristo purchased a house at auteuil certainly for he told me what is it sir to make a lunatic asylum of it similar to that founded by the count of pisani at palermo do you know about that institution i have heard of it it is a magnificent charity
