art rendered the commonest metals precious dants seized the handles and strove to lift the coffer it was impossible he sought to open it lock and padlock were fastened these faithful guardians seemed unwilling to surrender their trust dants inserted the sharp end of the pickaxe between the coffer and the lid and pressing with all his force on the handle burst open the fastenings the hinges yielded in their turn and fell still holding in their grasp fragments of the wood and the chest was open m edmond was seized with vertigo he cocked his gun and laid it beside him he then closed his eyes as children do in order that they may see in the resplendent night of their own imagination more stars than are visible in the firmament then he re-opened them and stood motionless with amazement three compartments divided the coffer in the first blazed piles of golden coin in the second were ranged bars of unpolished gold which possessed nothing attractive save their value in the third edmond grasped handfuls of diamonds pearls and rubies which as they fell on one another sounded like hail against glass after having touched felt examined these treasures edmond rushed through the caverns like a man seized with frenzy he leaped on a rock from whence he could behold the sea he was alone alone with these countless these unheard-of treasures was he awake or was it but a dream was it a transient vision or was he face to face with reality he would fain have gazed upon his gold and yet he had not strength enough for an instant he leaned his head in his hands as if to prevent his senses from leaving him and then rushed madly about the rocks of monte cristo terrifying the wild goats and scaring the sea-fowls with his wild cries and gestures then he returned and still unable to believe the evidence of his senses rushed into the grotto and found himself before this mine of gold and jewels this time he fell on his knees and clasping his hands convulsively uttered a prayer intelligible to god alone he soon became calmer and more happy for only now did he begin to realize his felicity he then set himself to work to count his fortune there were a thousand ingots of gold each weighing from two to three pounds then he piled up twenty-five thousand crowns each worth about eighty francs of our money and bearing the effigies of alexander vi and his predecessors and he saw that the complement was not half empty and he measured ten double handfuls of pearls diamonds and other gems many of which mounted by the most famous workmen were valuable beyond their intrinsic worth dants saw the light gradually disappear and fearing to be surprised in the cavern left it his gun in his hand a piece of biscuit and a small quantity of rum formed his supper and he snatched a few hours sleep lying over the mouth of the cave it was a night of joy and terror such as this man of stupendous emotions had already experienced twice or thrice in his lifetime chapter the unknown day for which dants had so eagerly and impatiently waited with open eyes again dawned with the first light dants resumed his search again he climbed the rocky height he had ascended the previous evening and strained his view to catch every peculiarity of the landscape but it wore the same wild barren aspect when seen by the rays of the morning sun which it had done when surveyed by the fading glimmer of eve descending into the grotto he lifted the stone filled his pockets with gems
