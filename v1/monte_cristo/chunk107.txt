free so fills my whole existence that the despair to which i was just on the point of yielding when i knew you has no longer any hold over me and this this is my fortune not chimerical but actual i owe you my real good my present happiness and all the sovereigns of the earth even csar borgia himself could not deprive me of this thus if not actually happy yet the days these two unfortunates passed together went quickly faria who for so long a time had kept silence as to the treasure now perpetually talked of it as he had prophesied would be the case he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left leg and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself but he was continually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion and anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy for fear the letter might be some day lost or stolen he compelled dants to learn it by heart and dants knew it from the first to the last word then he destroyed the second portion assured that if the first were seized no one would be able to discover its real meaning whole hours sometimes passed while faria was giving instructions to dants instructions which were to serve him when he was at liberty then once free from the day and hour and moment when he was so he could have but one only thought which was to gain monte cristo by some means and remain there alone under some pretext which would arouse no suspicions and once there to endeavor to find the wonderful caverns and search in the appointed spot the appointed spot be it remembered being the farthest angle in the second opening in the meanwhile the hours passed if not rapidly at least tolerably faria as we have said without having recovered the use of his hand and foot had regained all the clearness of his understanding and had gradually besides the moral instructions we have detailed taught his youthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner who learns to make something from nothing they were thus perpetually employed faria that he might not see himself grow old dants for fear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his memory like a distant light wandering in the night so life went on for them as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose activities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of providence but beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young man and perhaps in that of the old man many repressed desires many stifled sighs which found vent when faria was left alone and when edmond returned to his cell one night edmond awoke suddenly believing that he heard someone calling him he opened his eyes upon utter darkness his name or rather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name reached him he sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow undoubtedly the call came from farias dungeon alas murmured edmond can it be he moved his bed drew up the stone rushed into the passage and reached the opposite extremity the secret entrance was open by the light of the wretched and wavering lamp of which we have spoken dants saw the old man pale but yet erect clinging to the bedstead his features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he already knew and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them for the first time alas my dear friend said faria in a resigned tone you understand do you not
