done the guilty deed i fancied that i still heard faint moans and imagining that the unfortunate jeweller might not be quite dead i determined to go to his relief by way of atoning in some slight degree not for the crime i had committed but for that which i had not endeavored to prevent for this purpose i applied all the strength i possessed to force an entrance from the cramped spot in which i lay to the adjoining room the poorly fastened boards which alone divided me from it yielded to my efforts and i found myself in the house hastily snatching up the lighted candle i hurried to the staircase about midway a body was lying quite across the stairs it was that of la carconte the pistol i had heard had doubtless been fired at her the shot had frightfully lacerated her throat leaving two gaping wounds from which as well as the mouth the blood was pouring in floods she was stone dead i strode past her and ascended to the sleeping chamber which presented an appearance of the wildest disorder the furniture had been knocked over in the deadly struggle that had taken place there and the sheets to which the unfortunate jeweller had doubtless clung were dragged across the room the murdered man lay on the floor his head leaning against the wall and about him was a pool of blood which poured forth from three large wounds in his breast there was a fourth gash in which a long table knife was plunged up to the handle i stumbled over some object i stooped to examine it was the second pistol which had not gone off probably from the powder being wet i approached the jeweller who was not quite dead and at the sound of my footsteps and the creaking of the floor he opened his eyes fixed them on me with an anxious and inquiring gaze moved his lips as though trying to speak then overcome by the effort fell back and expired this appalling sight almost bereft me of my senses and finding that i could no longer be of service to anyone in the house my only desire was to fly i rushed towards the staircase clutching my hair and uttering a groan of horror upon reaching the room below i found five or six custom-house officers and two or three gendarmes all heavily armed they threw themselves upon me i made no resistance i was no longer master of my senses when i strove to speak a few inarticulate sounds alone escaped my lips as i noticed the significant manner in which the whole party pointed to my blood-stained garments i involuntarily surveyed myself and then i discovered that the thick warm drops that had so bedewed me as i lay beneath the staircase must have been the blood of la carconte i pointed to the spot where i had concealed myself what does he mean asked a gendarme one of the officers went to the place i directed he means replied the man upon his return that he got in that way and he showed the hole i had made when i broke through then i saw that they took me for the assassin i recovered force and energy enough to free myself from the hands of those who held me while i managed to stammer forth i did not do it indeed indeed i did not a couple of gendarmes held the muzzles of their carbines against my breast stir but a step said they and you are a dead man why should you threaten me with death cried i when i have already declared my innocence tush tush cried
