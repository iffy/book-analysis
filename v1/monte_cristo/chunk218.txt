a box at the teatro argentina and franz having a number of letters to write relinquished the carriage to albert for the whole of the day at five oclock albert returned delighted with his days work he had been occupied in leaving his letters of introduction and had received in return more invitations to balls and routs than it would be possible for him to accept besides this he had seen as he called it all the remarkable sights at rome yes in a single day he had accomplished what his more serious-minded companion would have taken weeks to effect neither had he neglected to ascertain the name of the piece to be played that night at the teatro argentina and also what performers appeared in it the opera of parisina was announced for representation and the principal actors were coselli moriani and la specchia the young men therefore had reason to consider themselves fortunate in having the opportunity of hearing one of the best works by the composer of lucia di lammermoor supported by three of the most renowned vocalists of italy albert had never been able to endure the italian theatres with their orchestras from which it is impossible to see and the absence of balconies or open boxes all these defects pressed hard on a man who had had his stall at the bouffes and had shared a lower box at the opera still in spite of this albert displayed his most dazzling and effective costumes each time he visited the theatres but alas his elegant toilet was wholly thrown away and one of the most worthy representatives of parisian fashion had to carry with him the mortifying reflection that he had nearly overrun italy without meeting with a single adventure sometimes albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success but internally he was deeply wounded and his self-love immensely piqued to think that albert de morcerf the most admired and most sought after of any young person of his day should thus be passed over and merely have his labor for his pains and the thing was so much the more annoying as according to the characteristic modesty of a frenchman albert had quitted paris with the full conviction that he had only to show himself in italy to carry all before him and that upon his return he should astonish the parisian world with the recital of his numerous love-affairs alas poor albert none of those interesting adventures fell in his way the lovely genoese florentines and neapolitans were all faithful if not to their husbands at least to their lovers and thought not of changing even for the splendid appearance of albert de morcerf and all he gained was the painful conviction that the ladies of italy have this advantage over those of france that they are faithful even in their infidelity yet he could not restrain a hope that in italy as elsewhere there might be an exception to the general rule albert besides being an elegant well-looking young man was also possessed of considerable talent and ability moreover he was a viscount a recently created one certainly but in the present day it is not necessary to go as far back as noah in tracing a descent and a genealogical tree is equally estimated whether dated from or merely but to crown all these advantages albert de morcerf commanded an income of livres a more than sufficient sum to render him a personage of considerable importance in paris it was therefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the principal cities in italy without having excited the most trifling observation albert however hoped to indemnify himself for all these slights
