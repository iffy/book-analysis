he had brought but a hundred louis and of these he had not more than fifty left thus seven or eight hundred piastres were wanting to them both to make up the sum that albert required true he might in such a case rely on the kindness of signor torlonia he was therefore about to return to the palazzo bracciano without loss of time when suddenly a luminous idea crossed his mind he remembered the count of monte cristo franz was about to ring for signor pastrini when that worthy presented himself my dear sir he said hastily do you know if the count is within yes your excellency he has this moment returned is he in bed i should say no then ring at his door if you please and request him to be so kind as to give me an audience signor pastrini did as he was desired and returning five minutes after he said the count awaits your excellency franz went along the corridor and a servant introduced him to the count he was in a small room which franz had not yet seen and which was surrounded with divans the count came towards him well what good wind blows you hither at this hour said he have you come to sup with me it would be very kind of you no i have come to speak to you of a very serious matter a serious matter said the count looking at franz with the earnestness usual to him and what may it be are we alone yes replied the count going to the door and returning franz gave him alberts letter read that he said the count read it well well said he did you see the postscript i did indeed se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani alla sette il conte alberto avr cessato di vivere luigi vampa what think you of that inquired franz have you the money he demands yes all but eight hundred piastres the count went to his secrtaire opened it and pulling out a drawer filled with gold said to franz i hope you will not offend me by applying to anyone but myself you see on the contrary i come to you first and instantly replied franz and i thank you have what you will and he made a sign to franz to take what he pleased is it absolutely necessary then to send the money to luigi vampa asked the young man looking fixedly in his turn at the count judge for yourself replied he the postscript is explicit i think that if you would take the trouble of reflecting you could find a way of simplifying the negotiation said franz how so returned the count with surprise if we were to go together to luigi vampa i am sure he would not refuse you alberts freedom what influence can i possibly have over a bandit have you not just rendered him a service that can never be forgotten what is that have you not saved peppinos life well well said the count who told you that no matter i know it the count knit his brows and remained silent an instant and if i went to seek vampa would you accompany me if my society would not be disagreeable be it so it is a lovely night and a walk without rome will do us both good shall i take any arms for what purpose any money it is useless where is the man who brought the letter in the street he awaits the answer yes i must learn where we are going i will summon him hither it is useless he would not come
