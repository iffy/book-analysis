turn then advanced along the same path which at the distance of a hundred paces led them over a declivity to the bottom of a small valley they then perceived two men conversing in the obscurity ought we to go on asked franz of the count or should we pause let us go on peppino will have warned the sentry of our coming one of the two men was peppino and the other a bandit on the lookout franz and the count advanced and the bandit saluted them your excellency said peppino addressing the count if you will follow me the opening of the catacombs is close at hand go on then replied the count they came to an opening behind a clump of bushes and in the midst of a pile of rocks by which a man could scarcely pass peppino glided first into this crevice after they got along a few paces the passage widened peppino passed lighted his torch and turned to see if they came after him the count first reached an open space and franz followed him closely the passageway sloped in a gentle descent enlarging as they proceeded still franz and the count were compelled to advance in a stooping posture and were scarcely able to proceed abreast of one another they went on a hundred and fifty paces in this way and then were stopped by who comes there at the same time they saw the reflection of a torch on a carbine barrel a friend responded peppino and advancing alone towards the sentry he said a few words to him in a low tone and then he like the first saluted the nocturnal visitors making a sign that they might proceed behind the sentinel was a staircase with twenty steps franz and the count descended these and found themselves in a mortuary chamber five corridors diverged like the rays of a star and the walls dug into niches which were arranged one above the other in the shape of coffins showed that they were at last in the catacombs down one of the corridors whose extent it was impossible to determine rays of light were visible the count laid his hand on franzs shoulder would you like to see a camp of bandits in repose he inquired exceedingly replied franz come with me then peppino put out the torch peppino obeyed and franz and the count were in utter darkness except that fifty paces in advance of them a reddish glare more evident since peppino had put out his torch was visible along the wall they advanced silently the count guiding franz as if he had the singular faculty of seeing in the dark franz himself however saw his way more plainly in proportion as he went on towards the light which served in some manner as a guide three arcades were before them and the middle one was used as a door these arcades opened on one side into the corridor where the count and franz were and on the other into a large square chamber entirely surrounded by niches similar to those of which we have spoken in the midst of this chamber were four stones which had formerly served as an altar as was evident from the cross which still surmounted them a lamp placed at the base of a pillar lighted up with its pale and flickering flame the singular scene which presented itself to the eyes of the two visitors concealed in the shadow a man was seated with his elbow leaning on the column and was reading with his back turned to the arcades through the openings of which the new-comers contemplated him this was the chief of the band luigi
