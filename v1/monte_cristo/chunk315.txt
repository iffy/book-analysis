are my judge on earth as the almighty is in heaven have you for me no words of consolation my good friend i can only repeat the words addressed to you by the abb busoni villefort merited punishment for what he had done to you and perhaps to others benedetto if still living will become the instrument of divine retribution in some way or other and then be duly punished in his turn as far as you yourself are concerned i see but one point in which you are really guilty ask yourself wherefore after rescuing the infant from its living grave you did not restore it to its mother there was the crime bertuccio that was where you became really culpable true excellency that was the crime the real crime for in that i acted like a coward my first duty directly i had succeeded in recalling the babe to life was to restore it to its mother but in order to do so i must have made close and careful inquiry which would in all probability have led to my own apprehension and i clung to life partly on my sisters account and partly from that feeling of pride inborn in our hearts of desiring to come off untouched and victorious in the execution of our vengeance perhaps too the natural and instinctive love of life made me wish to avoid endangering my own and then again i am not as brave and courageous as was my poor brother bertuccio hid his face in his hands as he uttered these words while monte cristo fixed on him a look of inscrutable meaning after a brief silence rendered still more solemn by the time and place the count said in a tone of melancholy wholly unlike his usual manner in order to bring this conversation to a fitting termination the last we shall ever hold upon this subject i will repeat to you some words i have heard from the lips of the abb busoni for all evils there are two remedies time and silence and now leave me monsieur bertuccio to walk alone here in the garden the very circumstances which inflict on you as a principal in the tragic scene enacted here such painful emotions are to me on the contrary a source of something like contentment and serve but to enhance the value of this dwelling in my estimation the chief beauty of trees consists in the deep shadow of their umbrageous boughs while fancy pictures a moving multitude of shapes and forms flitting and passing beneath that shade here i have a garden laid out in such a way as to afford the fullest scope for the imagination and furnished with thickly grown trees beneath whose leafy screen a visionary like myself may conjure up phantoms at will this to me who expected but to find a blank enclosure surrounded by a straight wall is i assure you a most agreeable surprise i have no fear of ghosts and i have never heard it said that so much harm had been done by the dead during six thousand years as is wrought by the living in a single day retire within bertuccio and tranquillize your mind should your confessor be less indulgent to you in your dying moments than you found the abb busoni send for me if i am still on earth and i will soothe your ears with words that shall effectually calm and soothe your parting soul ere it goes forth to traverse the ocean called eternity bertuccio bowed respectfully and turned away sighing heavily monte cristo left alone took three or four steps onwards and murmured here beneath this plane-tree must have been where the infants
