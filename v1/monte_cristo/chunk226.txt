robert it would add greatly to the effect if the countess would join us in the costume of a peasant from puzzoli or sorrento our group would then be quite complete more especially as the countess is quite beautiful enough to represent a madonna well said franz this time m albert i am bound to give you credit for having hit upon a most capital idea and quite a national one too replied albert with gratified pride a mere masque borrowed from our own festivities ha ha ye romans you thought to make us unhappy strangers trot at the heels of your processions like so many lazzaroni because no carriages or horses are to be had in your beggarly city but you dont know us when we cant have one thing we invent another and have you communicated your triumphant idea to anybody only to our host upon my return home i sent for him and i then explained to him what i wished to procure he assured me that nothing would be easier than to furnish all i desired one thing i was sorry for when i bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded he told me there would not be time as it would require three days to do that so you see we must do without this little superfluity and where is he now who our host gone out in search of our equipage by tomorrow it might be too late then he will be able to give us an answer tonight oh i expect him every minute at this instant the door opened and the head of signor pastrini appeared permesso inquired he certainly certainly cried franz come in my host now then asked albert eagerly have you found the desired cart and oxen better than that replied signor pastrini with the air of a man perfectly well satisfied with himself take care my worthy host said albert better is a sure enemy to well let your excellencies only leave the matter to me returned signor pastrini in a tone indicative of unbounded self-confidence but what have you done asked franz speak out theres a worthy fellow your excellencies are aware responded the landlord swelling with importance that the count of monte cristo is living on the same floor with yourselves i should think we did know it exclaimed albert since it is owing to that circumstance that we are packed into these small rooms like two poor students in the back streets of paris when then the count of monte cristo hearing of the dilemma in which you are placed has sent to offer you seats in his carriage and two places at his windows in the palazzo rospoli the friends looked at each other with unutterable surprise but do you think asked albert that we ought to accept such offers from a perfect stranger what sort of person is this count of monte cristo asked franz of his host a very great nobleman but whether maltese or sicilian i cannot exactly say but this i know that he is noble as a borghese and rich as a gold mine it seems to me said franz speaking in an undertone to albert that if this person merited the high panegyrics of our landlord he would have conveyed his invitation through another channel and not permitted it to be brought to us in this unceremonious way he would have written or at this instant someone knocked at the door come in said franz a servant wearing a livery of considerable style and richness appeared at the threshold and placing two cards in the landlords hands who forthwith presented them to the two young men he said please to deliver
