i woman is like a wave of the sea said shakespeare both the great king and the great poet ought to have known womans nature well womans yes my mother is not woman but a woman as i am only a humble foreigner you must pardon me if i do not understand all the subtle refinements of your language what i mean to say is that my mother is not quick to give her confidence but when she does she never changes ah yes indeed said monte cristo with a sigh and do you think she is in the least interested in me i repeat it you must really be a very strange and superior man for my mother is so absorbed by the interest you have excited that when i am with her she speaks of no one else and does she try to make you dislike me on the contrary she often says morcerf i believe the count has a noble nature try to gain his esteem indeed said monte cristo sighing you see then said albert that instead of opposing she will encourage me adieu then until five oclock be punctual and we shall arrive at twelve or one at trport yes or in the neighborhood but can we travel forty-eight leagues in eight hours easily said monte cristo you are certainly a prodigy you will soon not only surpass the railway which would not be very difficult in france but even the telegraph but viscount since we cannot perform the journey in less than seven or eight hours do not keep me waiting do not fear i have little to prepare monte cristo smiled as he nodded to albert then remained a moment absorbed in deep meditation but passing his hand across his forehead as if to dispel his reverie he rang the bell twice and bertuccio entered bertuccio said he i intend going this evening to normandy instead of tomorrow or the next day you will have sufficient time before five oclock despatch a messenger to apprise the grooms at the first station m de morcerf will accompany me bertuccio obeyed and despatched a courier to pontoise to say the travelling-carriage would arrive at six oclock from pontoise another express was sent to the next stage and in six hours all the horses stationed on the road were ready before his departure the count went to haydes apartments told her his intention and resigned everything to her care albert was punctual the journey soon became interesting from its rapidity of which morcerf had formed no previous idea truly said monte cristo with your post-horses going at the rate of two leagues an hour and that absurd law that one traveller shall not pass another without permission so that an invalid or ill-tempered traveller may detain those who are well and active it is impossible to move i escape this annoyance by travelling with my own postilion and horses do i not ali the count put his head out of the window and whistled and the horses appeared to fly the carriage rolled with a thundering noise over the pavement and everyone turned to notice the dazzling meteor ali smiling repeated the sound grasped the reins with a firm hand and spurred his horses whose beautiful manes floated in the breeze this child of the desert was in his element and with his black face and sparkling eyes appeared in the cloud of dust he raised like the genius of the simoom and the god of the hurricane i never knew till now the delight of speed said morcerf and the last cloud disappeared from his brow but where the devil do you get such horses are they made to order
