being no other than andrea the commissary and gendarme who was a brigadier directed their steps towards his room they found the door ajar oh oh said the brigadier who thoroughly understood the trick a bad sign to find the door open i would rather find it triply bolted and indeed the little note and pin upon the table confirmed or rather corroborated the sad truth andrea had fled we say corroborated because the brigadier was too experienced to be convinced by a single proof he glanced around looked in the bed shook the curtains opened the closets and finally stopped at the chimney andrea had taken the precaution to leave no traces of his feet in the ashes but still it was an outlet and in this light was not to be passed over without serious investigation the brigadier sent for some sticks and straw and having filled the chimney with them set a light to it the fire crackled and the smoke ascended like the dull vapor from a volcano but still no prisoner fell down as they expected the fact was that andrea at war with society ever since his youth was quite as deep as a gendarme even though he were advanced to the rank of brigadier and quite prepared for the fire he had climbed out on the roof and was crouching down against the chimney-pots m at one time he thought he was saved for he heard the brigadier exclaim in a loud voice to the two gendarmes he is not here but venturing to peep he perceived that the latter instead of retiring as might have been reasonably expected upon this announcement were watching with increased attention it was now his turn to look about him the htel de ville a massive sixteenth century building was on his right anyone could descend from the openings in the tower and examine every corner of the roof below and andrea expected momentarily to see the head of a gendarme appear at one of these openings if once discovered he knew he would be lost for the roof afforded no chance of escape he therefore resolved to descend not through the same chimney by which he had come up but by a similar one conducting to another room he looked around for a chimney from which no smoke issued and having reached it he disappeared through the orifice without being seen by anyone at the same minute one of the little windows of the htel de ville was thrown open and the head of a gendarme appeared for an instant it remained motionless as one of the stone decorations of the building then after a long sigh of disappointment the head disappeared the brigadier calm and dignified as the law he represented passed through the crowd without answering the thousand questions addressed to him and re-entered the hotel well asked the two gendarmes well my boys said the brigadier the brigand must really have escaped early this morning but we will send to the villers-coterets and noyon roads and search the forest when we shall catch him no doubt the honorable functionary had scarcely expressed himself thus in that intonation which is peculiar to brigadiers of the gendarmerie when a loud scream accompanied by the violent ringing of a bell resounded through the court of the hotel ah what is that cried the brigadier some traveller seems impatient said the host what number was it that rang number run waiter at this moment the screams and ringing were redoubled aha said the brigadier stopping the servant the person who is ringing appears to want something more than a waiter we will attend upon him with a gendarme who occupies number the
