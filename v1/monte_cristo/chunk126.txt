he wished for by simple and natural means and land on the island without incurring any suspicion one night more and he would be on his way the night was one of feverish distraction and in its progress visions good and evil passed through dants mind if he closed his eyes he saw cardinal spadas letter written on the wall in characters of flame if he slept for a moment the wildest dreams haunted his brain he ascended into grottos paved with emeralds with panels of rubies and the roof glowing with diamond stalactites pearls fell drop by drop as subterranean waters filter in their caves edmond amazed wonderstruck filled his pockets with the radiant gems and then returned to daylight when he discovered that his prizes had all changed into common pebbles he then endeavored to re-enter the marvellous grottos but they had suddenly receded and now the path became a labyrinth and then the entrance vanished and in vain did he tax his memory for the magic and mysterious word which opened the splendid caverns of ali baba to the arabian fisherman all was useless the treasure disappeared and had again reverted to the genii from whom for a moment he had hoped to carry it off the day came at length and was almost as feverish as the night had been but it brought reason to the aid of imagination and dants was then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and unsettled in his brain night came and with it the preparation for departure and these preparations served to conceal dants agitation he had by degrees assumed such authority over his companions that he was almost like a commander on board and as his orders were always clear distinct and easy of execution his comrades obeyed him with celerity and pleasure the old patron did not interfere for he too had recognized the superiority of dants over the crew and himself he saw in the young man his natural successor and regretted that he had not a daughter that he might have bound edmond to him by a more secure alliance at seven oclock in the evening all was ready and at ten minutes past seven they doubled the lighthouse just as the beacon was kindled the sea was calm and with a fresh breeze from the south-east they sailed beneath a bright blue sky in which god also lighted up in turn his beacon lights each of which is a world dants told them that all hands might turn in and he would take the helm when the maltese for so they called dants had said this it was sufficient and all went to their bunks contentedly this frequently happened dants cast from solitude into the world frequently experienced an imperious desire for solitude and what solitude is more complete or more poetical than that of a ship floating in isolation on the sea during the obscurity of the night in the silence of immensity and under the eye of heaven now this solitude was peopled with his thoughts the night lighted up by his illusions and the silence animated by his anticipations when the patron awoke the vessel was hurrying on with every sail set and every sail full with the breeze they were making nearly ten knots an hour the island of monte cristo loomed large in the horizon edmond resigned the lugger to the masters care and went and lay down in his hammock but in spite of a sleepless night he could not close his eyes for a moment two hours afterwards he came on deck as the boat was about to double the island of elba they were just abreast of mareciana
