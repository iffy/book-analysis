money excuse me excuse me but i owe this money to the charity fund a deposit which i promised to pay this morning oh well then said monte cristo i am not particular about these five notes pay me in a different form i wished from curiosity to take these that i might be able to say that without any advice or preparation the house of danglars had paid me five millions without a minutes delay it would have been remarkable but here are your bonds pay me differently and he held the bonds towards danglars who seized them like a vulture extending its claws to withhold the food that is being wrested from its grasp suddenly he rallied made a violent effort to restrain himself and then a smile gradually widened the features of his disturbed countenance m certainly he said your receipt is money oh dear yes and if you were at rome the house of thomson french would make no more difficulty about paying the money on my receipt than you have just done pardon me count pardon me then i may keep this money yes said danglars while the perspiration started from the roots of his hair yes keep it keep it monte cristo replaced the notes in his pocket with that indescribable expression which seemed to say come reflect if you repent there is still time no said danglars no decidedly no keep my signatures but you know none are so formal as bankers in transacting business i intended this money for the charity fund and i seemed to be robbing them if i did not pay them with these precise bonds how absurd as if one crown were not as good as another excuse me and he began to laugh loudly but nervously certainly i excuse you said monte cristo graciously and pocket them and he placed the bonds in his pocket-book but said danglars there is still a sum of one hundred thousand francs oh a mere nothing said monte cristo the balance would come to about that sum but keep it and we shall be quits count said danglars are you speaking seriously i never joke with bankers said monte cristo in a freezing manner which repelled impertinence and he turned to the door just as the valet de chambre announced m de boville receiver-general of the charities ma foi said monte cristo i think i arrived just in time to obtain your signatures or they would have been disputed with me danglars again became pale and hastened to conduct the count out monte cristo exchanged a ceremonious bow with m de boville who was standing in the waiting-room and who was introduced into danglars room as soon as the count had left the counts serious face was illumined by a faint smile as he noticed the portfolio which the receiver-general held in his hand at the door he found his carriage and was immediately driven to the bank meanwhile danglars repressing all emotion advanced to meet the receiver-general we need not say that a smile of condescension was stamped upon his lips good-morning creditor said he for i wager anything it is the creditor who visits me you are right baron answered m de boville the charities present themselves to you through me the widows and orphans depute me to receive alms to the amount of five millions from you and yet they say orphans are to be pitied said danglars wishing to prolong the jest poor things here i am in their name said m de boville but did you receive my letter yesterday yes i have brought my receipt m my dear m de boville your widows and orphans must oblige me by
