it not be a sweet revenge for him when he found that i had not died from the blow of his dagger it was therefore necessary before everything else and at all risks that i should cause all traces of the past to disappear that i should destroy every material vestige too much reality would always remain in my recollection it was for this i had annulled the lease it was for this i had come it was for this i was waiting night arrived i allowed it to become quite dark i was without a light in that room when the wind shook all the doors behind which i continually expected to see some spy concealed i trembled i seemed everywhere to hear your moans behind me in the bed and i dared not turn around my heart beat so violently that i feared my wound would open at length one by one all the noises in the neighborhood ceased i understood that i had nothing to fear that i should neither be seen nor heard so i decided upon descending to the garden listen hermine i consider myself as brave as most men but when i drew from my breast the little key of the staircase which i had found in my coat that little key we both used to cherish so much which you wished to have fastened to a golden ring when i opened the door and saw the pale moon shedding a long stream of white light on the spiral staircase like a spectre i leaned against the wall and nearly shrieked i seemed to be going mad at last i mastered my agitation i descended the staircase step by step the only thing i could not conquer was a strange trembling in my knees i grasped the railings if i had relaxed my hold for a moment i should have fallen i reached the lower door outside this door a spade was placed against the wall i took it and advanced towards the thicket i had provided myself with a dark lantern in the middle of the lawn i stopped to light it then i continued my path it was the end of november all the verdure of the garden had disappeared the trees were nothing more than skeletons with their long bony arms and the dead leaves sounded on the gravel under my feet my terror overcame me to such a degree as i approached the thicket that i took a pistol from my pocket and armed myself i fancied continually that i saw the figure of the corsican between the branches i examined the thicket with my dark lantern it was empty i looked carefully around i was indeed alone no noise disturbed the silence but the owl whose piercing cry seemed to be calling up the phantoms of the night i tied my lantern to a forked branch i had noticed a year before at the precise spot where i stopped to dig the hole the grass had grown very thickly there during the summer and when autumn arrived no one had been there to mow it still one place where the grass was thin attracted my attention it evidently was there i had turned up the ground i went to work the hour then for which i had been waiting during the last year had at length arrived how i worked how i hoped how i struck every piece of turf thinking to find some resistance to my spade but no i found nothing though i had made a hole twice as large as the first i thought i had been deceived had mistaken the spot i turned around i looked at the trees i
