the small shagreen case which he turned over and over in his hand did not seem to him commensurate in value to the enormous sum which fascinated his gaze he turned towards his wife what do you think of this he asked in a low voice let him have it let him have it she said if he returns to beaucaire without the diamond he will inform against us and as he says who knows if we shall ever again see the abb busoni in all probability we shall never see him well then so i will said caderousse so you may have the diamond for francs but my wife wants a gold chain and i want a pair of silver buckles the jeweller drew from his pocket a long flat box which contained several samples of the articles demanded here he said i am very straightforward in my dealings take your choice the woman selected a gold chain worth about five louis and the husband a pair of buckles worth perhaps fifteen francs i hope you will not complain now said the jeweller the abb told me it was worth francs muttered caderousse come come give it to me what a strange fellow you are said the jeweller taking the diamond from his hand i give you francs that is livres of income a fortune such as i wish i had myself and you are not satisfied and the five-and-forty thousand francs inquired caderousse in a hoarse voice where are they come let us see them here they are replied the jeweller and he counted out upon the table francs in gold and francs in bank-notes wait whilst i light the lamp said la carconte it is growing dark and there may be some mistake in fact night had come on during this conversation and with night the storm which had been threatening for the last half-hour the thunder growled in the distance but it was apparently not heard by the jeweller caderousse or la carconte absorbed as they were all three with the demon of gain i myself felt a strange kind of fascination at the sight of all this gold and all these bank-notes it seemed to me that i was in a dream and as it always happens in a dream i felt myself riveted to the spot caderousse counted and again counted the gold and the notes then handed them to his wife who counted and counted them again in her turn during this time the jeweller made the diamond play and sparkle in the lamplight and the gem threw out jets of light which made him unmindful of those which precursors of the storm began to play in at the windows well inquired the jeweller is the cash all right yes said caderousse give me the pocket-book la carconte and find a bag somewhere la carconte went to a cupboard and returned with an old leathern pocket-book and a bag from the former she took some greasy letters and put in their place the bank-notes and from the bag took two or three crowns of six livres each which in all probability formed the entire fortune of the miserable couple there said caderousse and now although you have wronged us of perhaps francs will you have your supper with us i invite you with good-will thank you replied the jeweller it must be getting late and i must return to beaucaire my wife will be getting uneasy he drew out his watch and exclaimed morbleu nearly nine oclock why i shall not get back to beaucaire before midnight good-night my friends if the abb busoni should by any accident return think of me in another week you will have
