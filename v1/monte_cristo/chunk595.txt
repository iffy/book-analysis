yanina whom i have brought up with the love of a father and who has shown the love and tenderness of a daughter for me he will thus accomplish my last wish this will has already constituted hayde heiress of the rest of my fortune consisting of lands funds in england austria and holland furniture in my different palaces and houses and which without the twenty millions and the legacies to my servants may still amount to sixty millions m he was finishing the last line when a cry behind him made him start and the pen fell from his hand hayde said he did you read it oh my lord said she why are you writing thus at such an hour why are you bequeathing all your fortune to me are you going to leave me i am going on a journey dear child said monte cristo with an expression of infinite tenderness and melancholy and if any misfortune should happen to me the count stopped well asked the young girl with an authoritative tone the count had never observed before and which startled him well if any misfortune happen to me replied monte cristo i wish my daughter to be happy hayde smiled sorrowfully and shook her head do you think of dying my lord said she the wise man my child has said it is good to think of death well if you die said she bequeath your fortune to others for if you die i shall require nothing and taking the paper she tore it in four pieces and threw it into the middle of the room then the effort having exhausted her strength she fell not asleep this time but fainting on the floor the count leaned over her and raised her in his arms and seeing that sweet pale face those lovely eyes closed that beautiful form motionless and to all appearance lifeless the idea occurred to him for the first time that perhaps she loved him otherwise than as a daughter loves a father alas murmured he with intense suffering i might then have been happy yet then he carried hayde to her room resigned her to the care of her attendants and returning to his study which he shut quickly this time he again copied the destroyed will as he was finishing the sound of a cabriolet entering the yard was heard monte cristo approached the window and saw maximilian and emmanuel alight good said he it was time and he sealed his will with three seals a moment afterwards he heard a noise in the drawing-room and went to open the door himself morrel was there he had come twenty minutes before the time appointed i am perhaps come too soon count said he but i frankly acknowledge that i have not closed my eyes all night nor has anyone in my house i need to see you strong in your courageous assurance to recover myself monte cristo could not resist this proof of affection he not only extended his hand to the young man but flew to him with open arms morrel said he it is a happy day for me to feel that i am beloved by such a man as you good-morning emmanuel you will come with me then maximilian did you doubt it said the young captain but if i were wrong i watched you during the whole scene of that challenge yesterday i have been thinking of your firmness all night and i said to myself that justice must be on your side or mans countenance is no longer to be relied on but morrel albert is your friend simply an acquaintance sir you met on the same day you first
