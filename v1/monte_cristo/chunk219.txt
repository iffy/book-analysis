and indifferences during the carnival knowing full well that among the different states and kingdoms in which this festivity is celebrated rome is the spot where even the wisest and gravest throw off the usual rigidity of their lives and deign to mingle in the follies of this time of liberty and relaxation the carnival was to commence on the morrow therefore albert had not an instant to lose in setting forth the programme of his hopes expectations and claims to notice with this design he had engaged a box in the most conspicuous part of the theatre and exerted himself to set off his personal attractions by the aid of the most rich and elaborate toilet the box taken by albert was in the first circle although each of the three tiers of boxes is deemed equally aristocratic and is for this reason generally styled the nobilitys boxes and although the box engaged for the two friends was sufficiently capacious to contain at least a dozen persons it had cost less than would be paid at some of the french theatres for one admitting merely four occupants another motive had influenced alberts selection of his seat who knew but that thus advantageously placed he might not in truth attract the notice of some fair roman and an introduction might ensue that would procure him the offer of a seat in a carriage or a place in a princely balcony from which he might behold the gayeties of the carnival these united considerations made albert more lively and anxious to please than he had hitherto been totally disregarding the business of the stage he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizing the beauty of each pretty woman aided by a powerful opera-glass but alas this attempt to attract notice wholly failed not even curiosity had been excited and it was but too apparent that the lovely creatures into whose good graces he was desirous of stealing were all so much engrossed with themselves their lovers or their own thoughts that they had not so much as noticed him or the manipulation of his glass the truth was that the anticipated pleasures of the carnival with the holy week that was to succeed it so filled every fair breast as to prevent the least attention being bestowed even on the business of the stage the actors made their entries and exits unobserved or unthought of at certain conventional moments the spectators would suddenly cease their conversation or rouse themselves from their musings to listen to some brilliant effort of morianis a well-executed recitative by coselli or to join in loud applause at the wonderful powers of la specchia but that momentary excitement over they quickly relapsed into their former state of preoccupation or interesting conversation towards the close of the first act the door of a box which had been hitherto vacant was opened a lady entered to whom franz had been introduced in paris where indeed he had imagined she still was the quick eye of albert caught the involuntary start with which his friend beheld the new arrival and turning to him he said hastily do you know the woman who has just entered that box yes what do you think of her oh she is perfectly lovely what a complexion and such magnificent hair is she french no a venetian and her name is countess g ah i know her by name exclaimed albert she is said to possess as much wit and cleverness as beauty i was to have been presented to her when i met her at madame villeforts ball shall i assist you in repairing your negligence asked franz my dear fellow are you really on such good terms
