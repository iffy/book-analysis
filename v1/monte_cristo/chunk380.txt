auteuil if i were to invite you and the count and countess of morcerf to this dinner i should give it the appearance of being a matrimonial meeting or at least madame de morcerf would look upon the affair in that light especially if baron danglars did me the honor to bring his daughter in that case your mother would hold me in aversion and i do not at all wish that on the contrary i desire to stand high in her esteem indeed count said morcerf i thank you sincerely for having used so much candor towards me and i gratefully accept the exclusion which you propose you say you desire my mothers good opinion i assure you it is already yours to a very unusual extent m do you think so said monte cristo with interest oh i am sure of it we talked of you an hour after you left us the other day but to return to what we were saying if my mother could know of this attention on your part and i will venture to tell her i am sure that she will be most grateful to you it is true that my father will be equally angry the count laughed well said he to morcerf but i think your father will not be the only angry one m and madame danglars will think me a very ill-mannered person they know that i am intimate with you that you are in fact one of the oldest of my parisian acquaintances and they will not find you at my house they will certainly ask me why i did not invite you be sure to provide yourself with some previous engagement which shall have a semblance of probability and communicate the fact to me by a line in writing you know that with bankers nothing but a written document will be valid i will do better than that said albert my mother is wishing to go to the sea-side what day is fixed for your dinner saturday this is tuesday well tomorrow evening we leave and the day after we shall be at trport really count you have a delightful way of setting people at their ease indeed you give me more credit than i deserve i only wish to do what will be agreeable to you that is all when shall you send your invitations this very day well i will immediately call on m danglars and tell him that my mother and myself must leave paris tomorrow i have not seen you consequently i know nothing of your dinner how foolish you are have you forgotten that m debray has just seen you at my house ah true fix it this way i have seen you and invited you without any ceremony when you instantly answered that it would be impossible for you to accept as you were going to trport well then that is settled but you will come and call on my mother before tomorrow before tomorrow that will be a difficult matter to arrange besides i shall just be in the way of all the preparations for departure well you can do better you were only a charming man before but if you accede to my proposal you will be adorable what must i do to attain such sublimity you are today free as air come and dine with me we shall be a small party only yourself my mother and i you have scarcely seen my mother you shall have an opportunity of observing her more closely she is a remarkable woman and i only regret that there does not exist another like her about twenty years younger in that case i assure you there
