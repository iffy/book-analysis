i had a similar attack the year previous to my imprisonment this malady admits but of one remedy i will tell you what that is go into my cell as quickly as you can draw out one of the feet that support the bed you will find it has been hollowed out for the purpose of containing a small phial you will see there half-filled with a red-looking fluid bring it to me or rather no no i may be found here therefore help me back to my room while i have the strength to drag myself along who knows what may happen or how long the attack may last in spite of the magnitude of the misfortune which thus suddenly frustrated his hopes dants did not lose his presence of mind but descended into the passage dragging his unfortunate companion with him then half-carrying half-supporting him he managed to reach the abbs chamber when he immediately laid the sufferer on his bed thanks said the poor abb shivering as though his veins were filled with ice i am about to be seized with a fit of catalepsy when it comes to its height i shall probably lie still and motionless as though dead uttering neither sigh nor groan on the other hand the symptoms may be much more violent and cause me to fall into fearful convulsions foam at the mouth and cry out loudly take care my cries are not heard for if they are it is more than probable i should be removed to another part of the prison and we be separated forever when i become quite motionless cold and rigid as a corpse then and not before be careful about this force open my teeth with the knife pour from eight to ten drops of the liquor contained in the phial down my throat and i may perhaps revive perhaps exclaimed dants in grief-stricken tones help help cried the abb i i die i m so sudden and violent was the fit that the unfortunate prisoner was unable to complete the sentence a violent convulsion shook his whole frame his eyes started from their sockets his mouth was drawn on one side his cheeks became purple he struggled foamed dashed himself about and uttered the most dreadful cries which however dants prevented from being heard by covering his head with the blanket the fit lasted two hours then more helpless than an infant and colder and paler than marble more crushed and broken than a reed trampled under foot he fell back doubled up in one last convulsion and became as rigid as a corpse edmond waited till life seemed extinct in the body of his friend then taking up the knife he with difficulty forced open the closely fixed jaws carefully administered the appointed number of drops and anxiously awaited the result an hour passed away and the old man gave no sign of returning animation dants began to fear he had delayed too long ere he administered the remedy and thrusting his hands into his hair continued gazing on the lifeless features of his friend at length a slight color tinged the livid cheeks consciousness returned to the dull open eyeballs a faint sigh issued from the lips and the sufferer made a feeble effort to move he is saved he is saved cried dants in a paroxysm of delight the sick man was not yet able to speak but he pointed with evident anxiety towards the door dants listened and plainly distinguished the approaching steps of the jailer it was therefore near seven oclock but edmonds anxiety had put all thoughts of time out of his head the young man sprang to the entrance darted through it
