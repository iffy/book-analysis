be right for him to neglect me dont you neglect him why mother i thought youd take my part so i do as far as sympathizing goes but i think the fault is yours meg i dont see how let me show you did john ever neglect you as you call it while you made it a point to give him your society of an evening his only leisure time no but i cant do it now with two babies to tend i think you could dear and i think you ought may i speak quite freely and will you remember that its mother who blames as well as mother who sympathizes indeed i will speak to me as if i were little meg again i often feel as if i needed teaching more than ever since these babies look to me for everything meg drew her low chair beside her mothers and with a little interruption in either lap the two women rocked and talked lovingly together feeling that the tie of motherhood made them more one than ever you have only made the mistake that most young wives make forgotten your duty to your husband in your love for your children a very natural and forgivable mistake meg but one that had better be remedied before you take to different ways for children should draw you nearer than ever not separate you as if they were all yours and john had nothing to do but support them ive seen
