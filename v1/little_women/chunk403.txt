the poor little romance like a picked robin out into the big busy world to try its fate well it was printed and she got three hundred dollars for it likewise plenty of praise and blame both so much greater than she expected that she was thrown into a state of bewilderment from which it took her some time to recover you said mother that criticism would help me but how can it when its so contradictory that i dont know whether ive written a promising book or broken all the ten commandments cried poor jo turning over a heap of notices the perusal of which filled her with pride and joy one minute wrath and dismay the next this man says an exquisite book full of truth beauty and earnestness all is sweet pure and healthy continued the perplexed authoress the next the theory of the book is bad full of morbid fancies spiritualistic ideas and unnatural characters now as i had no theory of any kind dont believe in spiritualism and copied my characters from life i dont see how this critic can be right another says its one of the best american novels which has appeared for years i know better than that and the next asserts that though it is original and written with great force and feeling it is a dangerous book tisnt some make fun of it some overpraise and nearly all insist that i had a deep theory to expound when i only wrote it
