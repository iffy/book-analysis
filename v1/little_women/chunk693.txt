those are people whom its a satisfaction to help for if theyve got genius its an honor to be allowed to serve them and not let it be lost or delayed for want of fuel to keep the pot boiling if they havent its a pleasure to comfort the poor souls and keep them from despair when they find it out yes indeed and theres another class who cant ask and who suffer in silence i know something of it for i belonged to it before you made a princess of me as the king does the beggarmaid in the old story ambitious girls have a hard time laurie and often have to see youth health and precious opportunities go by just for want of a little help at the right minute people have been very kind to me and whenever i see girls struggling along as we used to do i want to put out my hand and help them as i was helped and so you shall like an angel as you are cried laurie resolving with a glow of philanthropic zeal to found and endow an institution for the express benefit of young women with artistic tendencies rich people have no right to sit down and enjoy themselves or let their money accumulate for others to waste its not half so sensible to leave legacies when one dies as it is to use the money wisely while alive and enjoy making ones fellow creatures happy with it well
