funeral i poked again and said a little faster then off he went helter-skelter as before and we resigned ourselves to our fate today was fair and we went to hyde park close by for we are more aristocratic than we look the duke of devonshire lives near i often see his footmen lounging at the back gate and the duke of wellingtons house is not far off such sights as i saw my dear it was as good as punch for there were fat dowagers rolling about in their red and yellow coaches with gorgeous jeameses in silk stockings and velvet coats up behind and powdered coachmen in front smart maids with the rosiest children i ever saw handsome girls looking half asleep dandies in queer english hats and lavender kids lounging about and tall soldiers in short red jackets and muffin caps stuck on one side looking so funny i longed to sketch them rotten row means route de roi or the kings way but now its more like a riding school than anything else the horses are splendid and the men especially the grooms ride well but the women are stiff and bounce which isnt according to our rules i longed to show them a tearing american gallop for they trotted solemnly up and down in their scant habits and high hats looking like the women in a toy noahs ark everyone rides old men stout ladies little children and the young folks do a deal of flirting here
