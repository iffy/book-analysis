love to everyone from your faithful jo ps on reading over my letter it strikes me as rather bhaery but i am always interested in odd people and i really had nothing else to write about bless you december my precious betsey as this is to be a scribble-scrabble letter i direct it to you for it may amuse you and give you some idea of my goings on for though quiet they are rather amusing for which oh be joyful after what amy would call herculaneum efforts in the way of mental and moral agriculture my young ideas begin to shoot and my little twigs to bend as i could wish they are not so interesting to me as tina and the boys but i do my duty by them and they are fond of me franz and emil are jolly little lads quite after my own heart for the mixture of german and american spirit in them produces a constant state of effervescence saturday afternoons are riotous times whether spent in the house or out for on pleasant days they all go to walk like a seminary with the professor and myself to keep order and then such fun we are very good friends now and ive begun to take lessons i really couldnt help it and it all came about in such a droll way that i must tell you to begin at the beginning mrs kirke called to me one day as i passed mr bhaers room
