into a world where she could not follow mother do you have plans as mrs moffat said asked meg bashfully yes my dear i have a great many all mothers do but mine differ somewhat from mrs moffats i suspect i will tell you some of them for the time has come when a word may set this romantic little head and heart of yours right on a very serious subject you are young meg but not too young to understand me and mothers lips are the fittest to speak of such things to girls like you jo your turn will come in time perhaps so listen to my plans and help me carry them out if they are good jo went and sat on one arm of the chair looking as if she thought they were about to join in some very solemn affair holding a hand of each and watching the two young faces wistfully mrs march said in her serious yet cheery way i want my daughters to be beautiful accomplished and good to be admired loved and respected to have a happy youth to be well and wisely married and to lead useful pleasant lives with as little care and sorrow to try them as god sees fit to send to be loved and chosen by a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a woman and i sincerely hope my girls may know this beautiful experience it is natural to think of
