time tea parties didnt amount to much neither did picnics unless very well conducted if one could have a fine house full of nice girls or go traveling the summer would be delightful but to stay at home with three selfish sisters and a grown-up boy was enough to try the patience of a boaz complained miss malaprop after several days devoted to pleasure fretting and ennui no one would own that they were tired of the experiment but by friday night each acknowledged to herself that she was glad the week was nearly done hoping to impress the lesson more deeply mrs march who had a good deal of humor resolved to finish off the trial in an appropriate manner so she gave hannah a holiday and let the girls enjoy the full effect of the play system when they got up on saturday morning there was no fire in the kitchen no breakfast in the dining room and no mother anywhere to be seen mercy on us what has happened cried jo staring about her in dismay meg ran upstairs and soon came back again looking relieved but rather bewildered and a little ashamed mother isnt sick only very tired and she says she is going to stay quietly in her room all day and let us do the best we can its a very queer thing for her to do she doesnt act a bit like herself but she says it has been a hard week for her so
