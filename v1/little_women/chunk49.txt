enjoy ourselves half so much as we do now but it does seem so nice to have little suppers and bouquets and go to parties and drive home and read and rest and not work its like other people you know and i always envy girls who do such things im so fond of luxury said meg trying to decide which of two shabby gowns was the least shabby well we cant have it so dont let us grumble but shoulder our bundles and trudge along as cheerfully as marmee does im sure aunt march is a regular old man of the sea to me but i suppose when ive learned to carry her without complaining she will tumble off or get so light that i shant mind her this idea tickled jos fancy and put her in good spirits but meg didnt brighten for her burden consisting of four spoiled children seemed heavier than ever she had not heart enough even to make herself pretty as usual by putting on a blue neck ribbon and dressing her hair in the most becoming way wheres the use of looking nice when no one sees me but those cross midgets and no one cares whether im pretty or not she muttered shutting her drawer with a jerk i shall have to toil and moil all my days with only little bits of fun now and then and get old and ugly and sour because im poor and cant enjoy my life as other
