family and if you get dismal there is no fair weather then id try to take an interest in whatever john likes talk with him let him read to you exchange ideas and help each other in that way dont shut yourself up in a bandbox because you are a woman but understand what is going on and educate yourself to take your part in the worlds work for it all affects you and yours john is so sensible im afraid he will think im stupid if i ask questions about politics and things i dont believe he would love covers a multitude of sins and of whom could you ask more freely than of him try it and see if he doesnt find your society far more agreeable than mrs scotts suppers i will poor john im afraid i have neglected him sadly but i thought i was right and he never said anything he tried not to be selfish but he has felt rather forlorn i fancy this is just the time meg when young married people are apt to grow apart and the very time when they ought to be most together for the first tenderness soon wears off unless care is taken to preserve it and no time is so beautiful and precious to parents as the first years of the little lives given to them to train dont let john be a stranger to the babies for they will do more to keep him safe and
