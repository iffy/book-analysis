the letter of my bond shylock there is a pile of clouds in the east its not fair and i dont go now thats shirking its a lovely day no prospect of rain and you pride yourself on keeping promises so be honorable come and do your duty and then be at peace for another six months at that minute jo was particularly absorbed in dressmaking for she was mantua-maker general to the family and took especial credit to herself because she could use a needle as well as a pen it was very provoking to be arrested in the act of a first trying-on and ordered out to make calls in her best array on a warm july day she hated calls of the formal sort and never made any till amy compelled her with a bargain bribe or promise in the present instance there was no escape and having clashed her scissors rebelliously while protesting that she smelled thunder she gave in put away her work and taking up her hat and gloves with an air of resignation told amy the victim was ready jo march you are perverse enough to provoke a saint you dont intend to make calls in that state i hope cried amy surveying her with amazement why not im neat and cool and comfortable quite proper for a dusty walk on a warm day if people care more for my clothes than they do for me i dont wish to see them you can dress
