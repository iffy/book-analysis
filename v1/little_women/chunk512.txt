on to the floor and marched out of the room i felt myself disgraced and deserted forever but didnt blame him a particle and was scrambling my papers together meaning to rush upstairs and shake myself hard when in he came as brisk and beaming as if id covered myself in glory now we shall try a new way you and i will read these pleasant little marchen together and dig no more in that dry book that goes in the corner for making us trouble he spoke so kindly and opened hans andersons fairy tales so invitingly before me that i was more ashamed than ever and went at my lesson in a neck-or-nothing style that seemed to amuse him immensely i forgot my bashfulness and pegged away no other word will express it with all my might tumbling over long words pronouncing according to inspiration of the minute and doing my very best when i finished reading my first page and stopped for breath he clapped his hands and cried out in his hearty way das ist gut now we go well my turn i do him in german gif me your ear and away he went rumbling out the words with his strong voice and a relish which was good to see as well as hear fortunately the story was the constant tin soldier which is droll you know so i could laugh and i did though i didnt understand half he read for i couldnt help it
