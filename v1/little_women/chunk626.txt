blossom in the dust the self-forgetfulness that makes the humblest on earth remembered soonest in heaven the true success which is possible to all one night when beth looked among the books upon her table to find something to make her forget the mortal weariness that was almost as hard to bear as pain as she turned the leaves of her old favorite pilgrimss progress she found a little paper scribbled over in jos hand the name caught her eye and the blurred look of the lines made her sure that tears had fallen on it poor jo shes fast asleep so i wont wake her to ask leave she shows me all her things and i dont think shell mind if i look at this thought beth with a glance at her sister who lay on the rug with the tongs beside her ready to wake up the minute the log fell apart my beth sitting patient in the shadow till the blessed light shall come a serene and saintly presence sanctifies our troubled home earthly joys and hopes and sorrows break like ripples on the strand of the deep and solemn river where her willing feet now stand o my sister passing from me out of human care and strife leave me as a gift those virtues which have beautified your life dear bequeath me that great patience which has power to sustain a cheerful uncomplaining spirit in its prison-house of pain give me for i need it sorely
