ask for a ninepence meg gave all her quarterly salary toward the rent and i only got some clothes with mine so i felt wicked and was bound to have some money if i sold the nose off my face to get it you neednt feel wicked my child you had no winter things and got the simplest with your own hard earnings said mrs march with a look that warmed jos heart i hadnt the least idea of selling my hair at first but as i went along i kept thinking what i could do and feeling as if id like to dive into some of the rich stores and help myself in a barbers window i saw tails of hair with the prices marked and one black tail not so thick as mine was forty dollars it came to me all of a sudden that i had one thing to make money out of and without stopping to think i walked in asked if they bought hair and what they would give for mine i dont see how you dared to do it said beth in a tone of awe oh he was a little man who looked as if he merely lived to oil his hair he rather stared at first as if he wasnt used to having girls bounce into his shop and ask him to buy their hair he said he didnt care about mine it wasnt the fashionable color and he never paid much for it
