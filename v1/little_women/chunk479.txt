matter was he said hed just got a letter begging him to come home for frank was very ill so he was going at once on the night train and only had time to say good-by i was very sorry for him and disappointed for myself but only for a minute because he said as he shook hands and said it in a way that i could not mistake i shall soon come back you wont forget me amy i didnt promise but i looked at him and he seemed satisfied and there was no time for anything but messages and good-byes for he was off in an hour and we all miss him very much i know he wanted to speak but i think from something he once hinted that he had promised his father not to do anything of the sort yet a while for he is a rash boy and the old gentleman dreads a foreign daughter-in-law we shall soon meet in rome and then if i dont change my mind ill say yes thank you when he says will you please of course this is all very private but i wished you to know what was going on dont be anxious about me remember i am your prudent amy and be sure i will do nothing rashly send me as much advice as you like ill use it if i can i wish i could see you for a good talk marmee love and trust me ever your
