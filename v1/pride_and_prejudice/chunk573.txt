thankful that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice oh lydia i comfort myself with thinking replied jane that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or anything like it has been advanced he has children of his own and may have more how could he spare half ten thousand pounds if he were ever able to learn what wickhams debts have been said elizabeth and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them because wickham has not sixpence of his own the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited their taking her home and affording her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage
