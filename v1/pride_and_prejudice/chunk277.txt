however by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been lost my aunt she continued is going to-morrow into that part of the town and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingley i did not think caroline in spirits were her words but she was very glad to see me and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london i was right therefore my last letter had never reached her i enquired after their brother of course he was well but so much engaged with mr darcy that they scarcely ever saw him i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner i wish i could see her my visit was not long as caroline and mrs hurst were going out i dare say i shall see them soon here elizabeth shook her head over this letter
