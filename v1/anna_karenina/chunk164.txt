started pricked up her sharp ear and put out her strong black lip towards vronsky as though she would nip hold of his sleeve but remembering the muzzle she shook it and again began restlessly stamping one after the other her shapely legs quiet darling quiet he said patting her again over her hind-quarters and with a glad sense that his mare was in the best possible condition he went out of the horse-box the mares excitement had infected vronsky he felt that his heart was throbbing and that he too like the mare longed to move to bite it was both dreadful and delicious well i rely on you then he said to the englishman half-past six on the ground all right said the englishman oh where are you going my lord he asked suddenly using the title my lord which he had scarcely ever used before vronsky in amazement raised his head and stared as he knew how to stare not into the englishmans eyes but at his forehead astounded at the impertinence of his question but realizing that in asking this the englishman had been looking at him not as an employer but as a jockey he answered ive got to go to bryanskys i shall be home within an hour how often im asked that question today he said to himself and he blushed a thing which rarely happened to him the englishman looked gravely at him and as though he too knew where vronsky was going he added the great things to keep quiet before a race said he dont get out of temper or upset about anything all right answered vronsky smiling and jumping into his carriage he told the man to drive to peterhof before he had driven many paces away the dark clouds that had been threatening rain all day broke and there was a heavy downpour of rain what a pity thought vronsky putting up the roof of the carriage it was muddy before now it will be a perfect swamp as he sat in solitude in the closed carriage he took out his mothers letter and his brothers note and read them through yes it was the same thing over and over again everyone his mother his brother everyone thought fit to interfere in the affairs of his heart this interference aroused in him a feeling of angry hatred a feeling he had rarely known before what business is it of theirs why does everybody feel called upon to concern himself about me and why do they worry me so just because they see that this is something they cant understand if it were a common vulgar worldly intrigue they would have left me alone they feel that this is something different that this is not a mere pastime that this woman is dearer
