no importance whatever as sergey ivanovitch explained and levin busy seeing after his own affairs did not attend the meetings on the fourth day the auditing of the marshals accounts took place at the high table of the marshal of the province and then there occurred the first skirmish between the new party and the old the committee who had been deputed to verify the accounts reported to the meeting that all was in order the marshal of the province got up thanked the nobility for their confidence and shed tears the nobles gave him a loud welcome and shook hands with him but at that instant a nobleman of sergey ivanovitchs party said that he had heard that the committee had not verified the accounts considering such a verification an insult to the marshal of the province one of the members of the committee incautiously admitted this then a small gentleman very young-looking but very malignant began to say that it would probably be agreeable to the marshal of the province to give an account of his expenditures of the public moneys and that the misplaced delicacy of the members of the committee was depriving him of this moral satisfaction then the members of the committee tried to withdraw their admission and sergey ivanovitch began to prove that they must logically admit either that they had verified the accounts or that they had not and he developed this dilemma in detail sergey ivanovitch was answered by the spokesman of the opposite party then sviazhsky spoke and then the malignant gentleman again the discussion lasted a long time and ended in nothing levin was surprised that they should dispute upon this subject so long especially as when he asked sergey ivanovitch whether he supposed that money had been misappropriated sergey ivanovitch answered oh no hes an honest man but those old-fashioned methods of paternal family arrangements in the management of provincial affairs must be broken down on the fifth day came the elections of the district marshals it was rather a stormy day in several districts in the seleznevsky district sviazhsky was elected unanimously without a ballot and he gave a dinner that evening chapter the sixth day was fixed for the election of the marshal of the province the rooms large and small were full of noblemen in all sorts of uniforms many had come only for that day men who had not seen each other for years some from the crimea some from petersburg some from abroad met in the rooms of the hall of nobility there was much discussion around the governors table under the portrait of the tsar the nobles both in the larger and the smaller rooms grouped themselves in camps and from their hostile and suspicious glances from the silence that fell upon them when outsiders approached
