levin might from extreme sense of honor refuse vronsky and that levins arrival might generally complicate and delay the affair so near being concluded why has he been here long the princess asked about levin as they returned home he came today mamma theres one thing i want to say began the princess and from her serious and alert face kitty guessed what it would be mamma she said flushing hotly and turning quickly to her please please dont say anything about that i know i know all about it she wished for what her mother wished for but the motives of her mothers wishes wounded her i only want to say that to raise hopes mamma darling for goodness sake dont talk about it its so horrible to talk about it i wont said her mother seeing the tears in her daughters eyes but one thing my love you promised me you would have no secrets from me you wont never mamma none answered kitty flushing a little and looking her mother straight in the face but theres no use in my telling you anything and i i if i wanted to i dont know what to say or how i dont know no she could not tell an untruth with those eyes thought the mother smiling at her agitation and happiness the princess smiled that what was taking place just now in her soul seemed to the poor child so immense and so important chapter after dinner and till the beginning of the evening kitty was feeling a sensation akin to the sensation of a young man before a battle her heart throbbed violently and her thoughts would not rest on anything she felt that this evening when they would both meet for the first time would be a turning point in her life and she was continually picturing them to herself at one moment each separately and then both together when she mused on the past she dwelt with pleasure with tenderness on the memories of her relations with levin the memories of childhood and of levins friendship with her dead brother gave a special poetic charm to her relations with him his love for her of which she felt certain was flattering and delightful to her and it was pleasant for her to think of levin in her memories of vronsky there always entered a certain element of awkwardness though he was in the highest degree well-bred and at ease as though there were some false note not in vronsky he was very simple and nice but in herself while with levin she felt perfectly simple and clear but on the other hand directly she thought of the future with vronsky there arose before her a perspective of brilliant happiness with levin the future seemed misty when she went upstairs
