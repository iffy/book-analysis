with her now is she asleep how is she what is she thinking of is he crying my son dmitri and in the middle of the conversation in the middle of a sentence he jumped up and went out of the room send me word if i can see her said the prince very well in a minute answered levin and without stopping he went to her room she was not asleep she was talking gently with her mother making plans about the christening carefully set to rights with hair well-brushed in a smart little cap with some blue in it her arms out on the quilt she was lying on her back meeting his eyes her eyes drew him to her her face bright before brightened still more as he drew near her there was the same change in it from earthly to unearthly that is seen in the face of the dead but then it means farewell here it meant welcome again a rush of emotion such as he had felt at the moment of the childs birth flooded his heart she took his hand and asked him if he had slept he could not answer and turned away struggling with his weakness i have had a nap kostya she said to him and i am so comfortable now she looked at him but suddenly her expression changed give him to me she said hearing the babys cry give him to me lizaveta petrovna and he shall look at him to be sure his papa shall look at him said lizaveta petrovna getting up and bringing something red and queer and wriggling wait a minute well make him tidy first and lizaveta petrovna laid the red wobbling thing on the bed began untrussing and trussing up the baby lifting it up and turning it over with one finger and powdering it with something levin looking at the tiny pitiful creature made strenuous efforts to discover in his heart some traces of fatherly feeling for it he felt nothing towards it but disgust but when it was undressed and he caught a glimpse of wee wee little hands little feet saffron-colored with little toes too and positively with a little big toe different from the rest and when he saw lizaveta petrovna closing the wide-open little hands as though they were soft springs and putting them into linen garments such pity for the little creature came upon him and such terror that she would hurt it that he held her hand back lizaveta petrovna laughed dont be frightened dont be frightened when the baby had been put to rights and transformed into a firm doll lizaveta petrovna dandled it as though proud of her handiwork and stood a little away so that levin might see his son in all his glory kitty
