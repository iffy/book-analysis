must certainly take that room she said to vronsky in russian using the affectionately familiar form as though she saw that golenishtchev would become intimate with them in their isolation and that there was no need of reserve before him do you paint said golenishtchev turning round quickly to vronsky yes i used to study long ago and now i have begun to do a little said vronsky reddening he has great talent said anna with a delighted smile im no judge of course but good judges have said the same chapter anna in that first period of her emancipation and rapid return to health felt herself unpardonably happy and full of the joy of life the thought of her husbands unhappiness did not poison her happiness on one side that memory was too awful to be thought of on the other side her husbands unhappiness had given her too much happiness to be regretted the memory of all that had happened after her illness her reconciliation with her husband its breakdown the news of vronskys wound his visit the preparations for divorce the departure from her husbands house the parting from her son all that seemed to her like a delirious dream from which she had waked up alone with vronsky abroad the thought of the harm caused to her husband aroused in her a feeling like repulsion and akin to what a drowning man might feel who has shaken off another man clinging to him that man did drown it was an evil action of course but it was the sole means of escape and better not to brood over these fearful facts one consolatory reflection upon her conduct had occurred to her at the first moment of the final rupture and when now she recalled all the past she remembered that one reflection i have inevitably made that man wretched she thought but i dont want to profit by his misery i too am suffering and shall suffer i am losing what i prized above everything i am losing my good name and my son i have done wrong and so i dont want happiness i dont want a divorce and shall suffer from my shame and the separation from my child but however sincerely anna had meant to suffer she was not suffering shame there was not with the tact of which both had such a large share they had succeeded in avoiding russian ladies abroad and so had never placed themselves in a false position and everywhere they had met people who pretended that they perfectly understood their position far better indeed than they did themselves separation from the son she loved even that did not cause her anguish in these early days the baby girl his child was so sweet and had so won annas heart since
