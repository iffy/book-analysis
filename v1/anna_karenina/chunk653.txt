now and looked inquiringly at his former brother-in-law thats very true in particular cases but still the principle of our day is freedom yes but i lay down another principle embracing the principle of freedom said alexey alexandrovitch with emphasis on the word embracing and he put on his pince-nez again so as to read the passage in which this statement was made and turning over the beautifully written wide-margined manuscript alexey alexandrovitch read aloud over again the conclusive passage i dont advocate protection for the sake of private interests but for the public weal and for the lower and upper classes equally he said looking over his pince-nez at oblonsky but they cannot grasp that they are taken up now with personal interests and carried away by phrases stepan arkadyevitch knew that when karenin began to talk of what they were doing and thinking the persons who would not accept his report and were the cause of everything wrong in russia that it was coming near the end and so now he eagerly abandoned the principle of free-trade and fully agreed alexey alexandrovitch paused thoughtfully turning over the pages of his manuscript oh by the way said stepan arkadyevitch i wanted to ask you some time when you see pomorsky to drop him a hint that i should be very glad to get that new appointment of secretary of the committee of the amalgamated agency of the southern railways and banking companies stepan arkadyevitch was familiar by now with the title of the post he coveted and he brought it out rapidly without mistake alexey alexandrovitch questioned him as to the duties of this new committee and pondered he was considering whether the new committee would not be acting in some way contrary to the views he had been advocating but as the influence of the new committee was of a very complex nature and his views were of very wide application he could not decide this straight off and taking off his pince-nez he said of course i can mention it to him but what is your reason precisely for wishing to obtain the appointment its a good salary rising to nine thousand and my means nine thousand repeated alexey alexandrovitch and he frowned the high figure of the salary made him reflect that on that side stepan arkadyevitchs proposed position ran counter to the main tendency of his own projects of reform which always leaned towards economy i consider and i have embodied my views in a note on the subject that in our day these immense salaries are evidence of the unsound economic assiette of our finances but whats to be done said stepan arkadyevitch suppose a bank director gets ten thousand well hes worth it or an engineer gets twenty thousand after all its a growing thing you
