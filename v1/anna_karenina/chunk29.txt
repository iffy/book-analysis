princess shtcherbatskaya on thursdays we are home as always today then we shall be pleased to see you the princess said stiffly this stiffness hurt kitty and she could not resist the desire to smooth over her mothers coldness she turned her head and with a smile said good-bye till this evening at that moment stepan arkadyevitch his hat cocked on one side with beaming face and eyes strode into the garden like a conquering hero but as he approached his mother-in-law he responded in a mournful and crestfallen tone to her inquiries about dollys health after a little subdued and dejected conversation with his mother-in-law he threw out his chest again and put his arm in levins well shall we set off he asked ive been thinking about you all this time and im very very glad youve come he said looking him in the face with a significant air yes come along answered levin in ecstasy hearing unceasingly the sound of that voice saying good-bye till this evening and seeing the smile with which it was said to the england or the hermitage i dont mind which all right then the england said stepan arkadyevitch selecting that restaurant because he owed more there than at the hermitage and consequently considered it mean to avoid it have you got a sledge thats first-rate for i sent my carriage home the friends hardly spoke all the way levin was wondering what that change in kittys expression had meant and alternately assuring himself that there was hope and falling into despair seeing clearly that his hopes were insane and yet all the while he felt himself quite another man utterly unlike what he had been before her smile and those words good-bye till this evening stepan arkadyevitch was absorbed during the drive in composing the menu of the dinner you like turbot dont you he said to levin as they were arriving eh responded levin turbot yes im awfully fond of turbot chapter when levin went into the restaurant with oblonsky he could not help noticing a certain peculiarity of expression as it were a restrained radiance about the face and whole figure of stepan arkadyevitch oblonsky took off his overcoat and with his hat over one ear walked into the dining-room giving directions to the tatar waiters who were clustered about him in evening coats bearing napkins bowing to right and left to the people he met and here as everywhere joyously greeting acquaintances he went up to the sideboard for a preliminary appetizer of fish and vodka and said to the painted frenchwoman decked in ribbons lace and ringlets behind the counter something so amusing that even that frenchwoman was moved to genuine laughter levin for his part refrained from taking any vodka simply because he felt such a loathing of that frenchwoman
