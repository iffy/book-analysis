for two days and to beg her to be sure to send him a note next morning by a servant on horseback to write him if it were but two words only to let him know that all was well with her kitty was distressed as she always was at parting for a couple of days from her husband but when she saw his eager figure looking big and strong in his shooting-boots and his white blouse and a sort of sportsman elation and excitement incomprehensible to her she forgot her own chagrin for the sake of his pleasure and said good-bye to him cheerfully pardon gentlemen he said running out onto the steps have you put the lunch in why is the chestnut on the right well it doesnt matter laska down go and lie down put it with the herd of oxen he said to the herdsman who was waiting for him at the steps with some question excuse me here comes another villain levin jumped out of the wagonette in which he had already taken his seat to meet the carpenter who came towards the steps with a rule in his hand you didnt come to the counting house yesterday and now youre detaining me well what is it would your honor let me make another turning its only three steps to add and we make it just fit at the same time it will be much more convenient you should have listened to me levin answered with annoyance i said put the lines and then fit in the steps now theres no setting it right do as i told you and make a new staircase the point was that in the lodge that was being built the carpenter had spoiled the staircase fitting it together without calculating the space it was to fill so that the steps were all sloping when it was put in place now the carpenter wanted keeping the same staircase to add three steps it will be much better but wheres your staircase coming out with its three steps why upon my word sir the carpenter said with a contemptuous smile it comes out right at the very spot it starts so to speak he said with a persuasive gesture it comes down and comes down and comes out but three steps will add to the length too where is it to come out why to be sure itll start from the bottom and go up and go up and come out so the carpenter said obstinately and convincingly itll reach the ceiling and the wall upon my word why itll go up and up and come out like this levin took out a ramrod and began sketching him the staircase in the dust there do you see as your honor likes said the carpenter
