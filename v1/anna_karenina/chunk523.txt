shall see tomorrow oh yes we are going tomorrow chapter next day before the ladies were up the wagonette and a trap for the shooting party were at the door and laska aware since early morning that they were going shooting after much whining and darting to and fro had sat herself down in the wagonette beside the coachman and disapproving of the delay was excitedly watching the door from which the sportsmen still did not come out the first to come out was vassenka veslovsky in new high boots that reached half-way up his thick thighs in a green blouse with a new russian leather cartridge-belt and in his scotch cap with ribbons with a brand-new english gun without a sling laska flew up to him welcomed him and jumping up asked him in her own way whether the others were coming soon but getting no answer from him she returned to her post of observation and sank into repose again her head on one side and one ear pricked up to listen at last the door opened with a creak and stepan arkadyevitchs spot-and-tan pointer krak flew out running round and round and turning over in the air stepan arkadyevitch himself followed with a gun in his hand and a cigar in his mouth good dog good dog krak he cried encouragingly to the dog who put his paws up on his chest catching at his game bag stepan arkadyevitch was dressed in rough leggings and spats in torn trousers and a short coat on his head there was a wreck of a hat of indefinite form but his gun of a new patent was a perfect gem and his game bag and cartridge belt though worn were of the very best quality vassenka veslovsky had had no notion before that it was truly chic for a sportsman to be in tatters but to have his shooting outfit of the best quality he saw it now as he looked at stepan arkadyevitch radiant in his rags graceful well-fed and joyous a typical russian nobleman and he made up his mind that next time he went shooting he would certainly adopt the same get-up well and what about our host he asked a young wife said stepan arkadyevitch smiling yes and such a charming one he came down dressed no doubt hes run up to her again stepan arkadyevitch guessed right levin had run up again to his wife to ask her once more if she forgave him for his idiocy yesterday and moreover to beg her for christs sake to be more careful the great thing was for her to keep away from the children they might any minute push against her then he had once more to hear her declare that she was not angry with him for going away
