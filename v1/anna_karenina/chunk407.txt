red ground of the holy picture-stand and the gilt relief on the pictures and the silver of the lusters and candlesticks and the stones of the floor and the rugs and the banners above in the choir and the steps of the altar and the old blackened books and the cassocks and surplices all were flooded with light on the right side of the warm church in the crowd of frock coats and white ties uniforms and broadcloth velvet satin hair and flowers bare shoulders and arms and long gloves there was discreet but lively conversation that echoed strangely in the high cupola every time there was heard the creak of the opened door the conversation in the crowd died away and everybody looked round expecting to see the bride and bridegroom come in but the door had opened more than ten times and each time it was either a belated guest or guests who joined the circle of the invited on the right or a spectator who had eluded or softened the police officer and went to join the crowd of outsiders on the left both the guests and the outside public had by now passed through all the phases of anticipation at first they imagined that the bride and bridegroom would arrive immediately and attached no importance at all to their being late then they began to look more and more often towards the door and to talk of whether anything could have happened then the long delay began to be positively discomforting and relations and guests tried to look as if they were not thinking of the bridegroom but were engrossed in conversation the head deacon as though to remind them of the value of his time coughed impatiently making the window-panes quiver in their frames in the choir the bored choristers could be heard trying their voices and blowing their noses the priest was continually sending first the beadle and then the deacon to find out whether the bridegroom had not come more and more often he went himself in a lilac vestment and an embroidered sash to the side door expecting to see the bridegroom at last one of the ladies glancing at her watch said it really is strange though and all the guests became uneasy and began loudly expressing their wonder and dissatisfaction one of the bridegrooms best men went to find out what had happened kitty meanwhile had long ago been quite ready and in her white dress and long veil and wreath of orange blossoms she was standing in the drawing-room of the shtcherbatskys house with her sister madame lvova who was her bridal-mother she was looking out of the window and had been for over half an hour anxiously expecting to hear from the best man that her bridegroom was at the church
