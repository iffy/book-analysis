with its vases on pedestals and its open fireplaces its carved doors and gloomy reception rooms hung with pictures this palazzo did much by its very appearance after they had moved into it to confirm in vronsky the agreeable illusion that he was not so much a russian country gentleman a retired army officer as an enlightened amateur and patron of the arts himself a modest artist who had renounced the world his connections and his ambition for the sake of the woman he loved the pose chosen by vronsky with their removal into the palazzo was completely successful and having through golenishtchev made acquaintance with a few interesting people for a time he was satisfied he painted studies from nature under the guidance of an italian professor of painting and studied medival italian life medival italian life so fascinated vronsky that he even wore a hat and flung a cloak over his shoulder in the medival style which indeed was extremely becoming to him here we live and know nothing of whats going on vronsky said to golenishtchev as he came to see him one morning have you seen mihailovs picture he said handing him a russian gazette he had received that morning and pointing to an article on a russian artist living in the very same town and just finishing a picture which had long been talked about and had been bought beforehand the article reproached the government and the academy for letting so remarkable an artist be left without encouragement and support ive seen it answered golenishtchev of course hes not without talent but its all in a wrong direction its all the ivanov-strauss-renan attitude to christ and to religious painting what is the subject of the picture asked anna christ before pilate christ is represented as a jew with all the realism of the new school and the question of the subject of the picture having brought him to one of his favorite theories golenishtchev launched forth into a disquisition on it i cant understand how they can fall into such a gross mistake christ always has his definite embodiment in the art of the great masters and therefore if they want to depict not god but a revolutionist or a sage let them take from history a socrates a franklin a charlotte corday but not christ they take the very figure which cannot be taken for their art and then and is it true that this mihailov is in such poverty asked vronsky thinking that as a russian mcenas it was his duty to assist the artist regardless of whether the picture were good or bad i should say not hes a remarkable portrait-painter have you ever seen his portrait of madame vassiltchikova but i believe he doesnt care about painting any more portraits and so very likely
