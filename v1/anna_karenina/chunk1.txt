of light peeping in beside one of the serge curtains he cheerfully dropped his feet over the edge of the sofa and felt about with them for his slippers a present on his last birthday worked for him by his wife on gold-colored morocco and as he had done every day for the last nine years he stretched out his hand without getting up towards the place where his dressing-gown always hung in his bedroom and thereupon he suddenly remembered that he was not sleeping in his wifes room but in his study and why the smile vanished from his face he knitted his brows ah ah ah oo he muttered recalling everything that had happened and again every detail of his quarrel with his wife was present to his imagination all the hopelessness of his position and worst of all his own fault yes she wont forgive me and she cant forgive me and the most awful thing about it is that its all my fault all my fault though im not to blame thats the point of the whole situation he reflected oh oh oh he kept repeating in despair as he remembered the acutely painful sensations caused him by this quarrel most unpleasant of all was the first minute when on coming happy and good-humored from the theater with a huge pear in his hand for his wife he had not found his wife in the drawing-room to his surprise had not found her in the study either and saw her at last in her bedroom with the unlucky letter that revealed everything in her hand she his dolly forever fussing and worrying over household details and limited in her ideas as he considered was sitting perfectly still with the letter in her hand looking at him with an expression of horror despair and indignation whats this this she asked pointing to the letter and at this recollection stepan arkadyevitch as is so often the case was not so much annoyed at the fact itself as at the way in which he had met his wifes words there happened to him at that instant what does happen to people when they are unexpectedly caught in something very disgraceful he did not succeed in adapting his face to the position in which he was placed towards his wife by the discovery of his fault instead of being hurt denying defending himself begging forgiveness instead of remaining indifferent even anything would have been better than what he did do his face utterly involuntarily reflex spinal action reflected stepan arkadyevitch who was fond of physiology utterly involuntarily assumed its habitual good-humored and therefore idiotic smile this idiotic smile he could not forgive himself catching sight of that smile dolly shuddered as though at physical pain broke out with her characteristic heat into a flood
