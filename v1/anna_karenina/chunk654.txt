know i assume that a salary is the price paid for a commodity and it ought to conform with the law of supply and demand if the salary is fixed without any regard for that law as for instance when i see two engineers leaving college together both equally well trained and efficient and one getting forty thousand while the other is satisfied with two or when i see lawyers and hussars having no special qualifications appointed directors of banking companies with immense salaries i conclude that the salary is not fixed in accordance with the law of supply and demand but simply through personal interest and this is an abuse of great gravity in itself and one that reacts injuriously on the government service i consider stepan arkadyevitch made haste to interrupt his brother-in-law yes but you must agree that its a new institution of undoubted utility thats being started after all you know its a growing thing what they lay particular stress on is the thing being carried on honestly said stepan arkadyevitch with emphasis but the moscow significance of the word honest was lost on alexey alexandrovitch honesty is only a negative qualification he said well youll do me a great service anyway said stepan arkadyevitch by putting in a word to pomorsky just in the way of conversation but i fancy its more in volgarinovs hands said alexey alexandrovitch volgarinov has fully assented as far as hes concerned said stepan arkadyevitch turning red stepan arkadyevitch reddened at the mention of that name because he had been that morning at the jew volgarinovs and the visit had left an unpleasant recollection stepan arkadyevitch believed most positively that the committee in which he was trying to get an appointment was a new genuine and honest public body but that morning when volgarinov had intentionally beyond a doubt kept him two hours waiting with other petitioners in his waiting room he had suddenly felt uneasy whether he was uncomfortable that he a descendant of rurik prince oblonsky had been kept for two hours waiting to see a jew or that for the first time in his life he was not following the example of his ancestors in serving the government but was turning off into a new career anyway he was very uncomfortable during those two hours in volgarinovs waiting room stepan arkadyevitch stepping jauntily about the room pulling his whiskers entering into conversation with the other petitioners and inventing an epigram on his position assiduously concealed from others and even from himself the feeling he was experiencing but all the time he was uncomfortable and angry he could not have said why whether because he could not get his epigram just right or from some other reason when at last volgarinov had received him with exaggerated politeness and unmistakable triumph at
