like to race the horses with me the children knew levin very little and could not remember when they had seen him but they experienced in regard to him none of that strange feeling of shyness and hostility which children so often experience towards hypocritical grown-up people and for which they are so often and miserably punished hypocrisy in anything whatever may deceive the cleverest and most penetrating man but the least wide-awake of children recognizes it and is revolted by it however ingeniously it may be disguised whatever faults levin had there was not a trace of hypocrisy in him and so the children showed him the same friendliness that they saw in their mothers face on his invitation the two elder ones at once jumped out to him and ran with him as simply as they would have done with their nurse or miss hoole or their mother lily too began begging to go to him and her mother handed her to him he sat her on his shoulder and ran along with her dont be afraid dont be afraid darya alexandrovna he said smiling good-humoredly to the mother theres no chance of my hurting or dropping her and looking at his strong agile assiduously careful and needlessly wary movements the mother felt her mind at rest and smiled gaily and approvingly as she watched him here in the country with children and with darya alexandrovna with whom he was in sympathy levin was in a mood not infrequent with him of childlike light-heartedness that she particularly liked in him as he ran with the children he taught them gymnastic feats set miss hoole laughing with his queer english accent and talked to darya alexandrovna of his pursuits in the country after dinner darya alexandrovna sitting alone with him on the balcony began to speak of kitty you know kittys coming here and is going to spend the summer with me really he said flushing and at once to change the conversation he said then ill send you two cows shall i if you insist on a bill you shall pay me five roubles a month but its really too bad of you no thank you we can manage very well now oh well then ill have a look at your cows and if youll allow me ill give directions about their food everything depends on their food and levin to turn the conversation explained to darya alexandrovna the theory of cow-keeping based on the principle that the cow is simply a machine for the transformation of food into milk and so on he talked of this and passionately longed to hear more of kitty and at the same time was afraid of hearing it he dreaded the breaking up of the inward peace he had gained with such effort yes but
