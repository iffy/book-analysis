the grief of seeing signs of evil propensities in her children the children themselves were even now repaying her in small joys for her sufferings those joys were so small that they passed unnoticed like gold in sand and at bad moments she could see nothing but the pain nothing but sand but there were good moments too when she saw nothing but the joy nothing but gold now in the solitude of the country she began to be more and more frequently aware of those joys often looking at them she would make every possible effort to persuade herself that she was mistaken that she as a mother was partial to her children all the same she could not help saying to herself that she had charming children all six of them in different ways but a set of children such as is not often to be met with and she was happy in them and proud of them chapter towards the end of may when everything had been more or less satisfactorily arranged she received her husbands answer to her complaints of the disorganized state of things in the country he wrote begging her forgiveness for not having thought of everything before and promised to come down at the first chance this chance did not present itself and till the beginning of june darya alexandrovna stayed alone in the country on the sunday in st peters week darya alexandrovna drove to mass for all her children to take the sacrament darya alexandrovna in her intimate philosophical talks with her sister her mother and her friends very often astonished them by the freedom of her views in regard to religion she had a strange religion of transmigration of souls all her own in which she had firm faith troubling herself little about the dogmas of the church but in her family she was strict in carrying out all that was required by the church and not merely in order to set an example but with all her heart in it the fact that the children had not been at the sacrament for nearly a year worried her extremely and with the full approval and sympathy of marya philimonovna she decided that this should take place now in the summer for several days before darya alexandrovna was busily deliberating on how to dress all the children frocks were made or altered and washed seams and flounces were let out buttons were sewn on and ribbons got ready one dress tanyas which the english governess had undertaken cost darya alexandrovna much loss of temper the english governess in altering it had made the seams in the wrong place had taken up the sleeves too much and altogether spoilt the dress it was so narrow on tanyas shoulders that it was quite painful to look at
