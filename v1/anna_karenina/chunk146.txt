and the charm of studying such women chapter the place fixed on for the stand-shooting was not far above a stream in a little aspen copse on reaching the copse levin got out of the trap and led oblonsky to a corner of a mossy swampy glade already quite free from snow he went back himself to a double birch tree on the other side and leaning his gun on the fork of a dead lower branch he took off his full overcoat fastened his belt again and worked his arms to see if they were free gray old laska who had followed them sat down warily opposite him and pricked up her ears the sun was setting behind a thick forest and in the glow of sunset the birch trees dotted about in the aspen copse stood out clearly with their hanging twigs and their buds swollen almost to bursting from the thickest parts of the copse where the snow still remained came the faint sound of narrow winding threads of water running away tiny birds twittered and now and then fluttered from tree to tree in the pauses of complete stillness there came the rustle of last years leaves stirred by the thawing of the earth and the growth of the grass imagine one can hear and see the grass growing levin said to himself noticing a wet slate-colored aspen leaf moving beside a blade of young grass he stood listened and gazed sometimes down at the wet mossy ground sometimes at laska listening all alert sometimes at the sea of bare tree tops that stretched on the slope below him sometimes at the darkening sky covered with white streaks of cloud a hawk flew high over a forest far away with slow sweep of its wings another flew with exactly the same motion in the same direction and vanished the birds twittered more and more loudly and busily in the thicket an owl hooted not far off and laska starting stepped cautiously a few steps forward and putting her head on one side began to listen intently beyond the stream was heard the cuckoo twice she uttered her usual cuckoo call and then gave a hoarse hurried call and broke down imagine the cuckoo already said stepan arkadyevitch coming out from behind a bush yes i hear it answered levin reluctantly breaking the stillness with his voice which sounded disagreeable to himself now its coming stepan arkadyevitchs figure again went behind the bush and levin saw nothing but the bright flash of a match followed by the red glow and blue smoke of a cigarette tchk tchk came the snapping sound of stepan arkadyevitch cocking his gun whats that cry asked oblonsky drawing levins attention to a prolonged cry as though a colt were whinnying in a high voice in play
