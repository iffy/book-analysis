you and me but why so vronsky mentioned a few men who were in power why arent they independent men simply because they have not or have not had from birth an independent fortune theyve not had a name theyve not been close to the sun and center as we have they can be bought either by money or by favor and they have to find a support for themselves in inventing a policy and they bring forward some notion some policy that they dont believe in that does harm and the whole policy is really only a means to a government house and so much income cela nest pas plus fin que a when you get a peep at their cards i may be inferior to them stupider perhaps though i dont see why i should be inferior to them but you and i have one important advantage over them for certain in being more difficult to buy and such men are more needed than ever vronsky listened attentively but he was not so much interested by the meaning of the words as by the attitude of serpuhovskoy who was already contemplating a struggle with the existing powers and already had his likes and dislikes in that higher world while his own interest in the governing world did not go beyond the interests of his regiment vronsky felt too how powerful serpuhovskoy might become through his unmistakable faculty for thinking things out and for taking things in through his intelligence and gift of words so rarely met with in the world in which he moved and ashamed as he was of the feeling he felt envious still i havent the one thing of most importance for that he answered i havent the desire for power i had it once but its gone excuse me thats not true said serpuhovskoy smiling yes it is true it is true now vronsky added to be truthful yes its true now thats another thing but that now wont last forever perhaps answered vronsky you say perhaps serpuhovskoy went on as though guessing his thoughts but i say for certain and thats what i wanted to see you for your action was just what it should have been i see that but you ought not to keep it up i only ask you to give me carte blanche im not going to offer you my protection though indeed why shouldnt i protect you youve protected me often enough i should hope our friendship rises above all that sort of thing yes he said smiling to him as tenderly as a woman give me carte blanche retire from the regiment and ill draw you upwards imperceptibly but you must understand that i want nothing said vronsky except that all should be as it is serpuhovskoy got up and
