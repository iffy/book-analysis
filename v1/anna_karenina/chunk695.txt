vronsky had written carelessly yes thats what i expected she said to herself with an evil smile very good you can go home then she said softly addressing mihail she spoke softly because the rapidity of her hearts beating hindered her breathing no i wont let you make me miserable she thought menacingly addressing not him not herself but the power that made her suffer and she walked along the platform two maid-servants walking along the platform turned their heads staring at her and making some remarks about her dress real they said of the lace she was wearing the young men would not leave her in peace again they passed by peering into her face and with a laugh shouting something in an unnatural voice the station-master coming up asked her whether she was going by train a boy selling kvas never took his eyes off her my god where am i to go she thought going farther and farther along the platform at the end she stopped some ladies and children who had come to meet a gentleman in spectacles paused in their loud laughter and talking and stared at her as she reached them she quickened her pace and walked away from them to the edge of the platform a luggage train was coming in the platform began to sway and she fancied she was in the train again and all at once she thought of the man crushed by the train the day she had first met vronsky and she knew what she had to do with a rapid light step she went down the steps that led from the tank to the rails and stopped quite near the approaching train she looked at the lower part of the carriages at the screws and chains and the tall cast-iron wheel of the first carriage slowly moving up and trying to measure the middle between the front and back wheels and the very minute when that middle point would be opposite her there she said to herself looking into the shadow of the carriage at the sand and coal dust which covered the sleepers there in the very middle and i will punish him and escape from everyone and from myself she tried to fling herself below the wheels of the first carriage as it reached her but the red bag which she tried to drop out of her hand delayed her and she was too late she missed the moment she had to wait for the next carriage a feeling such as she had known when about to take the first plunge in bathing came upon her and she crossed herself that familiar gesture brought back into her soul a whole series of girlish and childish memories and suddenly the darkness that had covered everything for her was torn
