oh dont you know it thats the hare but enough talking listen its flying almost shrieked levin cocking his gun they heard a shrill whistle in the distance and in the exact time so well known to the sportsman two seconds later another a third and after the third whistle the hoarse guttural cry could be heard levin looked about him to right and to left and there just facing him against the dusky blue sky above the confused mass of tender shoots of the aspens he saw the flying bird it was flying straight towards him the guttural cry like the even tearing of some strong stuff sounded close to his ear the long beak and neck of the bird could be seen and at the very instant when levin was taking aim behind the bush where oblonsky stood there was a flash of red lightning the bird dropped like an arrow and darted upwards again again came the red flash and the sound of a blow and fluttering its wings as though trying to keep up in the air the bird halted stopped still an instant and fell with a heavy splash on the slushy ground can i have missed it shouted stepan arkadyevitch who could not see for the smoke here it is said levin pointing to laska who with one ear raised wagging the end of her shaggy tail came slowly back as though she would prolong the pleasure and as it were smiling brought the dead bird to her master well im glad you were successful said levin who at the same time had a sense of envy that he had not succeeded in shooting the snipe it was a bad shot from the right barrel responded stepan arkadyevitch loading his gun sh its flying the shrill whistles rapidly following one another were heard again two snipe playing and chasing one another and only whistling not crying flew straight at the very heads of the sportsmen there was the report of four shots and like swallows the snipe turned swift somersaults in the air and vanished from sight the stand-shooting was capital stepan arkadyevitch shot two more birds and levin two of which one was not found it began to get dark venus bright and silvery shone with her soft light low down in the west behind the birch trees and high up in the east twinkled the red lights of arcturus over his head levin made out the stars of the great bear and lost them again the snipe had ceased flying but levin resolved to stay a little longer till venus which he saw below a branch of birch should be above it and the stars of the great bear should be perfectly plain venus had risen above the branch and the ear of the great bear
