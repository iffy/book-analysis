a literature in which the old creeds do not even furnish matter for discussion but it is stated baldly that there is nothing else evolution natural selection struggle for existence and thats all in my article ive i tell you what said anna who had for a long while been exchanging wary glances with vronsky and knew that he was not in the least interested in the education of this artist but was simply absorbed by the idea of assisting him and ordering a portrait of him i tell you what she said resolutely interrupting golenishtchev who was still talking away lets go and see him golenishtchev recovered his self-possession and readily agreed but as the artist lived in a remote suburb it was decided to take the carriage an hour later anna with golenishtchev by her side and vronsky on the front seat of the carriage facing them drove up to a new ugly house in the remote suburb on learning from the porters wife who came out to them that mihailov saw visitors at his studio but that at that moment he was in his lodging only a couple of steps off they sent her to him with their cards asking permission to see his picture chapter the artist mihailov was as always at work when the cards of count vronsky and golenishtchev were brought to him in the morning he had been working in his studio at his big picture on getting home he flew into a rage with his wife for not having managed to put off the landlady who had been asking for money ive said it to you twenty times dont enter into details youre fool enough at all times and when you start explaining things in italian youre a fool three times as foolish he said after a long dispute dont let it run so long its not my fault if i had the money leave me in peace for gods sake mihailov shrieked with tears in his voice and stopping his ears he went off into his working room the other side of a partition wall and closed the door after him idiotic woman he said to himself sat down to the table and opening a portfolio he set to work at once with peculiar fervor at a sketch he had begun never did he work with such fervor and success as when things went ill with him and especially when he quarreled with his wife oh damn them all he thought as he went on working he was making a sketch for the figure of a man in a violent rage a sketch had been made before but he was dissatisfied with it no that one was better where is it he went back to his wife and scowling and not looking at her
