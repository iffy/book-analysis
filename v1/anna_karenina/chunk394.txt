had thought it all over hundreds of times and was convinced that a divorce was not at all simple as stepan arkadyevitch had said but was utterly impossible he did not believe a single word stepan arkadyevitch said to him to every word he had a thousand objections to make but he listened to him feeling that his words were the expression of that mighty brutal force which controlled his life and to which he would have to submit the only question is on what terms you agree to give her a divorce she does not want anything does not dare ask you for anything she leaves it all to your generosity my god my god what for thought alexey alexandrovitch remembering the details of divorce proceedings in which the husband took the blame on himself and with just the same gesture with which vronsky had done the same he hid his face for shame in his hands you are distressed i understand that but if you think it over whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also and if any man take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also thought alexey alexandrovitch yes yes he cried in a shrill voice i will take the disgrace on myself i will give up even my son but but wouldnt it be better to let it alone still you may do as you like and turning away so that his brother-in-law could not see him he sat down on a chair at the window there was bitterness there was shame in his heart but with bitterness and shame he felt joy and emotion at the height of his own meekness stepan arkadyevitch was touched he was silent for a space alexey alexandrovitch believe me she appreciates your generosity he said but it seems it was the will of god he added and as he said it felt how foolish a remark it was and with difficulty repressed a smile at his own foolishness alexey alexandrovitch would have made some reply but tears stopped him this is an unhappy fatality and one must accept it as such i accept the calamity as an accomplished fact and am doing my best to help both her and you said stepan arkadyevitch when he went out of his brother-in-laws room he was touched but that did not prevent him from being glad he had successfully brought the matter to a conclusion for he felt certain alexey alexandrovitch would not go back on his words to this satisfaction was added the fact that an idea had just struck him for a riddle turning on his successful achievement that when the affair was over he would ask his wife and most intimate friends he put this riddle into two or three different ways
