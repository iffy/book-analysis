room and seizing the first young lady he came across he began dancing himself chapter vronsky and kitty waltzed several times round the room after the first waltz kitty went to her mother and she had hardly time to say a few words to countess nordston when vronsky came up again for the first quadrille during the quadrille nothing of any significance was said there was disjointed talk between them of the korsunskys husband and wife whom he described very amusingly as delightful children at forty and of the future town theater and only once the conversation touched her to the quick when he asked her about levin whether he was here and added that he liked him so much but kitty did not expect much from the quadrille she looked forward with a thrill at her heart to the mazurka she fancied that in the mazurka everything must be decided the fact that he did not during the quadrille ask her for the mazurka did not trouble her she felt sure she would dance the mazurka with him as she had done at former balls and refused five young men saying she was engaged for the mazurka the whole ball up to the last quadrille was for kitty an enchanted vision of delightful colors sounds and motions she only sat down when she felt too tired and begged for a rest but as she was dancing the last quadrille with one of the tiresome young men whom she could not refuse she chanced to be vis--vis with vronsky and anna she had not been near anna again since the beginning of the evening and now again she saw her suddenly quite new and surprising she saw in her the signs of that excitement of success she knew so well in herself she saw that she was intoxicated with the delighted admiration she was exciting she knew that feeling and knew its signs and saw them in anna saw the quivering flashing light in her eyes and the smile of happiness and excitement unconsciously playing on her lips and the deliberate grace precision and lightness of her movements who she asked herself all or one and not assisting the harassed young man she was dancing with in the conversation the thread of which he had lost and could not pick up again she obeyed with external liveliness the peremptory shouts of korsunsky starting them all into the grand rond and then into the chane and at the same time she kept watch with a growing pang at her heart no its not the admiration of the crowd has intoxicated her but the adoration of one and that one can it be he every time he spoke to anna the joyous light flashed into her eyes and the smile of happiness curved her red lips
