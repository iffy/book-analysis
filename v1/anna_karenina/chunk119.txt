the conversation first of one and then of the other three people have used that very phrase about kaulbach to me today already just as though they had made a compact about it and i cant see why they liked that remark so the conversation was cut short by this observation and a new subject had to be thought of again do tell me something amusing but not spiteful said the ambassadors wife a great proficient in the art of that elegant conversation called by the english small talk she addressed the attach who was at a loss now what to begin upon they say that thats a difficult task that nothings amusing that isnt spiteful he began with a smile but ill try get me a subject it all lies in the subject if a subjects given me its easy to spin something round it i often think that the celebrated talkers of the last century would have found it difficult to talk cleverly now everything clever is so stale that has been said long ago the ambassadors wife interrupted him laughing the conversation began amiably but just because it was too amiable it came to a stop again they had to have recourse to the sure never-failing topic gossip dont you think theres something louis quinze about tushkevitch he said glancing towards a handsome fair-haired young man standing at the table oh yes hes in the same style as the drawing-room and thats why it is hes so often here this conversation was maintained since it rested on allusions to what could not be talked of in that room that is to say of the relations of tushkevitch with their hostess round the samovar and the hostess the conversation had been meanwhile vacillating in just the same way between three inevitable topics the latest piece of public news the theater and scandal it too came finally to rest on the last topic that is ill-natured gossip have you heard the maltishtcheva woman the mother not the daughter has ordered a costume in diable rose color nonsense no thats too lovely i wonder that with her sense for shes not a fool you know that she doesnt see how funny she is everyone had something to say in censure or ridicule of the luckless madame maltishtcheva and the conversation crackled merrily like a burning faggot-stack the husband of princess betsy a good-natured fat man an ardent collector of engravings hearing that his wife had visitors came into the drawing-room before going to his club stepping noiselessly over the thick rugs he went up to princess myakaya how did you like nilsson he asked oh how can you steal upon anyone like that how you startled me she responded please dont talk to me about the opera you know nothing about music id better
