vain and uncertain if not founded on observations of the seen heavens in relation to a single meridian and a single horizon so would my conclusions be vain and uncertain if not founded on that conception of right which has been and will be always alike for all men which has been revealed to me as a christian and which can always be trusted in my soul the question of other religions and their relations to divinity i have no right to decide and no possibility of deciding oh you havent gone in then he heard kittys voice all at once as she came by the same way to the drawing-room what is it youre not worried about anything she said looking intently at his face in the starlight but she could not have seen his face if a flash of lightning had not hidden the stars and revealed it in that flash she saw his face distinctly and seeing him calm and happy she smiled at him she understands he thought she knows what im thinking about shall i tell her or not yes ill tell her but at the moment he was about to speak she began speaking kostya do something for me she said go into the corner room and see if theyve made it all right for sergey ivanovitch i cant very well see if theyve put the new wash stand in it very well ill go directly said levin standing up and kissing her no id better not speak of it he thought when she had gone in before him it is a secret for me alone of vital importance for me and not to be put into words this new feeling has not changed me has not made me happy and enlightened all of a sudden as i had dreamed just like the feeling for my child there was no surprise in this either faith or not faith i dont know what it is but this feeling has come just as imperceptibly through suffering and has taken firm root in my soul i shall go on in the same way losing my temper with ivan the coachman falling into angry discussions expressing my opinions tactlessly there will be still the same wall between the holy of holies of my soul and other people even my wife i shall still go on scolding her for my own terror and being remorseful for it i shall still be as unable to understand with my reason why i pray and i shall still go on praying but my life now my whole life apart from anything that can happen to me every minute of it is no more meaningless as it was before but it has the positive meaning of goodness which i have the power to put into it
