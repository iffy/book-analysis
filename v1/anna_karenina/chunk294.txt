attained was that the work did not go to the liking of either side and that splendid tools splendid cattle and land were spoiled with no good to anyone worst of all the energy expended on this work was not simply wasted he could not help feeling now since the meaning of this system had become clear to him that the aim of his energy was a most unworthy one in reality what was the struggle about he was struggling for every farthing of his share and he could not help it for he had only to relax his efforts and he would not have had the money to pay his laborers wages while they were only struggling to be able to do their work easily and agreeably that is to say as they were used to doing it it was for his interests that every laborer should work as hard as possible and that while doing so he should keep his wits about him so as to try not to break the winnowing machines the horse rakes the thrashing machines that he should attend to what he was doing what the laborer wanted was to work as pleasantly as possible with rests and above all carelessly and heedlessly without thinking that summer levin saw this at every step he sent the men to mow some clover for hay picking out the worst patches where the clover was overgrown with grass and weeds and of no use for seed again and again they mowed the best acres of clover justifying themselves by the pretense that the bailiff had told them to and trying to pacify him with the assurance that it would be splendid hay but he knew that it was owing to those acres being so much easier to mow he sent out a hay machine for pitching the hay it was broken at the first row because it was dull work for a peasant to sit on the seat in front with the great wings waving above him and he was told dont trouble your honor sure the womenfolks will pitch it quick enough the ploughs were practically useless because it never occurred to the laborer to raise the share when he turned the plough and forcing it round he strained the horses and tore up the ground and levin was begged not to mind about it the horses were allowed to stray into the wheat because not a single laborer would consent to be night-watchman and in spite of orders to the contrary the laborers insisted on taking turns for night duty and ivan after working all day long fell asleep and was very penitent for his fault saying do what you will to me your honor they killed three of the best calves by letting them into the clover
