went into the horse-box dimly lighted by one little window in the horse-box stood a dark bay mare with a muzzle on picking at the fresh straw with her hoofs looking round him in the twilight of the horse-box vronsky unconsciously took in once more in a comprehensive glance all the points of his favorite mare frou-frou was a beast of medium size not altogether free from reproach from a breeders point of view she was small-boned all over though her chest was extremely prominent in front it was narrow her hind-quarters were a little drooping and in her fore-legs and still more in her hind-legs there was a noticeable curvature the muscles of both hind and fore-legs were not very thick but across her shoulders the mare was exceptionally broad a peculiarity specially striking now that she was lean from training the bones of her legs below the knees looked no thicker than a finger from in front but were extraordinarily thick seen from the side she looked altogether except across the shoulders as it were pinched in at the sides and pressed out in depth but she had in the highest degree the quality that makes all defects forgotten that quality was blood the blood that tells as the english expression has it the muscles stood up sharply under the network of sinews covered with the delicate mobile skin soft as satin and they were hard as bone her clean-cut head with prominent bright spirited eyes broadened out at the open nostrils that showed the red blood in the cartilage within about all her figure and especially her head there was a certain expression of energy and at the same time of softness she was one of those creatures which seem only not to speak because the mechanism of their mouth does not allow them to to vronsky at any rate it seemed that she understood all he felt at that moment looking at her directly vronsky went towards her she drew in a deep breath and turning back her prominent eye till the white looked bloodshot she started at the approaching figures from the opposite side shaking her muzzle and shifting lightly from one leg to the other there you see how fidgety she is said the englishman there darling there said vronsky going up to the mare and speaking soothingly to her but the nearer he came the more excited she grew only when he stood by her head she was suddenly quieter while the muscles quivered under her soft delicate coat vronsky patted her strong neck straightened over her sharp withers a stray lock of her mane that had fallen on the other side and moved his face near her dilated nostrils transparent as a bats wing she drew a loud breath and snorted out through her tense nostrils
