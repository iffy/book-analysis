and offered levin a drink what do you say to my home-brew eh good eh said he winking and truly levin had never drunk any liquor so good as this warm water with green bits floating in it and a taste of rust from the tin dipper and immediately after this came the delicious slow saunter with his hand on the scythe during which he could wipe away the streaming sweat take deep breaths of air and look about at the long string of mowers and at what was happening around in the forest and the country the longer levin mowed the oftener he felt the moments of unconsciousness in which it seemed not his hands that swung the scythe but the scythe mowing of itself a body full of life and consciousness of its own and as though by magic without thinking of it the work turned out regular and well-finished of itself these were the most blissful moments it was only hard work when he had to break off the motion which had become unconscious and to think when he had to mow round a hillock or a tuft of sorrel the old man did this easily when a hillock came he changed his action and at one time with the heel and at another with the tip of his scythe clipped the hillock round both sides with short strokes and while he did this he kept looking about and watching what came into his view at one moment he picked a wild berry and ate it or offered it to levin then he flung away a twig with the blade of the scythe then he looked at a quails nest from which the bird flew just under the scythe or caught a snake that crossed his path and lifting it on the scythe as though on a fork showed it to levin and threw it away for both levin and the young peasant behind him such changes of position were difficult both of them repeating over and over again the same strained movement were in a perfect frenzy of toil and were incapable of shifting their position and at the same time watching what was before them levin did not notice how time was passing if he had been asked how long he had been working he would have said half an hour and it was getting on for dinner time as they were walking back over the cut grass the old man called levins attention to the little girls and boys who were coming from different directions hardly visible through the long grass and along the road towards the mowers carrying sacks of bread dragging at their little hands and pitchers of the sour rye-beer with cloths wrapped round them lookee the little emmets crawling he said pointing to them
