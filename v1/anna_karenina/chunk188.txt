she was in an agony of terror for vronsky but a still greater agony was the never-ceasing as it seemed to her stream of her husbands shrill voice with its familiar intonations im a wicked woman a lost woman she thought but i dont like lying i cant endure falsehood while as for him her husband its the breath of his life falsehood he knows all about it he sees it all what does he care if he can talk so calmly if he were to kill me if he were to kill vronsky i might respect him no all he wants is falsehood and propriety anna said to herself not considering exactly what it was she wanted of her husband and how she would have liked to see him behave she did not understand either that alexey alexandrovitchs peculiar loquacity that day so exasperating to her was merely the expression of his inward distress and uneasiness as a child that has been hurt skips about putting all his muscles into movement to drown the pain in the same way alexey alexandrovitch needed mental exercise to drown the thoughts of his wife that in her presence and in vronskys and with the continual iteration of his name would force themselves on his attention and it was as natural for him to talk well and cleverly as it is natural for a child to skip about he was saying danger in the races of officers of cavalry men is an essential element in the race if england can point to the most brilliant feats of cavalry in military history it is simply owing to the fact that she has historically developed this force both in beasts and in men sport has in my opinion a great value and as is always the case we see nothing but what is most superficial its not superficial said princess tverskaya one of the officers they say has broken two ribs alexey alexandrovitch smiled his smile which uncovered his teeth but revealed nothing more well admit princess that thats not superficial he said but internal but thats not the point and he turned again to the general with whom he was talking seriously we mustnt forget that those who are taking part in the race are military men who have chosen that career and one must allow that every calling has its disagreeable side it forms an integral part of the duties of an officer low sports such as prize-fighting or spanish bull-fights are a sign of barbarity but specialized trials of skill are a sign of development no i shant come another time its too upsetting said princess betsy isnt it anna it is upsetting but one cant tear oneself away said another lady if id been a roman woman i should never have missed a single circus
