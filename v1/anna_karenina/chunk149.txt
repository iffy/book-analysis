in six years ive been bothering about it for ever so long no one would give more then youve as good as given away your forest for nothing said levin gloomily how do you mean for nothing said stepan arkadyevitch with a good-humored smile knowing that nothing would be right in levins eyes now because the forest is worth at least a hundred and fifty roubles the acre answered levin oh these farmers said stepan arkadyevitch playfully your tone of contempt for us poor townsfolk but when it comes to business we do it better than anyone i assure you i have reckoned it all out he said and the forest is fetching a very good price so much so that im afraid of this fellows crying off in fact you know its not timber said stepan arkadyevitch hoping by this distinction to convince levin completely of the unfairness of his doubts and it wont run to more than twenty-five yards of fagots per acre and hes giving me at the rate of seventy roubles the acre levin smiled contemptuously i know he thought that fashion not only in him but in all city people who after being twice in ten years in the country pick up two or three phrases and use them in season and out of season firmly persuaded that they know all about it timber run to so many yards the acre he says those words without understanding them himself i wouldnt attempt to teach you what you write about in your office said he and if need arose i should come to you to ask about it but youre so positive you know all the lore of the forest its difficult have you counted the trees how count the trees said stepan arkadyevitch laughing still trying to draw his friend out of his ill-temper count the sands of the sea number the stars some higher power might do it oh well the higher power of ryabinin can not a single merchant ever buys a forest without counting the trees unless they get it given them for nothing as youre doing now i know your forest i go there every year shooting and your forests worth a hundred and fifty roubles an acre paid down while hes giving you sixty by installments so that in fact youre making him a present of thirty thousand come dont let your imagination run away with you said stepan arkadyevitch piteously why was it none would give it then why because he has an understanding with the merchants hes bought them off ive had to do with all of them i know them theyre not merchants you know theyre speculators he wouldnt look at a bargain that gave him ten fifteen per cent profit but holds back to buy a roubles worth for twenty
