stepping into a new life and she did not want to speak of it to vulgarize this feeling by inappropriate words but later too and the next day and the third day she still found no words in which she could express the complexity of her feelings indeed she could not even find thoughts in which she could clearly think out all that was in her soul she said to herself no just now i cant think of it later on when i am calmer but this calm for thought never came every time the thought rose of what she had done and what would happen to her and what she ought to do a horror came over her and she drove those thoughts away later later she said when i am calmer but in dreams when she had no control over her thoughts her position presented itself to her in all its hideous nakedness one dream haunted her almost every night she dreamed that both were her husbands at once that both were lavishing caresses on her alexey alexandrovitch was weeping kissing her hands and saying how happy we are now and alexey vronsky was there too and he too was her husband and she was marveling that it had once seemed impossible to her was explaining to them laughing that this was ever so much simpler and that now both of them were happy and contented but this dream weighed on her like a nightmare and she awoke from it in terror chapter in the early days after his return from moscow whenever levin shuddered and grew red remembering the disgrace of his rejection he said to himself this was just how i used to shudder and blush thinking myself utterly lost when i was plucked in physics and did not get my remove and how i thought myself utterly ruined after i had mismanaged that affair of my sisters that was entrusted to me and yet now that years have passed i recall it and wonder that it could distress me so much it will be the same thing too with this trouble time will go by and i shall not mind about this either but three months had passed and he had not left off minding about it and it was as painful for him to think of it as it had been those first days he could not be at peace because after dreaming so long of family life and feeling himself so ripe for it he was still not married and was further than ever from marriage he was painfully conscious himself as were all about him that at his years it is not well for man to be alone he remembered how before starting for moscow he had once said to his cowman nikolay a simple-hearted peasant
