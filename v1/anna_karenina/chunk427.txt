asked his eldest little girl where was that piece of paper he had given them the paper with the discarded sketch on it was found but it was dirty and spotted with candle-grease still he took the sketch laid it on his table and moving a little away screwing up his eyes he fell to gazing at it all at once he smiled and gesticulated gleefully thats it thats it he said and at once picking up the pencil he began rapidly drawing the spot of tallow had given the man a new pose he had sketched this new pose when all at once he recalled the face of a shopkeeper of whom he had bought cigars a vigorous face with a prominent chin and he sketched this very face this chin on to the figure of the man he laughed aloud with delight the figure from a lifeless imagined thing had become living and such that it could never be changed that figure lived and was clearly and unmistakably defined the sketch might be corrected in accordance with the requirements of the figure the legs indeed could and must be put differently and the position of the left hand must be quite altered the hair too might be thrown back but in making these corrections he was not altering the figure but simply getting rid of what concealed the figure he was as it were stripping off the wrappings which hindered it from being distinctly seen each new feature only brought out the whole figure in all its force and vigor as it had suddenly come to him from the spot of tallow he was carefully finishing the figure when the cards were brought him coming coming he went in to his wife come sasha dont be cross he said smiling timidly and affectionately at her you were to blame i was to blame ill make it all right and having made peace with his wife he put on an olive-green overcoat with a velvet collar and a hat and went towards his studio the successful figure he had already forgotten now he was delighted and excited at the visit of these people of consequence russians who had come in their carriage of his picture the one that stood now on his easel he had at the bottom of his heart one conviction that no one had ever painted a picture like it he did not believe that his picture was better than all the pictures of raphael but he knew that what he tried to convey in that picture no one ever had conveyed this he knew positively and had known a long while ever since he had begun to paint it but other peoples criticisms whatever they might be had yet immense consequence in his eyes and they agitated him
