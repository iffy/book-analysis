i cannot in any case agree with keiss that my whole conception of the external world has been derived from perceptions the most fundamental idea the idea of existence has not been received by me through sensation indeed there is no special sense-organ for the transmission of such an idea yes but they wurt and knaust and pripasov would answer that your consciousness of existence is derived from the conjunction of all your sensations that that consciousness of existence is the result of your sensations wurt indeed says plainly that assuming there are no sensations it follows that there is no idea of existence i maintain the contrary began sergey ivanovitch but here it seemed to levin that just as they were close upon the real point of the matter they were again retreating and he made up his mind to put a question to the professor according to that if my senses are annihilated if my body is dead i can have no existence of any sort he queried the professor in annoyance and as it were mental suffering at the interruption looked round at the strange inquirer more like a bargeman than a philosopher and turned his eyes upon sergey ivanovitch as though to ask whats one to say to him but sergey ivanovitch who had been talking with far less heat and one-sidedness than the professor and who had sufficient breadth of mind to answer the professor and at the same time to comprehend the simple and natural point of view from which the question was put smiled and said that question we have no right to answer as yet we have not the requisite data chimed in the professor and he went back to his argument no he said i would point out the fact that if as pripasov directly asserts perception is based on sensation then we are bound to distinguish sharply between these two conceptions levin listened no more and simply waited for the professor to go chapter when the professor had gone sergey ivanovitch turned to his brother delighted that youve come for some time is it hows your farming getting on levin knew that his elder brother took little interest in farming and only put the question in deference to him and so he only told him about the sale of his wheat and money matters levin had meant to tell his brother of his determination to get married and to ask his advice he had indeed firmly resolved to do so but after seeing his brother listening to his conversation with the professor hearing afterwards the unconsciously patronizing tone in which his brother questioned him about agricultural matters their mothers property had not been divided and levin took charge of both their shares levin felt that he could not for some reason begin to talk
