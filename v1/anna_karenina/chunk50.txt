late just as with dolly well well we wont talk of it the princess stopped him recollecting her unlucky dolly by all means and good-night and signing each other with the cross the husband and wife parted with a kiss feeling that they each remained of their own opinion the princess had at first been quite certain that that evening had settled kittys future and that there could be no doubt of vronskys intentions but her husbands words had disturbed her and returning to her own room in terror before the unknown future she too like kitty repeated several times in her heart lord have pity lord have pity lord have pity chapter vronsky had never had a real home life his mother had been in her youth a brilliant society woman who had had during her married life and still more afterwards many love affairs notorious in the whole fashionable world his father he scarcely remembered and he had been educated in the corps of pages leaving the school very young as a brilliant officer he had at once got into the circle of wealthy petersburg army men although he did go more or less into petersburg society his love affairs had always hitherto been outside it in moscow he had for the first time felt after his luxurious and coarse life at petersburg all the charm of intimacy with a sweet and innocent girl of his own rank who cared for him it never even entered his head that there could be any harm in his relations with kitty at balls he danced principally with her he was a constant visitor at their house he talked to her as people commonly do talk in society all sorts of nonsense but nonsense to which he could not help attaching a special meaning in her case although he said nothing to her that he could not have said before everybody he felt that she was becoming more and more dependent upon him and the more he felt this the better he liked it and the tenderer was his feeling for her he did not know that his mode of behavior in relation to kitty had a definite character that it is courting young girls with no intention of marriage and that such courting is one of the evil actions common among brilliant young men such as he was it seemed to him that he was the first who had discovered this pleasure and he was enjoying his discovery if he could have heard what her parents were saying that evening if he could have put himself at the point of view of the family and have heard that kitty would be unhappy if he did not marry her he would have been greatly astonished and would not have believed it he could not believe
