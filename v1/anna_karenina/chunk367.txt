moment a ring was heard yegor departed and levin was left alone he had eaten scarcely anything at dinner had refused tea and supper at sviazhskys but he was incapable of thinking of supper he had not slept the previous night but was incapable of thinking of sleep either his room was cold but he was oppressed by heat he opened both the movable panes in his window and sat down to the table opposite the open panes over the snow-covered roofs could be seen a decorated cross with chains and above it the rising triangle of charless wain with the yellowish light of capella he gazed at the cross then at the stars drank in the fresh freezing air that flowed evenly into the room and followed as though in a dream the images and memories that rose in his imagination at four oclock he heard steps in the passage and peeped out at the door it was the gambler myaskin whom he knew coming from the club he walked gloomily frowning and coughing poor unlucky fellow thought levin and tears came into his eyes from love and pity for this man he would have talked with him and tried to comfort him but remembering that he had nothing but his shirt on he changed his mind and sat down again at the open pane to bathe in the cold air and gaze at the exquisite lines of the cross silent but full of meaning for him and the mounting lurid yellow star at seven oclock there was a noise of people polishing the floors and bells ringing in some servants department and levin felt that he was beginning to get frozen he closed the pane washed dressed and went out into the street chapter the streets were still empty levin went to the house of the shtcherbatskys the visitors doors were closed and everything was asleep he walked back went into his room again and asked for coffee the day servant not yegor this time brought it to him levin would have entered into conversation with him but a bell rang for the servant and he went out levin tried to drink coffee and put some roll in his mouth but his mouth was quite at a loss what to do with the roll levin rejecting the roll put on his coat and went out again for a walk it was nine oclock when he reached the shtcherbatskys steps the second time in the house they were only just up and the cook came out to go marketing he had to get through at least two hours more all that night and morning levin lived perfectly unconsciously and felt perfectly lifted out of the conditions of material life he had eaten nothing for a whole day he had not slept for
