the doctor a sickly-looking man have you been there i went there but i had taken flight the doctor answered with gloomy jocoseness then youve taken a good constitutional splendid well and how was the old woman i hope its not typhus typhus it is not but its taking a bad turn what a pity said anna and having thus paid the dues of civility to her domestic circle she turned to her own friends it would be a hard task though to construct a machine from your description anna arkadyevna sviazhsky said jestingly oh no why so said anna with a smile that betrayed that she knew there was something charming in her disquisitions upon the machine that had been noticed by sviazhsky this new trait of girlish coquettishness made an unpleasant impression on dolly but anna arkadyevnas knowledge of architecture is marvelous said tushkevitch to be sure i heard anna arkadyevna talking yesterday about plinths and damp-courses said veslovsky have i got it right theres nothing marvelous about it when one sees and hears so much of it said anna but i dare say you dont even know what houses are made of darya alexandrovna saw that anna disliked the tone of raillery that existed between her and veslovsky but fell in with it against her will vronsky acted in this matter quite differently from levin he obviously attached no significance to veslovskys chattering on the contrary he encouraged his jests come now tell us veslovsky how are the stones held together by cement of course bravo and what is cement oh some sort of paste no putty said veslovsky raising a general laugh the company at dinner with the exception of the doctor the architect and the steward who remained plunged in gloomy silence kept up a conversation that never paused glancing off one subject fastening on another and at times stinging one or the other to the quick once darya alexandrovna felt wounded to the quick and got so hot that she positively flushed and wondered afterwards whether she had said anything extreme or unpleasant sviazhsky began talking of levin describing his strange view that machinery is simply pernicious in its effects on russian agriculture i have not the pleasure of knowing this m levin vronsky said smiling but most likely he has never seen the machines he condemns or if he has seen and tried any it must have been after a queer fashion some russian imitation not a machine from abroad what sort of views can anyone have on such a subject turkish views in general veslovsky said turning to anna with a smile i cant defend his opinions darya alexandrovna said firing up but i can say that hes a highly cultivated man and if he were here he would know very well how to answer
