smiles were as soothing and softening as almond oil and anna soon felt this no stiva she said im lost lost worse than lost i cant say yet that all is over on the contrary i feel that its not over im an overstrained string that must snap but its not ended yet and it will have a fearful end no matter we must let the string be loosened little by little theres no position from which there is no way of escape i have thought and thought only one again he knew from her terrified eyes that this one way of escape in her thought was death and he would not let her say it not at all he said listen to me you cant see your own position as i can let me tell you candidly my opinion again he smiled discreetly his almond-oil smile ill begin from the beginning you married a man twenty years older than yourself you married him without love and not knowing what love was it was a mistake lets admit a fearful mistake said anna but i repeat its an accomplished fact then you had let us say the misfortune to love a man not your husband that was a misfortune but that too is an accomplished fact and your husband knew it and forgave it he stopped at each sentence waiting for her to object but she made no answer thats so now the question is can you go on living with your husband do you wish it does he wish it i know nothing nothing but you said yourself that you cant endure him no i didnt say so i deny it i cant tell i dont know anything about it yes but let you cant understand i feel im lying head downwards in a sort of pit but i ought not to save myself and i cant never mind well slip something under and pull you out i understand you i understand that you cant take it on yourself to express your wishes your feelings theres nothing nothing i wish except for it to be all over but he sees this and knows it and do you suppose it weighs on him any less than on you youre wretched hes wretched and what good can come of it while divorce would solve the difficulty completely with some effort stepan arkadyevitch brought out his central idea and looked significantly at her she said nothing and shook her cropped head in dissent but from the look in her face that suddenly brightened into its old beauty he saw that if she did not desire this it was simply because it seemed to her unattainable happiness im awfully sorry for you and how happy i should be if i could arrange things said stepan arkadyevitch
