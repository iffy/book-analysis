own wants and nothing else like mituh he only thinks of filling his belly but fokanitch is a righteous man he lives for his soul he does not forget god how thinks of god how does he live for his soul levin almost shouted why to be sure in truth in gods way folks are different take you now you wouldnt wrong a man yes yes good-bye said levin breathless with excitement and turning round he took his stick and walked quickly away towards home at the peasants words that fokanitch lived for his soul in truth in gods way undefined but significant ideas seemed to burst out as though they had been locked up and all striving towards one goal they thronged whirling through his head blinding him with their light chapter levin strode along the highroad absorbed not so much in his thoughts he could not yet disentangle them as in his spiritual condition unlike anything he had experienced before the words uttered by the peasant had acted on his soul like an electric shock suddenly transforming and combining into a single whole the whole swarm of disjointed impotent separate thoughts that incessantly occupied his mind these thoughts had unconsciously been in his mind even when he was talking about the land he was aware of something new in his soul and joyfully tested this new thing not yet knowing what it was not living for his own wants but for god for what god and could one say anything more senseless than what he said he said that one must not live for ones own wants that is that one must not live for what we understand what we are attracted by what we desire but must live for something incomprehensible for god whom no one can understand nor even define what of it didnt i understand those senseless words of fyodors and understanding them did i doubt of their truth did i think them stupid obscure inexact no i understood him and exactly as he understands the words i understood them more fully and clearly than i understand anything in life and never in my life have i doubted nor can i doubt about it and not only i but everyone the whole world understands nothing fully but this and about this only they have no doubt and are always agreed and i looked out for miracles complained that i did not see a miracle which would convince me a material miracle would have persuaded me and here is a miracle the sole miracle possible continually existing surrounding me on all sides and i never noticed it fyodor says that kirillov lives for his belly thats comprehensible and rational all of us as rational beings cant do anything else but live for our belly and all of a sudden
