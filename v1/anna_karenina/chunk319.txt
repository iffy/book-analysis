angry with himself for so base a feeling levin ran into the hall as soon as he had seen his brother close this feeling of selfish disappointment vanished instantly and was replaced by pity terrible as his brother nikolay had been before in his emaciation and sickliness now he looked still more emaciated still more wasted he was a skeleton covered with skin he stood in the hall jerking his long thin neck and pulling the scarf off it and smiled a strange and pitiful smile when he saw that smile submissive and humble levin felt something clutching at his throat you see ive come to you said nikolay in a thick voice never for one second taking his eyes off his brothers face ive been meaning to a long while but ive been unwell all the time now im ever so much better he said rubbing his beard with his big thin hands yes yes answered levin and he felt still more frightened when kissing him he felt with his lips the dryness of his brothers skin and saw close to him his big eyes full of a strange light a few weeks before konstantin levin had written to his brother that through the sale of the small part of the property that had remained undivided there was a sum of about two thousand roubles to come to him as his share nikolay said that he had come now to take this money and what was more important to stay a while in the old nest to get in touch with the earth so as to renew his strength like the heroes of old for the work that lay before him in spite of his exaggerated stoop and the emaciation that was so striking from his height his movements were as rapid and abrupt as ever levin led him into his study his brother dressed with particular care a thing he never used to do combed his scanty lank hair and smiling went upstairs he was in the most affectionate and good-humored mood just as levin often remembered him in childhood he even referred to sergey ivanovitch without rancor when he saw agafea mihalovna he made jokes with her and asked after the old servants the news of the death of parfen denisitch made a painful impression on him a look of fear crossed his face but he regained his serenity immediately of course he was quite old he said and changed the subject well ill spend a month or two with you and then im off to moscow do you know myakov has promised me a place there and im going into the service now im going to arrange my life quite differently he went on you know i got rid of that woman marya nikolaevna why what for oh she
