thy trust avoiding profane and vain babblings and oppositions of science falsely so called which some professing have erred concerning the faith grace be with thee amen the second epistle of paul the apostle to timothy paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god according to the promise of life which is in christ jesus to timothy my dearly beloved son grace mercy and peace from god the father and christ jesus our lord i thank god whom i serve from my forefathers with pure conscience that without ceasing i have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day greatly desiring to see thee being mindful of thy tears that i may be filled with joy when i call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee which dwelt first in thy grandmother lois and thy mother eunice and i am persuaded that in thee also wherefore i put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of god which is in thee by the putting on of my hands for god hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord nor of me his prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of god who hath saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in christ jesus before the world began but is now made manifest by the appearing of our saviour jesus christ who hath abolished death and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel whereunto i am appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the gentiles for the which cause i also suffer these things nevertheless i am not ashamed for i know whom i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which i have committed unto him against that day hold fast the form of sound words which thou hast heard of me in faith and love which is in christ jesus that good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the holy ghost which dwelleth in us this thou knowest that all they which are in asia be turned away from me of whom are phygellus and hermogenes the lord give mercy unto the house of onesiphorus for he oft refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain but when he was in rome he sought me out very diligently and found me the lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the lord in that day and in how many things he ministered unto me at ephesus thou knowest very well thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus and the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ no man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier and if a man also strive for masteries yet is he not crowned except he strive lawfully the husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits consider what i say and the lord give thee understanding in all things remember that jesus christ of the seed of david was raised from the dead according to my gospel wherein i suffer trouble as an evil doer even unto bonds but the word of god is not bound therefore i endure all things for the elects sakes that they may also obtain the salvation which is in christ jesus with eternal glory it is a faithful saying for if we be dead with him we shall also live with him if we suffer we shall also reign with him if we deny him he also will deny us if we believe not yet he abideth faithful he cannot deny himself of these things put them in remembrance charging them before the lord that they strive not about words to no profit but to the subverting of the hearers study to shew thyself approved unto god a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth but shun profane and vain babblings for they will increase unto more ungodliness and their word will eat as doth a canker of whom is hymenaeus and philetus who concerning the truth have erred saying that the resurrection is past already and overthrow the faith of some nevertheless the foundation of god standeth sure having this seal the lord knoweth them that are his and let every one that nameth the name of christ depart from iniquity but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and of earth and some to honour and some to dishonour if a man therefore purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honour sanctified and meet for the masters use and prepared unto every good work flee also youthful lusts but follow righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart but foolish and unlearned questions avoid knowing that they do gender strifes and the servant of the lord must not strive but be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves if god peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him at his will this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection trucebreakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady highminded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away for of this sort are they which creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins led
