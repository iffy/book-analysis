in thee o lord do i hope thou wilt hear o lord my god for i said hear me lest otherwise they should rejoice over me when my foot slippeth they magnify themselves against me for i am ready to halt and my sorrow is continually before me for i will declare mine iniquity i will be sorry for my sin but mine enemies are lively and they are strong and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied they also that render evil for good are mine adversaries because i follow the thing that good is forsake me not o lord o my god be not far from me make haste to help me o lord my salvation i said i will take heed to my ways that i sin not with my tongue i will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before me i was dumb with silence i held my peace even from good and my sorrow was stirred my heart was hot within me while i was musing the fire burned then spake i with my tongue lord make me to know mine end and the measure of my days what it is that i may know how frail i am behold thou hast made my days as an handbreadth and mine age is as nothing before thee verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity selah surely every man walketh in a vain shew surely they are disquieted in vain he heapeth up riches and knoweth not who shall gather them and now lord what wait i for my hope is in thee deliver me from all my transgressions make me not the reproach of the foolish i was dumb i opened not my mouth because thou didst it remove thy stroke away from me i am consumed by the blow of thine hand when thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth surely every man is vanity selah hear my prayer o lord and give ear unto my cry hold not thy peace at my tears for i am a stranger with thee and a sojourner as all my fathers were o spare me that i may recover strength before i go hence and be no more i waited patiently for the lord and he inclined unto me and heard my cry he brought me up also out of an horrible pit out of the miry clay and set my feet upon a rock and established my goings and he hath put a new song in my mouth even praise unto our god many shall see it and fear and shall trust in the lord blessed is that man that maketh the lord his trust and respecteth not the proud nor such as turn aside to lies many o lord my god are thy wonderful works which thou hast done and thy thoughts which are to us-ward they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee if i would declare and speak of them they are more than can be numbered sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire mine ears hast thou opened burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is written of me i delight to do thy will o my god yea thy law is within my heart i have preached righteousness in the great congregation lo i have not refrained my lips o lord thou knowest i have not hid thy righteousness within my heart i have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation i have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me o lord let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me for innumerable evils have compassed me about mine iniquities have taken hold upon me so that i am not able to look up they are more than the hairs of mine head therefore my heart faileth me be pleased o lord to deliver me o lord make haste to help me let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me aha aha let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee let such as love thy salvation say continually the lord be magnified but i am poor and needy yet the lord thinketh upon me thou art my help and my deliverer make no tarrying o my god blessed is he that considereth the poor the lord will deliver him in time of trouble the lord will preserve him and keep him alive and he shall be blessed upon the earth and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies the lord will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness i said lord be merciful unto me heal my soul for i have sinned against thee mine enemies speak evil of me when shall he die and his name perish and if he come to see me he speaketh vanity his heart gathereth iniquity to itself when he goeth abroad he telleth it all that hate me whisper together against me against me do they devise my hurt an evil disease say they cleaveth fast unto him and now that he lieth he shall rise up no more yea mine own familiar friend in whom i trusted which did eat of my bread hath lifted up his heel against me but thou o lord be merciful unto me and raise me up that i may requite them by this i know that thou favourest me because mine enemy doth not triumph over me and as for me thou upholdest me in mine integrity and settest me before thy face for ever blessed be the lord god of israel from everlasting and to everlasting amen and amen as the hart panteth after the water brooks so panteth my soul after thee o god my soul thirsteth for god for the living god when shall i come and appear before god my tears have been my meat day
