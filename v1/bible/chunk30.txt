us hereby shall i know that ye are true men leave one of your brethren here with me and take food for the famine of your households and be gone and bring your youngest brother unto me then shall i know that ye are no spies but that ye are true men so will i deliver you your brother and ye shall traffick in the land and it came to pass as they emptied their sacks that behold every mans bundle of money was in his sack and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money they were afraid and jacob their father said unto them me have ye bereaved of my children joseph is not and simeon is not and ye will take benjamin away all these things are against me and reuben spake unto his father saying slay my two sons if i bring him not to thee deliver him into my hand and i will bring him to thee again and he said my son shall not go down with you for his brother is dead and he is left alone if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave and the famine was sore in the land and it came to pass when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of egypt their father said unto them go again buy us a little food and judah spake unto him saying the man did solemnly protest unto us saying ye shall not see my face except your brother be with you if thou wilt send our brother with us we will go down and buy thee food but if thou wilt not send him we will not go down for the man said unto us ye shall not see my face except your brother be with you and israel said wherefore dealt ye so ill with me as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother and they said the man asked us straitly of our state and of our kindred saying is your father yet alive have ye another brother and we told him according to the tenor of these words could we certainly know that he would say bring your brother down and judah said unto israel his father send the lad with me and we will arise and go that we may live and not die both we and thou and also our little ones i will be surety for him of my hand shalt thou require him if i bring him not unto thee and set him before thee then let me bear the blame for ever for except we had lingered surely now we had returned this second time and their father israel said unto them if it must be so now do this take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels and carry down the man a present a little balm and a little honey spices and myrrh nuts and almonds and take double money in your hand and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks carry it again in your hand peradventure it was an oversight take also your brother and arise go again unto the man and god almighty give you mercy before the man that he may send away your other brother and benjamin if i be bereaved of my children i am bereaved and the men took that present and they took double money in their hand and benjamin and rose up and went down to egypt and stood before joseph and when joseph saw benjamin with them he said to the ruler of his house bring these men home and slay and make ready for these men shall dine with me at noon and the man did as joseph bade and the man brought the men into josephs house and the men were afraid because they were brought into josephs house and they said because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in that he may seek occasion against us and fall upon us and take us for bondmen and our asses and they came near to the steward of josephs house and they communed with him at the door of the house and said o sir we came indeed down at the first time to buy food and it came to pass when we came to the inn that we opened our sacks and behold every mans money was in the mouth of his sack our money in full weight and we have brought it again in our hand and other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks and he said peace be to you fear not your god and the god of your father hath given you treasure in your sacks i had your money and he brought simeon out unto them and the man brought the men into josephs house and gave them water and they washed their feet and he gave their asses provender and they made ready the present against joseph came at noon for they heard that they should eat bread there and when joseph came home they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house and bowed themselves to him to the earth and he asked them of their welfare and said is your father well the old man of whom ye spake is he yet alive and they answered thy servant our father is in good health he is yet alive and they bowed down their heads and made obeisance and he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother benjamin his mothers son and said is this your younger brother of whom ye spake unto me and he said god be gracious unto thee my son and joseph made haste for his bowels did yearn upon his brother and he sought where to weep and he entered into his chamber and wept there and he washed his face and went out and refrained himself and said set on bread and they set on for him by himself and for them by themselves and for the egyptians
