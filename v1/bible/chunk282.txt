come upon them over against the mulberry trees and it shall be when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees that then thou shalt go out to battle for god is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the philistines david therefore did as god commanded him and they smote the host of the philistines from gibeon even to gazer and the fame of david went out into all lands and the lord brought the fear of him upon all nations and david made him houses in the city of david and prepared a place for the ark of god and pitched for it a tent then david said none ought to carry the ark of god but the levites for them hath the lord chosen to carry the ark of god and to minister unto him for ever and david gathered all israel together to jerusalem to bring up the ark of the lord unto his place which he had prepared for it and david assembled the children of aaron and the levites of the sons of kohath uriel the chief and his brethren an hundred and twenty of the sons of merari asaiah the chief and his brethren two hundred and twenty of the sons of gershom joel the chief and his brethren an hundred and thirty of the sons of elizaphan shemaiah the chief and his brethren two hundred of the sons of hebron eliel the chief and his brethren fourscore of the sons of uzziel amminadab the chief and his brethren an hundred and twelve and david called for zadok and abiathar the priests and for the levites for uriel asaiah and joel shemaiah and eliel and amminadab and said unto them ye are the chief of the fathers of the levites sanctify yourselves both ye and your brethren that ye may bring up the ark of the lord god of israel unto the place that i have prepared for it for because ye did it not at the first the lord our god made a breach upon us for that we sought him not after the due order so the priests and the levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the lord god of israel and the children of the levites bare the ark of god upon their shoulders with the staves thereon as moses commanded according to the word of the lord and david spake to the chief of the levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick psalteries and harps and cymbals sounding by lifting up the voice with joy so the levites appointed heman the son of joel and of his brethren asaph the son of berechiah and of the sons of merari their brethren ethan the son of kushaiah and with them their brethren of the second degree zechariah ben and jaaziel and shemiramoth and jehiel and unni eliab and benaiah and maaseiah and mattithiah and elipheleh and mikneiah and obededom and jeiel the porters so the singers heman asaph and ethan were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass and zechariah and aziel and shemiramoth and jehiel and unni and eliab and maaseiah and benaiah with psalteries on alamoth and mattithiah and elipheleh and mikneiah and obededom and jeiel and azaziah with harps on the sheminith to excel and chenaniah chief of the levites was for song he instructed about the song because he was skilful and berechiah and elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark and shebaniah and jehoshaphat and nethaneel and amasai and zechariah and benaiah and eliezer the priests did blow with the trumpets before the ark of god and obededom and jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark so david and the elders of israel and the captains over thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord out of the house of obededom with joy and it came to pass when god helped the levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the lord that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams and david was clothed with a robe of fine linen and all the levites that bare the ark and the singers and chenaniah the master of the song with the singers david also had upon him an ephod of linen thus all israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the lord with shouting and with sound of the cornet and with trumpets and with cymbals making a noise with psalteries and harps and it came to pass as the ark of the covenant of the lord came to the city of david that michal the daughter of saul looking out at a window saw king david dancing and playing and she despised him in her heart so they brought the ark of god and set it in the midst of the tent that david had pitched for it and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before god and when david had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings he blessed the people in the name of the lord and he dealt to every one of israel both man and woman to every one a loaf of bread and a good piece of flesh and a flagon of wine and he appointed certain of the levites to minister before the ark of the lord and to record and to thank and praise the lord god of israel asaph the chief and next to him zechariah jeiel and shemiramoth and jehiel and mattithiah and eliab and benaiah and obededom and jeiel with psalteries and with harps but asaph made a sound with cymbals benaiah also and jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of god then on that day david delivered first this psalm to thank the lord into the hand of asaph and his brethren give thanks unto the lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the people sing unto him sing psalms unto him talk ye of all his wondrous works glory ye in his holy name let the heart of them rejoice that seek the lord seek the lord and his strength seek his face continually remember his marvellous works that he hath done his wonders and the judgments of his mouth o ye seed
