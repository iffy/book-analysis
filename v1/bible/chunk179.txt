him hold thy peace lay thine hand upon thy mouth and go with us and be to us a father and a priest is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in israel and the priests heart was glad and he took the ephod and the teraphim and the graven image and went in the midst of the people so they turned and departed and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them and when they were a good way from the house of micah the men that were in the houses near to micahs house were gathered together and overtook the children of dan and they cried unto the children of dan and they turned their faces and said unto micah what aileth thee that thou comest with such a company and he said ye have taken away my gods which i made and the priest and ye are gone away and what have i more and what is this that ye say unto me what aileth thee and the children of dan said unto him let not thy voice be heard among us lest angry fellows run upon thee and thou lose thy life with the lives of thy household and the children of dan went their way and when micah saw that they were too strong for him he turned and went back unto his house and they took the things which micah had made and the priest which he had and came unto laish unto a people that were at quiet and secure and they smote them with the edge of the sword and burnt the city with fire and there was no deliverer because it was far from zidon and they had no business with any man and it was in the valley that lieth by bethrehob and they built a city and dwelt therein and they called the name of the city dan after the name of dan their father who was born unto israel howbeit the name of the city was laish at the first and the children of dan set up the graven image and jonathan the son of gershom the son of manasseh he and his sons were priests to the tribe of dan until the day of the captivity of the land and they set them up micahs graven image which he made all the time that the house of god was in shiloh and it came to pass in those days when there was no king in israel that there was a certain levite sojourning on the side of mount ephraim who took to him a concubine out of bethlehemjudah and his concubine played the whore against him and went away from him unto her fathers house to bethlehemjudah and was there four whole months and her husband arose and went after her to speak friendly unto her and to bring her again having his servant with him and a couple of asses and she brought him into her fathers house and when the father of the damsel saw him he rejoiced to meet him and his father in law the damsels father retained him and he abode with him three days so they did eat and drink and lodged there and it came to pass on the fourth day when they arose early in the morning that he rose up to depart and the damsels father said unto his son in law comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread and afterward go your way and they sat down and did eat and drink both of them together for the damsels father had said unto the man be content i pray thee and tarry all night and let thine heart be merry and when the man rose up to depart his father in law urged him therefore he lodged there again and he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart and the damsels father said comfort thine heart i pray thee and they tarried until afternoon and they did eat both of them and when the man rose up to depart he and his concubine and his servant his father in law the damsels father said unto him behold now the day draweth toward evening i pray you tarry all night behold the day groweth to an end lodge here that thine heart may be merry and to morrow get you early on your way that thou mayest go home but the man would not tarry that night but he rose up and departed and came over against jebus which is jerusalem and there were with him two asses saddled his concubine also was with him and when they were by jebus the day was far spent and the servant said unto his master come i pray thee and let us turn in into this city of the jebusites and lodge in it and his master said unto him we will not turn

lodge in gibeah and when he went in he sat him down in a street of the city for there was no man that took them into his house to lodging and behold there came an old man from his work out of the field at even which was also of mount ephraim and he sojourned in gibeah but the men of the place were benjamites and when he had lifted up his eyes he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city and the old man said whither goest thou and whence comest thou and he said unto him we are passing from bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount ephraim from thence am i and i went to bethlehemjudah but i am now going to the house of the lord and
