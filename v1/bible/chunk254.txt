said o thou man of god there is death in the pot and they could not eat thereof but he said then bring meal and he cast it into the pot and he said pour out for the people that they may eat and there was no harm in the pot and there came a man from baalshalisha and brought the man of god bread of the firstfruits twenty loaves of barley and full ears of corn in the husk thereof and he said give unto the people that they may eat and his servitor said what should i set this before an hundred men he said again give the people that they may eat for thus saith the lord they shall eat and shall leave thereof so he set it before them and they did eat and left thereof according to the word of the lord now naaman captain of the host of the king of syria was a great man with his master and honourable because by him the lord had given deliverance unto syria he was also a mighty man in valour but he was a leper and the syrians had gone out by companies and had brought away captive out of the land of israel a little maid and she waited on naamans wife and she said unto her mistress would god my lord were with the prophet that is in samaria for he would recover him of his leprosy and one went in and told his lord saying thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of israel and the king of syria said go to go and i will send a letter unto the king of israel and he departed and took with him ten talents of silver and six thousand pieces of gold and ten changes of raiment and he brought the letter to the king of israel saying now when this letter is come unto thee behold i have therewith sent naaman my servant to thee that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy and it came to pass when the king of israel had read the letter that he rent his clothes and said am i god to kill and to make alive that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy wherefore consider i pray you and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me and it was so when elisha the man of god had heard that the king of israel had rent his clothes that he sent to the king saying wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes let him come now to me and he shall know that there is a prophet in israel so naaman came with his horses and with his chariot and stood at the door of the house of elisha and elisha sent a messenger unto him saying go and wash in jordan seven times and thy flesh shall come again to thee and thou shalt be clean but naaman was wroth and went away and said behold i thought he will surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the lord his god and strike his hand over the place and recover the leper are not abana and pharpar rivers of damascus better than all the waters of israel may i not wash in them and be clean so he turned and went away in a rage and his servants came near and spake unto him and said my father if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing wouldest thou not have done it how much rather then when he saith to thee wash and be clean then went he down and dipped himself seven times in jordan according to the saying of the man of god and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child and he was clean and he returned to the man of god he and all his company and came and stood before him and he said behold now i know that there is no god in all the earth but in israel now therefore i pray thee take a blessing of thy servant but he said as the lord liveth before whom i stand i will receive none and he urged him to take it but he refused and naaman said shall there not then i pray thee be given to thy servant two mules burden of earth for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods but unto the lord in this thing the lord pardon thy servant that when my master goeth into the house of rimmon to worship there and he leaneth on my hand and i bow myself in the house of rimmon when i bow down myself in the house of rimmon the lord pardon thy servant in this thing and he said unto him go in peace so he departed from him a little way but gehazi the servant of elisha the man of god said behold my master hath spared naaman this syrian in not receiving at his hands that which he brought but as the lord liveth i will run after him and take somewhat of him so gehazi followed after naaman and when naaman saw him running after him he lighted down from the chariot to meet him and said is all well and he said all is well my master hath sent me saying behold even now there be come to me from mount ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets give them i pray thee a talent of silver and two changes of garments and naaman said be content take two talents and he urged him and bound two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of garments and laid them upon two of his servants and they bare them before him and when he came to the tower he took them from their hand and bestowed them in the house and he let the men go and they departed but he went in and stood before his master and elisha said unto him whence comest thou gehazi and he said thy servant went no whither and he said unto him went not mine heart with thee when the man turned again from his chariot
