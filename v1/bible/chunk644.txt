if ye love me keep my commandments and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you for ever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because i live ye shall live also at that day ye shall know that i am in my father and ye in me and i in you he that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him judas saith unto him not iscariot lord how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which ye hear is not mine but the fathers which sent me these things have i spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid ye have heard how i said unto you i go away and come again unto you if ye loved me ye would rejoice because i said i go unto the father for my father is greater than i and now i have told you before it come to pass that when it is come to pass ye might believe hereafter i will not talk much with you for the prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me but that the world may know that i love the father and as the father gave me commandment even so i do arise let us go hence i am the true vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit now ye are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples as the father hath loved me so have i loved you continue ye in my love if ye keep my commandments ye shall abide in my love even as i have kept my fathers commandments and abide in his love these things have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full this is my commandment that ye love one another as i have loved you greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever i command you henceforth i call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth but i have called you friends for all things that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he may give it you these things i command you that ye love one another if the world hate you ye know that it hated me before it hated you if ye were of the world the world would love his own but because ye are not of the world but i have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hateth you remember the word that i said unto you the servant is not greater than his lord if they have persecuted me they will also persecute you if they have kept my saying they will keep yours also but all these things will they do unto you for my names sake because they know not him that sent me if i had not come and spoken unto them they had not had sin but now they have no cloak for their sin he that hateth me hateth my father also if i had not done among them the works which none other man did they had not had sin but now have they both seen and hated both me and my father but this cometh to pass that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law they hated me without a cause but when the comforter is come whom i will send unto you from the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me and ye also shall bear witness because ye have been with me from the beginning these things have i spoken unto you that ye should not be offended they shall put you out of the synagogues yea the time cometh that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth god service and these things will they do
