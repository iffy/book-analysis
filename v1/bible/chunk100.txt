his tent and the anger of the lord was kindled greatly moses also was displeased and moses said unto the lord wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant and wherefore have i not found favour in thy sight that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me have i conceived all this people have i begotten them that thou shouldest say unto me carry them in thy bosom as a nursing father beareth the sucking child unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers whence should i have flesh to give unto all this people for they weep unto me saying give us flesh that we may eat i am not able to bear all this people alone because it is too heavy for me and if thou deal thus with me kill me i pray thee out of hand if i have found favour in thy sight and let me not see my wretchedness and the lord said unto moses gather unto me seventy men of the elders of israel whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people and officers over them and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation that they may stand there with thee and i will come down and talk with thee there and i will take of the spirit which is upon thee and will put it upon them and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee that thou bear it not thyself alone and say thou unto the people sanctify yourselves against to morrow and ye shall eat flesh for ye have wept in the ears of the lord saying who shall give us flesh to eat for it was well with us in egypt therefore the lord will give you flesh and ye shall eat ye shall not eat one day nor two days nor five days neither ten days nor twenty days but even a whole month until it come out at your nostrils and it be loathsome unto you because that ye have despised the lord which is among you and have wept before him saying why came we forth out of egypt and moses said the people among whom i am are six hundred thousand footmen and thou hast said i will give them flesh that they may eat a whole month shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them to suffice them or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them to suffice them and the lord said unto moses is the lords hand waxed short thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not and moses went out and told the people the words of the lord and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people and set them round about the tabernacle and the lord came down in a cloud and spake unto him and took of the spirit that was upon him and gave it unto the seventy elders and it came to pass that when the spirit rested upon them they prophesied and did not cease but there remained two of the men in the camp the name of the one was eldad and the name of the other medad and the spirit rested upon them and they were of them that were written but went not out unto the tabernacle and they prophesied in the camp and there ran a young man and told moses and said eldad and medad do prophesy in the camp and joshua the son of nun the servant of moses one of his young men answered and said my lord moses forbid them and moses said unto him enviest thou for my sake would god that all the lords people were prophets and that the lord would put his spirit upon them and moses gat him into the camp he and the elders of israel and there went forth a wind from the lord and brought quails from the sea and let them fall by the camp as it were a days journey on this side and as it were a days journey on the other side round about the camp and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth and the people stood up all that day and all that night and all the next day and they gathered the quails he that gathered least gathered ten homers and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp and while the flesh was yet between their teeth ere it was chewed the wrath of the lord was kindled against the people and the lord smote the people with a very great plague and he called the name of that place kibrothhattaavah because there they buried the people that lusted and the people journeyed from kibrothhattaavah unto hazeroth and abode at hazeroth and miriam and aaron spake against moses because of the ethiopian woman whom he had married for he had married an ethiopian woman and they said hath the lord indeed spoken only by moses hath he not spoken also by us and the lord heard it now the man moses was very meek above all the men which were upon the face of the earth and the lord spake suddenly unto moses and unto aaron and unto miriam come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation and they three came out and the lord came down in the pillar of the cloud and stood in the door of the tabernacle and called aaron and miriam and they both came forth and he said hear now my words if there be a prophet among you i the lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and will speak unto him in a dream my servant moses is not so who is faithful in all mine house with him will i speak mouth to mouth even apparently and not in dark speeches and the similitude of the lord shall he behold wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant moses and the anger of the lord was kindled against them and he departed and the cloud departed from off the tabernacle and behold miriam became leprous white as snow and aaron looked upon miriam and behold she was leprous and aaron
