meant it unto good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive now therefore fear ye not i will nourish you and your little ones and he comforted them and spake kindly unto them and joseph dwelt in egypt he and his fathers house and joseph lived an hundred and ten years and joseph saw ephraims children of the third generation the children also of machir the son of manasseh were brought up upon josephs knees and joseph said unto his brethren i die and god will surely visit you and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to abraham to isaac and to jacob and joseph took an oath of the children of israel saying god will surely visit you and ye shall carry up my bones from hence so joseph died being an hundred and ten years old and they embalmed him and he was put in a coffin in egypt the second book of moses called exodus now these are the names of the children of israel which came into egypt every man and his household came with jacob reuben simeon levi and judah issachar zebulun and benjamin dan and naphtali gad and asher and all the souls that came out of the loins of jacob were seventy souls for joseph was in egypt already and joseph died and all his brethren and all that generation and the children of israel were fruitful and increased abundantly and multiplied and waxed exceeding mighty and the land was filled with them now there arose up a new king over egypt which knew not joseph and he said unto his people behold the people of the children of israel are more and mightier than we come on let us deal wisely with them lest they multiply and it come to pass that when there falleth out any war they join also unto our enemies and fight against us and so get them up out of the land therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens and they built for pharaoh treasure cities pithom and raamses but the more they afflicted them the more they multiplied and grew and they were grieved because of the children of israel and the egyptians made the children of israel to serve with rigour and they made their lives bitter with hard bondage in morter and in brick and in all manner of service in the field all their service wherein they made them serve was with rigour and the king of egypt spake to the hebrew midwives of which the name of the one was shiphrah and the name of the other puah and he said when ye do the office of a midwife to the hebrew women and see them upon the stools if it be a son then ye shall kill him but if it be a daughter then she shall live but the midwives feared god and did not as the king of egypt commanded them but saved the men children alive and the king of egypt called for the midwives and said unto them why have ye done this thing and have saved the men children alive and the midwives said unto pharaoh because the hebrew women are not as the egyptian women for they are lively and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them therefore god dealt well with the midwives and the people multiplied and waxed very mighty and it came to pass because the midwives feared god that he made them houses and pharaoh charged all his people saying every son that is born ye shall cast into the river and every daughter ye shall save alive and there went a man of the house of levi and took to wife a daughter of levi and the woman conceived and bare a son and when she saw him that he was a goodly child she hid him three months and when she could not longer hide him she took for him an ark of bulrushes and daubed it with slime and with pitch and put the child therein and she laid it in the flags by the rivers brink and his sister stood afar off to wit what would be done to him and the daughter of pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river and her maidens walked along by the rivers side and when she saw the ark among the flags she sent her maid to fetch it and when she had opened it she saw the child and behold the babe wept and she had compassion on him and said this is one of the hebrews children then said his sister to pharaohs daughter shall i go and call to thee a nurse of the hebrew women that she may nurse the child for thee and pharaohs daughter said to her go and the maid went and called the childs mother and pharaohs daughter said unto her take this child away and nurse it for me and i will give thee thy wages and the

and it came to pass in those days when moses was grown that he went out unto his brethren and looked on their burdens and he spied an egyptian smiting an hebrew one of his brethren and he looked this way and that way and when he saw that there was no man he slew the egyptian and hid him in the sand and when he went out the second day behold two men of the hebrews strove together and he said to him that did the wrong wherefore smitest thou thy fellow and he said who made thee a prince and a judge over us intendest thou to kill me as thou killedst the egyptian and moses feared and said surely
