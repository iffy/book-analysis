was brought up with me as with a father and i have guided her from my mothers womb if i have seen any perish for want of clothing or any poor without covering if his loins have not blessed me and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep if i have lifted up my hand against the fatherless when i saw my help in the gate then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade and mine arm be broken from the bone for destruction from god was a terror to me and by reason of his highness i could not endure if i have made gold my hope or have said to the fine gold thou art my confidence if i rejoice because my wealth was great and because mine hand had gotten much if i beheld the sun when it shined or the moon walking in brightness and my heart hath been secretly enticed or my mouth hath kissed my hand this also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge for i should have denied the god that is above if i rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me or lifted up myself when evil found him neither have i suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul if the men of my tabernacle said not oh that we had of his flesh we cannot be satisfied the stranger did not lodge in the street but i opened my doors to the traveller if i covered my transgressions as adam by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom did i fear a great multitude or did the contempt of families terrify me that i kept silence and went not out of the door oh that one would hear me behold my desire is that the almighty would answer me and that mine adversary had written a book surely i would take it upon my shoulder and bind it as a crown to me i would declare unto him the number of my steps as a prince would i go near unto him if my land cry against me or that the furrows likewise thereof complain if i have eaten the fruits thereof without money or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life let thistles grow instead of wheat and cockle instead of barley the words of job are ended so these three men ceased to answer job because he was righteous in his own eyes then was kindled the wrath of elihu the son of barachel the buzite of the kindred of ram against job was his wrath kindled because he justified himself rather than god also against his three friends was his wrath kindled because they had found no answer and yet had condemned job now elihu had waited till job had spoken because they were elder than he when elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men then his wrath was kindled and elihu the son of barachel the buzite answered and said i am young and ye are very old wherefore i was afraid and durst not shew you mine opinion i said days should speak and multitude of years should teach wisdom but there is a spirit in man and the inspiration of the almighty giveth them understanding great men are not always wise neither do the aged understand judgment therefore i said hearken to me i also will shew mine opinion behold i waited for your words i gave ear to your reasons whilst ye searched out what to say yea i attended unto you and behold there was none of you that convinced job or that answered his words lest ye should say we have found out wisdom god thrusteth him down not man now he hath not directed his words against me neither will i answer him with your speeches they were amazed they answered no more they left off speaking when i had waited for they spake not but stood still and answered no more i said i will answer also my part i also will shew mine opinion for i am full of matter the spirit within me constraineth me behold my belly is as wine which hath no vent it is ready to burst like new bottles i will speak that i may be refreshed i will open my lips and answer let me not i pray you accept any mans person neither let me give flattering titles unto man for i know not to give flattering titles in so doing my maker would soon take me away wherefore job i pray thee hear my speeches and hearken to all my words behold now i have opened my mouth my tongue hath spoken in my mouth my words shall be of the uprightness of my heart and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly the spirit of god hath made me and the

will answer thee that god is greater than man why dost thou strive against him for he giveth not account of any of his matters for god speaketh once yea twice yet man perceiveth it not in a dream in a vision of the night when deep sleep falleth upon men in slumberings upon the bed then he openeth the ears of men and sealeth their instruction that he may withdraw man from his purpose and hide pride
