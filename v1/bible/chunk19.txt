that he was rebekahs son and she ran and told her father and it came to pass when laban heard the tidings of jacob his sisters son that he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house and he told laban all these things and laban said to him surely thou art my bone and my flesh and he abode with him the space of a month and laban said unto jacob because thou art my brother shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought tell me what shall thy wages be and laban had two daughters the name of the elder was leah and the name of the younger was rachel leah was tender eyed but rachel was beautiful and well favoured and jacob loved rachel and said i will serve thee seven years for rachel thy younger daughter and laban said it is better that i give her to thee than that i should give her to another man abide with me and jacob served seven years for rachel and they seemed unto him but a few days for the love he had to her and jacob said unto laban give me my wife for my days are fulfilled that i may go in unto her and laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast and it came to pass in the evening that he took leah his daughter and brought her to him and he went in unto her and laban gave unto his daughter leah zilpah his maid for an handmaid and it came to pass that in the morning behold it was leah and he said to laban what is this thou hast done unto me did not i serve with thee for rachel wherefore then hast thou beguiled me and laban said it must not be so done in our country to give the younger before the firstborn fulfil her week and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years and jacob did so and fulfilled her week and he gave him rachel his daughter to wife also and laban gave to rachel his daughter bilhah his handmaid to be her maid and he went in also unto rachel and he loved also rachel more than leah and served with him yet seven other years and when the lord saw that leah was hated he opened her womb but rachel was barren and leah conceived and bare a son and she called his name reuben for she said surely the lord hath looked upon my affliction now therefore my husband will love me and she conceived again and bare a son and said because the lord hath heard i was hated he hath therefore given me this son also and she called his name simeon and she conceived again and bare a son and said now this time will my husband be joined unto me because i have born him three sons therefore was his name called levi and she conceived again and bare a son and she said now will i praise the lord therefore she called his name judah and left bearing and when rachel saw that she bare jacob no children rachel envied her sister and said unto jacob give me children or else i die and jacobs anger was kindled against rachel and he said am i in gods stead who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb and she said behold my maid bilhah go in unto her and she shall bear upon my knees that i may also have children by her and she gave him bilhah her handmaid to wife and jacob went in unto her and bilhah conceived and bare jacob a son and rachel said god hath judged me and hath also heard my voice and hath given me a son therefore called she his name dan and bilhah rachels maid conceived again and bare jacob a second son and rachel said with great wrestlings have i wrestled with my sister and i have prevailed and she called his name naphtali when leah saw that she had left bearing she took zilpah her maid and gave her jacob to wife and zilpah leahs maid bare jacob a son and leah said a troop cometh and she called his name gad and zilpah leahs maid bare jacob a second son and leah said happy am i for the daughters will call me blessed and she called his name asher and reuben went in the days of wheat harvest and found mandrakes in the field and brought them unto his mother leah then rachel said to leah give me i pray thee of thy sons mandrakes and she said unto her is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband and wouldest thou take away my sons mandrakes also and rachel said therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy sons mandrakes and jacob came out of the field in the evening and leah went out to meet him and said thou must come in unto me for surely i have hired thee with my sons mandrakes and he lay with her that night and god hearkened unto leah and she conceived and bare jacob the fifth son and leah said god hath given me my hire because i have given my maiden to my husband and she called his name issachar and leah conceived again and bare jacob the sixth son and leah said god hath endued me with a good dowry now will my husband dwell with me because i have born him six sons and she called his name zebulun and afterwards she bare a daughter and called her name dinah and god remembered rachel and god hearkened to her and opened her womb and she conceived and bare a son and said god hath taken away my reproach and she called his name joseph and said the lord shall add to me another son and it came to pass when rachel had born joseph that jacob said unto laban send me away that i may go unto mine own place and to my country give me my wives and my children for whom i have served thee and let me go for thou
