day that i smote every firstborn in the land of egypt i sanctified them for myself and i have taken the levites for all the firstborn of the children of israel and i have given the levites as a gift to aaron and to his sons from among the children of israel to do the service of the children of israel in the tabernacle of the congregation and to make an atonement for the children of israel that there be no plague among the children of israel when the children of israel come nigh unto the sanctuary and moses and aaron and all the congregation of the children of israel did to the levites according unto all that the lord commanded moses concerning the levites so did the children of israel unto them and the levites were purified and they washed their clothes and aaron offered them as an offering before the lord and aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them and after that went the levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before aaron and before his sons as the lord had commanded moses concerning the levites so did they unto them and the lord spake unto moses saying this is it that belongeth unto the levites from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the congregation and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the service thereof and shall serve no more but shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation to keep the charge and shall do no service thus shalt thou do unto the levites touching their charge and the lord spake unto moses in the wilderness of sinai in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of egypt saying let the children of israel also keep the passover at his appointed season in the fourteenth day of this month at even ye shall keep it in his appointed season according to all the rites of it and according to all the ceremonies thereof shall ye keep it and moses spake unto the children of israel that they should keep the passover and they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of sinai according to all that the lord commanded moses so did the children of israel and there were certain men who were defiled by the dead body of a man that they could not keep the passover on that day and they came before moses and before aaron on that day and those men said unto him we are defiled by the dead body of a man wherefore are we kept back that we may not offer an offering of the lord in his appointed season among the children of israel and moses said unto them stand still and i will hear what the lord will command concerning you and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel saying if any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body or be in a journey afar off yet he shall keep the passover unto the lord the fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs they shall leave none of it unto the morning nor break any bone of it according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it but the man that is clean and is not in a journey and forbeareth to keep the passover even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people because he brought not the offering of the lord in his appointed season that man shall bear his sin and if a stranger shall sojourn among you and will keep the passover unto the lord according to the ordinance of the passover and according to the manner thereof so shall he do ye shall have one ordinance both for the stranger and for him that was born in the land and on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle namely the tent of the testimony and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire until the morning so it was alway the cloud covered it by day and the appearance of fire by night and when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle then after that the children of israel journeyed and in the place where the cloud abode there the children of israel pitched their tents at the commandment of the lord the children of israel journeyed and at the commandment of the lord they pitched as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents and when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days then the children of israel kept the charge of the lord and journeyed not and so it was when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle according to the commandment of the lord they abode in their tents and according to the commandment of the lord they journeyed and so it was when the cloud abode from even unto the morning and that the cloud was taken up in the morning then they journeyed whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up they journeyed or whether it were two days or a month or a year that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle remaining thereon the children of israel abode in their tents and journeyed not but when it was taken up they journeyed at the commandment of the lord they rested in the tents and at the commandment of the lord they journeyed they kept the charge of the lord at the commandment of the lord by the hand of moses and the lord spake unto moses saying make thee two trumpets of silver of a whole piece shalt thou make them that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly and for the journeying of the camps and when they shall blow with them all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door
