heaven and returneth not thither but watereth the earth and maketh it bring forth and bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto i sent it for ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree and it shall be to the lord for a name for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off thus saith the lord keep ye judgment and do justice for my salvation is near to come and my righteousness to be revealed blessed is the man that doeth this and the son of man that layeth hold on it that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it and keepeth his hand from doing any evil neither let the son of the stranger that hath joined himself to the lord speak saying the lord hath utterly separated me from his people neither let the eunuch say behold i am a dry tree for thus saith the lord unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths and choose the things that please me and take hold of my covenant even unto them will i give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters i will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off also the sons of the stranger that join themselves to the lord to serve him and to love the name of the lord to be his servants every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it and taketh hold of my covenant even them will i bring to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people the lord god which gathereth the outcasts of israel saith yet will i gather others to him beside those that are gathered unto him all ye beasts of the field come to devour yea all ye beasts in the forest his watchmen are blind they are all ignorant they are all dumb dogs they cannot bark sleeping lying down loving to slumber yea they are greedy dogs which can never have enough and they are shepherds that cannot understand they all look to their own way every one for his gain from his quarter come ye say they i will fetch wine and we will fill ourselves with strong drink and to morrow shall be as this day and much more abundant the righteous perisheth and no man layeth it to heart and merciful men are taken away none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come he shall enter into peace they shall rest in their beds each one walking in his uprightness but draw near hither ye sons of the sorceress the seed of the adulterer and the whore against whom do ye sport yourselves against whom make ye a wide mouth and draw out the tongue are ye not children of transgression a seed of falsehood enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree slaying the children in the valleys under the clifts of the rocks among the smooth stones of the stream is thy portion they they are thy lot even to them hast thou poured a drink offering thou hast offered a meat offering should i receive comfort in these upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance for thou hast discovered thyself to another than me and art gone up thou hast enlarged thy bed and made thee a covenant with them thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it and thou wentest to the king with ointment and didst increase thy perfumes and didst send thy messengers far off and didst debase thyself even unto hell thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way yet saidst thou not there is no hope thou hast found the life of thine hand therefore thou wast not grieved and of whom hast thou been afraid or feared that thou hast lied and hast not remembered me nor laid it to thy heart have not i held my peace even of old and thou fearest me not i will declare thy righteousness and thy works for they shall not profit thee when thou criest let thy companies deliver thee but the wind shall carry them all away vanity shall take them but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land and shall inherit my holy mountain and shall say cast ye up cast ye up prepare the way take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people for thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity whose name is holy i dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones for i will not contend for ever neither will i be always wroth for the spirit should fail before me and the souls which i have made for the iniquity of his covetousness was i wroth and smote him i hid me and was wroth and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart i have seen his ways and will heal him i will lead him also and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners i create the fruit of the lips peace peace to him that is far off and to him that is near saith the lord and i will heal him but the wicked are like the troubled sea when it cannot rest whose waters cast up mire and dirt there is no peace
