god for his mercy as it is written for this cause i will confess to thee among the gentiles and sing unto thy name and again he saith rejoice ye gentiles with his people and again praise the lord all ye gentiles and laud him all ye people and again esaias saith there shall be a root of jesse and he that shall rise to reign over the gentiles in him shall the gentiles trust now the god of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing that ye may abound in hope through the power of the holy ghost and i myself also am persuaded of you my brethren that ye also are full of goodness filled with all knowledge able also to admonish one another nevertheless brethren i have written the more boldly unto you in some sort as putting you in mind because of the grace that is given to me of god that i should be the minister of jesus christ to the gentiles ministering the gospel of god that the offering up of the gentiles might be acceptable being sanctified by the holy ghost i have therefore whereof i may glory through jesus christ in those things which pertain to god for i will not dare to speak of any of those things which christ hath not wrought by me to make the gentiles obedient by word and deed through mighty signs and wonders by the power of the spirit of god so that from jerusalem and round about unto illyricum i have fully preached the gospel of christ yea so have i strived to preach the gospel not where christ was named lest i should build upon another mans foundation but as it is written to whom he was not spoken of they shall see and they that have not heard shall understand for which cause also i have been much hindered from coming to you but now having no more place in these parts and having a great desire these many years to come unto you whensoever i take my journey into spain i will come to you for i trust to see you in my journey and to be brought on my way thitherward by you if first i be somewhat filled with your company but now i go unto jerusalem to minister unto the saints for it hath pleased them of macedonia and achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at jerusalem it hath pleased them verily and their debtors they are for if the gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things when therefore i have performed this and have sealed to them this fruit i will come by you into spain and i am sure that when i come unto you i shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of christ now i beseech you brethren for the lord jesus christs sake and for the love of the spirit that ye strive together with me in your prayers to god for me that i may be delivered from them that do not believe in judaea and that my service which i have for jerusalem may be accepted of the saints that i may come unto you with joy by the will of god and may with you be refreshed now the god of peace be with you all amen i commend unto you phebe
