unto him it is said thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god and when the devil had ended all the temptation he departed from him for a season and jesus returned in the power of the spirit into galilee and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet esaias and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears and all bare him witness and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth and they said is not this josephs son and he said unto them ye will surely say unto me this proverb physician heal thyself whatsoever we have heard done in capernaum do also here in thy country and he said verily i say unto you no prophet is accepted in his own country but i tell you of a truth many widows were in israel in the days of elias when the heaven was shut up three years and six months when great famine was throughout all the land but unto none of them was elias sent save unto sarepta a city of sidon unto a woman that was a widow and many lepers were in israel in the time of eliseus the prophet and none of them was cleansed saving naaman the syrian and all they in the synagogue when they heard these things were filled with wrath and rose up and thrust him out of the city and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built that they might cast him down headlong but he passing through the midst of them went his way and came down to capernaum a city of galilee and taught them on the sabbath days and they were astonished at his doctrine for his word was with power and in the synagogue there was a man which had a spirit of an unclean devil and cried out with a loud voice saying let us alone what have we to do with thee thou jesus of nazareth art thou come to destroy us i know thee who thou art the holy one of god and jesus rebuked him saying hold thy peace and come out of him and when the devil had thrown him in the midst he came out of him and hurt him not and they were all amazed and spake among themselves saying what a word is this for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits and they come out and the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about and he arose out of the synagogue and entered into simons house and simons wifes mother was taken with a great fever and they besought him for her and he stood over her and rebuked the fever and it left her and immediately she arose and ministered unto them now when the sun was setting all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them and devils also came out of many crying out and saying thou art christ the son of god and he rebuking them suffered them not to speak for they knew that he was christ and when it was day he departed and went into a desert place and the people sought him and came unto him and stayed him that he should not depart from them and he said unto them i must preach the kingdom of god to other cities also for therefore am i sent and he preached in the synagogues of galilee and it came to pass that as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of god he stood by the lake of gennesaret and saw two ships standing by the lake but the fishermen were gone out of them and were washing their nets and he entered into one of the ships which was simons and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land and he sat down and taught the people out of the ship now when he had left speaking he said unto simon launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a draught and simon answering said unto him master we have toiled all the night and have taken nothing nevertheless at thy word i will let down the net and when they had this done they inclosed a great multitude of fishes and their net brake and they beckoned unto their partners which were in the other ship that they should come and help them and they came and filled both the ships so that they began to sink when simon peter saw it he fell down at jesus knees saying depart from me for i am a sinful man o lord for he was astonished and all that were with him at the draught of the fishes which they had taken and so was also james and john the sons of zebedee which were partners with simon and jesus said unto simon fear not from henceforth thou shalt catch men and when they had brought their ships to land they forsook all and followed him and it came to pass when he was in a certain city behold a man full of leprosy who seeing jesus fell on his face and besought him saying
