babylon unto jerusalem and besieged it and the lord gave jehoiakim king of judah into his hand with part of the vessels of the house of god which he carried into the land of shinar to the house of his god and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god and the king spake unto ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs that he should bring certain of the children of israel and of the kings seed and of the princes children in whom was no blemish but well favoured and skilful in all wisdom and cunning in knowledge and understanding science and such as had ability in them to stand in the kings palace and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the chaldeans and the king appointed them a daily provision of the kings meat and of the wine which he drank so nourishing them three years that at the end thereof they might stand before the king now among these were of the children of judah daniel hananiah mishael and azariah unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names for he gave unto daniel the name of belteshazzar and to hananiah of shadrach and to mishael of meshach and to azariah of abednego but daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the kings meat nor with the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself now god had brought daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs and the prince of the eunuchs said unto daniel i fear my lord the king who hath appointed your meat and your drink for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king then said daniel to melzar whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over daniel hananiah mishael and azariah prove thy servants
