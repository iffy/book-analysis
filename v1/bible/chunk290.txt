thousands and captains over the hundreds and the stewards over all the substance and possession of the king and of his sons with the officers and with the mighty men and with all the valiant men unto jerusalem then david the king stood up upon his feet and said hear me my brethren and my people as for me i had in mine heart to build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the lord and for the footstool of our god and had made ready for the building but god said unto me thou shalt not build an house for my name because thou hast been a man of war and hast shed blood howbeit the lord god of israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over israel for ever for he hath chosen judah to be the ruler and of the house of judah the house of my father and among the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over all israel and of all my sons for the lord hath given me many sons he hath chosen solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the lord over israel and he said unto me solomon thy son he shall build my house and my courts for i have chosen him to be my son and i will be his father moreover i will establish his kingdom for ever if he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments as at this day now therefore in the sight of all israel the congregation of the lord and in the audience of our god keep and seek for all the commandments of the lord your god that ye may possess this good land and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever and thou solomon my son know thou the god of thy father and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind for the lord searcheth all hearts and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts if thou seek him he will be found of thee but if thou forsake him he will
