a dry scall even a leprosy upon the head or beard and if the priest look on the plague of the scall and behold it be not in sight deeper than the skin and that there is no black hair in it then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of the scall seven days and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague and behold if the scall spread not and there be in it no yellow hair and the scall be not in sight deeper than the skin he shall be shaven but the scall shall he not shave and the priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall and behold if the scall be not spread in the skin nor be in sight deeper than the skin then the priest shall pronounce him clean and he shall wash his clothes and be clean but if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing then the priest shall look on him and behold if the scall be spread in the skin the priest shall not seek for yellow hair he is unclean but if the scall be in his sight at a stay and that there is black hair grown up therein the scall is healed he is clean and the priest shall pronounce him clean if a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots even white bright spots then the priest shall look and behold if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be darkish white it is a freckled spot that groweth in the skin he is clean and the man whose hair is fallen off his head he is bald yet is he clean and he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face he is forehead bald yet is he clean and if there be in the bald head or bald forehead a white reddish sore it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head or his bald forehead then the priest shall look upon it and behold if the rising of the sore be white reddish in his bald head or in his bald forehead as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh he is a leprous man he is unclean the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean his plague is in his head and the leper in whom the plague is his clothes shall be rent and his head bare and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip and shall cry unclean unclean all the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled he is unclean he shall dwell alone without the camp shall his habitation be the garment also that the plague of leprosy is in whether it be a woollen garment or a linen garment whether it be in the warp or woof of linen or of woollen whether in a skin or in any thing made of skin and if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment or in the skin either in the warp or in the woof or in any thing of skin it is a plague of leprosy and shall be shewed unto the priest and the priest shall look upon the plague and shut up it that hath the plague seven days and he shall look on the plague on the seventh day if the plague be spread in the garment either in the warp or in the woof or in a skin or in any work that is made of skin the plague is a fretting leprosy it is unclean he shall therefore burn that garment whether warp or woof in woollen or in linen or any thing of skin wherein the plague is for it is a fretting leprosy it shall be burnt in the fire and if the priest shall look and behold the plague be not spread in the garment either in the warp or in the woof or in any thing of skin then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is and he shall shut it up seven days more and the priest shall look on the plague after that it is washed and behold if the plague have not changed his colour and the plague be not spread it is unclean thou shalt burn it in the fire it is fret inward whether it be bare within or without and if the priest look and behold the plague be somewhat dark after the washing of it then he shall rend it out of the garment or out of the skin or out of the warp or out of the woof and if it appear still in the garment either in the warp or in the woof or in any thing of skin it is a spreading plague thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire and the garment either warp or woof or whatsoever thing of skin it be which thou shalt wash if the plague be departed from them then it shall be washed the second time and shall be clean this is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen either in the warp or woof or any thing of skins to pronounce it clean or to pronounce it unclean and the lord spake unto moses saying this shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing he shall be brought unto the priest and the priest shall go forth out of the camp and the priest shall look and behold if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive and clean and cedar wood and scarlet and hyssop and the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water as for the living bird he shall take it and the cedar wood and the scarlet and the hyssop and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water
