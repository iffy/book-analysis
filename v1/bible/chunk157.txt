said unto him thou knowest the thing that the lord said unto moses the man of god concerning me and thee in kadeshbarnea forty years old was i when moses the servant of the lord sent me from kadeshbarnea to espy out the land and i brought him word again as it was in mine heart nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt but i wholly followed the lord my god and moses sware on that day saying surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance and thy childrens for ever because thou hast wholly followed the lord my god and now behold the lord hath kept me alive as he said these forty and five years even since the lord spake this word unto moses while the children of israel wandered in the wilderness and now lo i am this day fourscore and five years old as yet i am as strong this day as i was in the day that moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war both to go out and to come in now therefore give me this mountain whereof the lord spake in that day for thou heardest in that day how the anakims were there and that the cities were great and fenced if so be the lord will be with me then i shall be able to drive them out as the lord said and joshua blessed him and gave unto caleb the son of jephunneh hebron for an inheritance hebron therefore became the inheritance of caleb the
