saying i am thy servant and thy son come up and save me out of the hand of the king of syria and out of the hand of the king of israel which rise up against me and ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the lord and in the treasures of the kings house and sent it for a present to the king of assyria and the king of assyria hearkened unto him for the king of assyria went up against damascus and took it and carried the people of it captive to kir and slew rezin and king ahaz went to damascus to meet tiglathpileser king of assyria and saw an altar that was at damascus and king ahaz sent to urijah the priest the fashion of the altar and the pattern of it according to all the workmanship thereof and urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king ahaz had sent from damascus so urijah the priest made it against king ahaz came from damascus and when the king was come from damascus the king saw the altar and the king approached to the altar and offered thereon and he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering and poured his drink offering and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings upon the altar and he brought also the brasen altar which was before the lord from the forefront of the house from between the altar and the house of the lord and put it on the north side of the altar and king ahaz commanded urijah the priest saying upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering and the evening meat offering and the kings burnt sacrifice and his meat offering with the burnt offering of all the people of the land and their meat offering and their drink offerings and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifice and the brasen altar shall be for me to enquire by thus did urijah the priest according to all that king ahaz commanded and king ahaz cut off the borders of the bases and removed the laver from off them and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that were under it and put it upon the pavement of stones and the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house and the kings entry without turned he from the house of the lord for the king of assyria now the rest of the acts of ahaz which he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah and ahaz slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david and hezekiah his son reigned in his stead in the twelfth year of ahaz king of judah began hoshea the son of elah to reign in samaria over israel nine years and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord but not as the kings of israel that were before him against him came up shalmaneser king of assyria and hoshea became his servant and gave him presents and the king of assyria found conspiracy in hoshea for he had sent messengers to so king of egypt and brought no present to the king of assyria as he had done year by year therefore the king of assyria shut him up and bound him in prison then the king of assyria came up throughout all the land and went up to samaria and besieged it three years in the ninth year of hoshea the king of assyria took samaria and carried israel away into assyria and placed them in halah and in habor by the river of gozan and in the cities of the medes for so it was that the children of israel had sinned against the lord their god which had
