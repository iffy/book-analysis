book of nehemiah the words of nehemiah the son of hachaliah and it came to pass in the month chisleu in the twentieth year as i was in shushan the palace that hanani one of my brethren came he and certain men of judah and i asked them concerning the jews that had escaped which were left of the captivity and concerning jerusalem and they said unto me the remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach the wall of jerusalem also is broken down and the gates thereof are burned with fire and it came to pass when i heard these words that i sat down and wept and mourned certain days and fasted and prayed before the god of heaven and said i beseech thee o lord god of heaven the great and terrible god that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments let thine ear now be attentive and thine eyes open that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant which i pray before thee now day and night for the children of israel thy servants and confess the sins of the children of israel which we have sinned against thee both i and my fathers house have sinned we have dealt very corruptly against thee and have not kept the commandments nor the statutes nor the judgments which thou commandedst thy servant moses remember i beseech thee the word that thou commandedst thy servant moses saying if ye transgress i will scatter you abroad among the nations but if ye turn unto me and keep my commandments and do them though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven yet will i gather them from thence and will bring them unto the place that i have chosen to set my name there now these are thy servants and thy people whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power and by thy strong hand o lord i beseech thee let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant and to the prayer of thy servants who desire to fear thy name and prosper i pray thee thy servant this day and grant him mercy in the sight of this man for i was the kings cupbearer and it came to pass in the month nisan in the twentieth year of artaxerxes the king that wine was before him and i took up the wine and gave it unto the king now i had not been beforetime sad in his presence wherefore the king said unto me why is thy countenance sad seeing thou art not sick this is nothing else but sorrow of heart then i was very sore afraid and said unto the king let the king live for ever why should not my countenance be sad when the city the place of my fathers sepulchres lieth waste and the gates thereof are consumed with fire then the king said unto me for what dost thou make request so i prayed to the god of heaven and i said unto the king if it please the king and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight that thou wouldest send me unto judah unto the city of my fathers sepulchres that i may build it and the king said unto me the queen also sitting by him for how long shall thy journey be and when wilt thou return so it pleased the king to send me and i set him a time moreover i said unto the king if it please the king let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river that they may convey me over till i come into judah and a letter unto asaph the keeper of the kings forest that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house and for the wall of the city and for the house that i shall enter into and the king granted me according to the good hand of my god upon me then i came to the governors beyond the river and gave them the kings letters now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me when sanballat the horonite and tobiah the servant the ammonite heard of it it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of israel so i came to jerusalem and was there three days and i arose in the night i and some few men with me neither told i any man what my god had put in my heart to do at jerusalem neither was there any beast with me save the beast that i rode upon and i went out by night by the gate of the valley even before the dragon well and to the dung port and viewed the walls of jerusalem which were broken down and the gates thereof were consumed with fire then i went on to the gate of the fountain and to the kings pool but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass then went i up in the night by the brook and viewed the wall and turned back and entered by the gate of the valley and so returned and the rulers knew not whither i went or what i did neither had i as yet told it to the jews nor to the priests nor to the
