way toward the north so i lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry he said furthermore unto me son of man seest thou what they do even the great abominations that the house of israel committeth here that i should go far off from my sanctuary but turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater abominations and he brought me to the door of the court and when i looked behold a hole in the wall then said he unto me son of man dig now in the wall and when i had digged in the wall behold a door and he said unto me go in and behold the wicked abominations that they do here so i went in and saw and behold every form of creeping things and abominable beasts and all the idols of the house of israel pourtrayed upon the wall round about and there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of israel and in the midst of them stood jaazaniah the son of shaphan with every man his censer in his hand and a thick cloud of incense went up then said he unto me son of man hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of israel do in the dark every man in the chambers of his imagery for they say the lord seeth us not the lord hath forsaken the earth he said also unto me turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater abominations that they do then he brought me to the door of the gate of the lords house which was toward the north and behold there sat women weeping for tammuz then said he unto me hast thou seen this o son of man turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater abominations than these and he brought me into the inner court of the lords house and behold at the door of the temple of the lord between the porch and the altar were about five and twenty men with their backs toward the temple of the lord and their faces toward the east and they worshipped the sun toward the east then he said unto me hast thou seen this o son of man is it a light thing to the house of judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here for they have filled the land with violence and have returned to provoke me to anger and lo they put the branch to their nose therefore will i also deal in fury mine eye shall not spare neither will i have pity and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice yet will i not hear them he cried also in mine ears with a loud voice saying cause them that have charge over the city to draw near even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which lieth toward the north and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand and one man among them was clothed with linen with a writers inkhorn by his side and they went in and stood beside the brasen altar and the glory of the god of israel was gone up from the cherub whereupon he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed with linen which had the writers inkhorn by his side and the lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof and to the others he said in mine hearing go ye after him through the city and smite let not your eye spare neither have ye pity slay utterly old and young both maids and little children and women but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at my sanctuary then they began at the ancient men which were before the house and he said unto them defile the house and fill the courts with the slain go

even under the cherub and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims and scatter them over the city and he went in in my sight now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house when the man went in and the cloud filled the inner court then the glory of the lord went up from the cherub and stood over the threshold of the house and the house was filled with the cloud and the
