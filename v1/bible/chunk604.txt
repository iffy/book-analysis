that hour that speak ye for it is not ye that speak but the holy ghost now the brother shall betray the brother to death and the father the son and children shall rise up against their parents and shall cause them to be put to death and ye shall be hated of all men for my names sake but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved but when ye shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by daniel the prophet standing where it ought not let him that readeth understand then let them that be in judaea flee to the mountains and let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house neither enter therein to take any thing out of his house and let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment but woe to them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days and pray ye that your flight be not in the winter for in those days shall be affliction such as was not from the beginning of the creation which god created unto this time neither shall be and except that the lord had shortened those days no flesh should be saved but for the elects sake whom he hath chosen he hath shortened the days and then if any man shall say to you lo here is christ or lo he is there believe him not for false christs and false prophets shall rise and shall shew signs and wonders to seduce if it were possible even the elect but take ye heed behold i have foretold you all things but in those days after that tribulation the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars of heaven shall fall and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory and then shall he send his angels and shall gather together his elect from the four winds from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven now learn a parable of the fig tree when her branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves ye know that summer is near so ye in like manner when ye shall see these things come to pass know that it is nigh even at the doors verily i say unto you that this generation shall not pass till all these things be done heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away but of that day and that hour knoweth no man no not the angels which are in heaven neither the son but the father take ye heed watch and pray for ye know not when the time is for the son of man is as a man taking a far journey who left his house and gave authority to his servants and to every man his work and commanded the porter to watch watch ye therefore for ye know not when the master of the house cometh at even or at midnight or at the cockcrowing or in the morning lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping and what i say unto you i say unto all watch after two days was the feast of the passover and of unleavened bread and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft and put him to death but they said not on the feast day lest there be an uproar of the people and being in bethany in the house of simon the leper as he sat at meat there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious and she brake the box and poured it on his head and there were some that had indignation within themselves and said why was this waste of the ointment made for it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence and have been given to the poor and they murmured against her and jesus said let her alone why trouble ye her she hath wrought a good work on me for ye have the poor with you always and whensoever ye will ye may do them good but me ye have not always she hath done what she could she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying verily i say unto you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her and judas iscariot one of the twelve went unto the chief priests to betray him unto them and when they heard it they were glad and promised to give him money and he sought how he might conveniently betray him and the first day of unleavened bread when they killed the passover his disciples said unto him where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover and he sendeth forth two of his disciples and saith unto them go ye into the city and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water follow him and wheresoever he shall go in say ye to the goodman of the house the master saith where is the guestchamber where i shall eat the passover with my disciples and he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared there make ready for us and his disciples went forth and came into the city and found as he had said unto them and they made ready the passover and in the evening he cometh with the twelve and as they sat and did eat jesus said verily i say unto you one of you which eateth with me shall betray me and they began to be sorrowful and to say unto him one by one is it i and another said is it i and he answered and said unto them it is one of the twelve that dippeth with me in the dish the son of man indeed goeth as it is written of him but woe to that man by whom the son of man is betrayed good were it for that
