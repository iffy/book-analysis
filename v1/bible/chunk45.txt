selfsame day that the lord did bring the children of israel out of the land of egypt by their armies and the lord spake unto moses saying sanctify unto me all the firstborn whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of israel both of man and of beast it is mine and moses said unto the people remember this day in which ye came out from egypt out of the house of bondage for by strength of hand the lord brought you out from this place there shall no leavened bread be eaten this day came ye out in the month abib and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land of the canaanites and the hittites and the amorites and the hivites and the jebusites which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee a land flowing with milk and honey that thou shalt keep this service in this month seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the lord unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters and thou shalt shew thy son in that day saying this is done because of that which the lord did unto me when i came forth out of egypt and it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand and for a memorial between thine eyes that the lords law may be in thy mouth for with a strong hand hath the lord brought thee out of egypt thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land of the canaanites as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers and shall give it thee that thou shalt set apart unto the lord all that openeth the matrix and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast the males shall be the lords and every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb and if thou wilt not redeem it then thou shalt break his neck and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem and it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come saying what is this that thou shalt say unto him by strength of hand the lord brought us out from egypt from the house of bondage and it came to pass when pharaoh would hardly let us go that the lord slew all the firstborn in the land of egypt both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast therefore i sacrifice to the lord all that openeth the matrix being males but all the firstborn of my children i redeem and it shall be for a token upon thine hand and for frontlets between thine eyes for by strength of hand the lord brought us forth out of egypt and it came to pass when pharaoh had let the people go that god led them not through the way of the land of the philistines although that was near for god said lest peradventure the people repent when they see war and they return to egypt but god led the people about through the way of the wilderness of the red sea and the children of israel went up harnessed out of the land of egypt and moses took the bones of joseph with him for he had straitly sworn the children of israel saying god will surely visit you and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you and they took their journey from succoth and encamped in etham in the edge of the wilderness and the lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud to lead them the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and night he took not away the pillar of the cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night from before the people and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel that they turn and encamp before pihahiroth between migdol and the sea over against baalzephon before it shall ye encamp by the sea for pharaoh will say of the children of israel they are entangled in the land the wilderness hath shut them in and i will harden pharaohs heart that he shall follow after them and i will be honoured upon pharaoh and upon all his host that the egyptians may know that i am the lord and they did so and it was told the king of egypt that the people fled and the heart of pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people and they said why have we done this that we have let israel go from serving us and he made ready his chariot and took his people with him and he took six hundred chosen chariots and all the chariots of egypt and captains over every one of them and the lord hardened the heart of pharaoh king of egypt and he pursued after the children of israel and the children of israel went out with an high hand but the egyptians pursued after them all the horses and chariots of pharaoh and his horsemen and his army and overtook them encamping by the sea beside pihahiroth before baalzephon and when pharaoh drew nigh the children of israel lifted up their eyes and behold the egyptians marched after them and they were sore afraid and the children of israel cried out unto the lord and they said unto moses because there were no graves in egypt hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us to carry us forth out of egypt is not this the word that we did tell thee in egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the egyptians for it had been better for us to serve the egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness and moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he will shew to you to day for the egyptians whom ye have
