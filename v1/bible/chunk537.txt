ask a petition of any god or man within thirty days save of thee o king shall be cast into the den of lions the king answered and said the thing is true according to the law of the medes and persians which altereth not then answered they and said before the king that daniel which is of the children of the captivity of judah regardeth not thee o king nor the decree that thou hast signed but maketh his petition three times a day then the king when he heard these words was sore displeased with himself and set his heart on daniel to deliver him and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him then these men assembled unto the king and said unto the king know o king that the law of the medes and persians is that no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed then the king commanded and they brought daniel and cast him into the den of lions now the king spake and said unto daniel thy god whom thou servest continually he will deliver thee and a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords that the purpose might not be changed concerning daniel then the king went to his palace and passed the night fasting neither were instruments of musick brought before him and his sleep went from him then the king arose very early in the morning and went in haste unto the den of lions and when he came to the den he cried with a lamentable voice unto daniel and the king spake and said to daniel o daniel servant of the living god is thy god whom thou servest continually able to deliver thee from the lions then said daniel unto the king o king live for ever my god hath sent his angel and hath shut the lions mouths that they have not hurt me forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me and also before thee o king have i done no hurt then was the king exceedingly glad for him and commanded that they should take daniel up out of the den so daniel was taken up out of the den and no manner of hurt was found upon him because he believed in his god and the king commanded and they brought those men which had accused daniel and they cast them into the den of lions them their children and their wives and the lions had the mastery of them and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den then king darius wrote unto all people nations and languages that dwell in all the earth peace be multiplied unto you i make a decree that in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the god of daniel for he is the living god and stedfast for ever and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed and his dominion shall be even unto the end he delivereth and rescueth and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth who hath delivered daniel from the power of the lions so this daniel prospered in the reign of darius and in the reign of cyrus the persian in the first year of belshazzar king of babylon daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters daniel spake and said i saw in my vision by night and behold the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea and four great beasts came up from the sea diverse one from another the first was like a lion and had eagles wings i beheld till the wings thereof were plucked and it was lifted up from the earth and made stand upon the feet as a man and a mans heart was given to it and behold another beast a second like to a bear and it raised up itself on one side and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it and they said thus unto it arise devour much flesh after this i beheld and lo another like a leopard which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl the beast had also four heads and dominion was given to it after this i saw in the night visions and behold a fourth beast dreadful and terrible and strong exceedingly and it had great iron teeth it devoured and brake in pieces and stamped the residue with the feet of it and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it and it had ten horns i considered the horns and behold there came up among them another little horn before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots and behold in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man and a mouth speaking great things i beheld till the thrones were cast down and the ancient of days did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like the pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame and his wheels as burning fire a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him thousand thousands ministered unto him and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him the judgment was set and the books were opened i beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake i beheld even till the beast was slain and his body destroyed and given to the burning flame as concerning the rest of the beasts they had their dominion taken away yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time i saw in the night visions and behold one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven and came to the ancient of days and they brought him near before him and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all people nations and languages should serve him his dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that
