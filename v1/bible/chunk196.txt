israel fill thine horn with oil and go i will send thee to jesse the bethlehemite for i have provided me a king among his sons and samuel said how can i go if saul hear it he will kill me and the lord said take an heifer with thee and say i am come to sacrifice to the lord and call jesse to the sacrifice and i will shew thee what thou shalt do and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom i name unto thee and samuel did that which the lord spake and came to bethlehem and the elders of the town trembled at his coming and said comest thou peaceably and he said peaceably i am come to sacrifice unto the lord sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice and he sanctified jesse and his sons and called them to the sacrifice and it came to pass when they were come that he looked on eliab and said surely the lords anointed is before him but the lord said unto samuel look not on his countenance or on the height of his stature because i have refused him for the lord seeth not as man seeth for man looketh on the outward appearance but the lord looketh on the heart then jesse called abinadab and made him pass before samuel and he said neither hath the lord chosen this then jesse made shammah to pass by and he said neither hath the lord chosen this again jesse made seven of his sons to pass before samuel and samuel said unto jesse the lord hath not chosen these and samuel said unto jesse are here all thy children and he said there remaineth yet the youngest and behold he keepeth the sheep and samuel said unto jesse send and fetch him for we will not sit down till he come hither and he sent and brought him in now he was ruddy and withal of a beautiful countenance and goodly to look to and the lord said arise anoint him for this is he then samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brethren and the spirit of the lord came upon david from that day forward so samuel rose up and went to ramah but the spirit of the lord departed from saul and an evil spirit from the lord troubled him and sauls servants said unto him behold now an evil spirit from god troubleth thee let our lord now command thy servants which are before thee to seek out a man who is a cunning player on an harp and it shall come to pass when the evil spirit from god is upon thee that he shall play with his hand and thou shalt be well and saul said unto his servants provide me now a man that can play well and bring him to me then answered one of the servants and said behold i have seen a son of jesse the bethlehemite that is cunning in playing and a mighty valiant man and a man of war and prudent in matters and a comely person and the lord is with him wherefore saul sent messengers unto jesse and said send me david thy son which is with the sheep and jesse took an ass laden with bread and a bottle of wine and a kid and sent them by david his son unto saul and david came to saul and stood before him and he loved him greatly and he became his armourbearer and saul sent to jesse saying let david i pray thee stand before me for he hath found favour in my sight and it came to pass when the evil spirit from god was upon saul that david took an harp and played with his hand so saul was refreshed and was well and the evil spirit departed from him now the philistines gathered together their armies to battle and were gathered together at shochoh which belongeth to judah and pitched between shochoh and azekah in ephesdammim and saul and the men of israel were gathered together and pitched by the valley of elah and set the battle in array against the philistines and the philistines stood on a mountain on the one side and israel stood on a mountain on the other side and there was a valley between them and there went out a champion out of the camp of the philistines named goliath of gath whose height was six cubits and a span and he had an helmet of brass upon his head and he was armed with a coat of mail and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass and he had greaves of brass upon his legs and a target of brass between his shoulders and the staff of his spear was like a weavers beam and his spears head weighed six hundred shekels of iron and one bearing a shield went before him and he stood and cried unto the armies of israel and said unto them why are ye come out to set your battle in array am not i a philistine and ye servants to saul choose you a man for you and let him come down to me if he be able to fight with me and to kill me then will we be your servants but if i prevail against him and kill him then shall ye be our servants and serve us and the philistine said i defy the armies of israel this day give me a man that we may fight together when saul and all israel heard those words of the philistine they were dismayed and greatly afraid now david was the son of that ephrathite of bethlehemjudah whose name was jesse and he had eight sons and the man went among men for an old man in the days of saul and the three eldest sons of jesse went and followed saul to the battle and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were eliab the firstborn and next unto him abinadab and the third shammah and david was the youngest and the three eldest followed saul but david went and returned from saul to feed his fathers sheep at bethlehem and the philistine drew near morning
