of the gentiles is on his way he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate and thy cities shall be laid waste without an inhabitant for this gird you with sackcloth lament and howl for the fierce anger of the lord is not turned back from us and it shall come to pass at that day saith the lord that the heart of the king shall perish and the heart of the princes and the priests shall be astonished and the prophets shall wonder then said i ah lord god surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and jerusalem saying ye shall have peace whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul at that time shall it be said to this people and to jerusalem a dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people not to fan nor to cleanse even a full wind from those places shall come unto me now also will i give sentence against them behold he shall come up as clouds and his chariots shall be as a whirlwind his horses are swifter than eagles woe unto us for we are spoiled o jerusalem wash thine heart from wickedness that thou mayest be saved how long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee for a voice declareth from dan and publisheth affliction from mount ephraim make ye mention to the nations behold publish against jerusalem that watchers come from a far country and give out their voice against the cities of judah as keepers of a field are they against her round about because she hath been rebellious against me saith the lord thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee this is thy wickedness because it is bitter because it reacheth unto thine heart my bowels my bowels i am pained at my very heart my heart maketh a noise in me i cannot hold my peace because thou hast heard o my soul the sound of the trumpet the alarm of war destruction upon destruction is cried for the whole land is spoiled suddenly are my tents spoiled and my curtains in a moment how long shall i see the standard and hear the sound of the trumpet for my people is foolish they have not known me they are sottish children and they have none understanding they are wise to do evil but to do good they have no knowledge i beheld the earth and lo it was without form and void and the heavens and they had no light i beheld the mountains and lo they trembled and all the hills moved lightly i beheld and lo there was no man and all the birds of the heavens were fled i beheld and lo the fruitful place was a wilderness and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the lord and by his fierce anger for thus hath the lord said the whole land shall be desolate yet will i not make a full end for this shall the earth mourn and the heavens above be black because i have spoken it i have purposed it and will not repent neither will i turn back from it the whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen they shall go into thickets and climb up upon the rocks every city shall be forsaken and not a man dwell therein and when thou art spoiled what wilt thou do though thou clothest thyself with crimson though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold though thou rentest thy face with painting in vain shalt thou make thyself fair thy lovers will despise thee they will seek thy life for i have heard a voice as of a woman in travail and the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child the voice of the daughter of zion that bewaileth herself that spreadeth her hands saying woe is me now for my soul is wearied because of murderers run ye to and fro through the streets of jerusalem and see now and know and seek in the broad places thereof if ye can find a man if there be any that executeth judgment that seeketh the truth and i will pardon it and though they say the lord liveth surely they swear falsely o lord are not thine eyes upon the truth thou hast stricken them but they have not grieved thou hast consumed them but they have refused to receive correction they have made their faces harder than a rock they have refused to return therefore i said surely these are poor they are foolish for they know not the way of the lord nor the judgment of their god i will get me unto the great men and will speak unto them for they have known the way of the lord and the judgment of their god but these have altogether broken the yoke and burst the bonds wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them and a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them a leopard shall watch over their cities every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces because their transgressions are many and their backslidings are increased how shall i pardon thee for this thy children have forsaken me and sworn by them that are no gods when i had fed them to the full they then committed adultery and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots houses they were as fed horses in the morning every one neighed after his neighbours wife shall i not visit for these things saith the lord and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this go ye up upon her walls and destroy but make not a full end take away her battlements for they are not the lords for the house of israel and the house of judah have dealt very treacherously against me saith the lord they have belied the lord and said it is not he neither shall evil come upon us neither shall we see sword nor famine and the prophets shall become wind and the word is not in them thus shall it be done unto them wherefore thus saith the lord god of hosts because ye speak this word behold i will make
