for the lord any longer then elisha said hear ye the word of the lord thus saith the lord to morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel in the gate of samaria then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of god and said behold if the lord would make windows in heaven might this thing be and he said behold thou shalt see it with thine eyes but shalt not eat thereof and there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate and they said one to another why sit we here until we die if we say we will enter into the city then the famine is in the city and we shall die there and if we sit still here we die also now therefore come and let us fall unto the host of the syrians if they save us alive we shall live and if they kill us we shall but die and they rose up in the twilight to go unto the camp of the syrians and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of syria behold there was no man there for the lord had made the host of the syrians to hear a noise of chariots and a noise of horses even the noise of a great host and they said one to another lo the king of israel hath hired against us the kings of the hittites and the kings of the egyptians to come upon us wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight and left their tents and their horses and their asses even the camp as it was and fled for their life and when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp they went into one tent and did eat and drink and carried thence silver and gold and raiment and went and hid it and came again and entered into another tent and carried thence also and went and hid it then they said one to another we do not well this day is a day of good tidings and we hold our peace if we tarry till the morning light some mischief will come upon us now therefore come that we may go and tell the kings household so they came and called unto the porter of the city and they told them saying we came to the camp of the syrians and behold there was no man there neither voice of man but horses tied and asses tied and the tents as they were and he called the porters and they told it to the kings house within and the king arose in the night and said unto his servants i will now shew you what the syrians have done to us they know that we be hungry therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field saying when they come out of the city we shall catch them alive and get into the city and one of his servants answered and said let some take i pray thee five of the horses that remain which are left in the city behold they are as all the multitude of israel that are left in it behold i say they are even as all the multitude of the israelites that are consumed and let us send and see they took therefore two chariot horses and the king sent after the host of the syrians saying go and see and they went after them unto jordan and lo all the way was full of garments and vessels which the syrians had cast away in their haste and the messengers returned and told the king and the people went out and spoiled the tents of the syrians so a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel according to the word of the lord and the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate and the people trode upon him in the gate and he died as the man of god had said who spake when the king came down to him and it came to pass as the man of god had spoken to the king saying two measures of barley for a shekel and a measure of fine flour for a shekel shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of samaria and that lord answered the man of god and said now behold if the lord should make windows in heaven might such a thing be and he said behold thou shalt see it with thine eyes but shalt not eat thereof and so it fell out unto him for the people trode upon him in the gate and he died then spake elisha unto the woman whose son he had restored to life saying arise and go thou and thine household and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn for the lord hath called for a famine and it shall also come upon the land seven years and the woman arose and did after the saying of the man of god and she went with her household and sojourned in the land of the philistines seven years and it came to pass at the seven years end that the woman returned out of the land of the philistines and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land and the king talked with gehazi the servant of the man of god saying tell me i pray thee all the great things that elisha hath done and it came to pass as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life that behold the woman whose son he had restored to life cried to the king for her house and for her land and gehazi said my lord o king this is the woman and this is her son whom elisha restored to life and when the king asked the woman she told him so the king appointed unto her a certain officer saying restore all that was hers and all the fruits of the field since the day that she
