stood before pharaoh king of egypt and joseph went out from the presence of pharaoh and went throughout all the land of egypt and in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls and he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of egypt and laid up the food in the cities the food of the field which was round about every city laid he up in the same and joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea very much until he left numbering for it was without number and unto joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came which asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on bare unto him and joseph called the name of the firstborn manasseh for god said he hath made me forget all my toil and all my fathers house and the name of the second called he ephraim for god hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction and the seven years of plenteousness that was in the land of egypt were ended and the seven years of dearth began to come according as joseph had said and the dearth was in all lands but in all the land of egypt there was bread and when all the land of egypt was famished the people cried to pharaoh for bread and pharaoh said unto all the egyptians go unto joseph what he saith to you do and the famine was over all the face of the earth and joseph opened all the storehouses and sold unto the egyptians and the famine waxed sore in the land of egypt and all countries came into egypt to joseph for to buy corn because that the famine was so sore in all lands now when jacob saw that there was corn in egypt jacob said unto his sons why do ye look one upon another and he said behold i have heard that there is corn in egypt get you down thither and buy for us from thence that we may live and not die and josephs ten brethren went down to buy corn in egypt but benjamin josephs brother jacob sent not with his brethren for he said lest peradventure mischief befall him and the sons of israel came to buy corn among those that came for the famine was in the land of canaan and joseph was the governor over the land and he it was that sold to all the people of the land and josephs brethren came and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth and joseph saw his brethren and he knew them but made himself strange unto them and spake roughly unto them and he said unto them whence come ye and they said from the land of canaan to buy food and joseph knew his brethren but they knew not him and joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them and said unto them ye are spies to see the nakedness of the land ye are come and they said unto him nay my lord but to buy food are thy servants come we are all one mans sons we are true men thy servants are no spies and he said unto them nay but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come and they said thy servants are twelve brethren the sons of one man in the land of canaan and behold the youngest is this day with our father and one is not and joseph said unto them that is it that i spake unto you saying ye are spies hereby ye shall be proved by the life of pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence except your youngest brother come hither send one of you and let him fetch your brother and ye shall be kept in prison that your words may be proved whether there be any truth in you or else by the life of pharaoh surely ye are spies and he put them all together into ward three days and joseph said unto them the third day this do and live for i fear god if ye be true men let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison go ye carry corn for the famine of your houses but bring your youngest brother unto me so shall your words be verified and ye shall not die and they did so and they said one to another we are verily guilty concerning our brother in that we saw the anguish of his soul when he besought us and we would not hear therefore is this distress come upon us and reuben answered them saying spake i not unto you saying do not sin against the child and ye would not hear therefore behold also his blood is required and they knew not that joseph understood them for he spake unto them by an interpreter and he turned himself about from them and wept and returned to them again and communed with them and took from them simeon and bound him before their eyes then joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn and to restore every mans money into his sack and to give them provision for the way and thus did he unto them and they laded their asses with the corn and departed thence and as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn he espied his money for behold it was in his sacks mouth and he said unto his brethren my money is restored and lo it is even in my sack and their heart failed them and they were afraid saying one to another what is this that god hath done unto us and they came unto jacob their father unto the land of canaan and told him all that befell unto them saying the man who is the lord of the land spake roughly to us and took us for spies of the country and we said unto him we are true men we are no spies we be twelve brethren sons of our father one is not and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of canaan and the man the lord of the country said unto
