i smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labours of your hands yet ye turned not to me saith the lord consider now from this day and upward from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month even from the day that the foundation of the lords temple was laid consider it is the seed yet in the barn yea as yet the vine and the fig tree and the pomegranate and the olive tree hath not brought forth from this day will i bless you and again the word of the lord came unto haggai in the four and twentieth day of the month saying speak to zerubbabel governor of judah saying i will shake the heavens and the earth and i will overthrow the throne of kingdoms and i will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen and i will overthrow the chariots and those that ride in them and the horses and their riders shall come down every one by the sword of his brother in that day saith the lord of hosts will i take thee o zerubbabel my servant the son of shealtiel saith the lord and will make thee as a signet for i have chosen thee saith the lord of hosts zechariah in the eighth month in the second year of darius came the word of the lord unto zechariah the son of berechiah the son of iddo the prophet saying the lord hath been sore displeased with your fathers therefore say thou unto them thus saith the lord of hosts turn ye unto me saith the lord of hosts and i will turn unto you saith the lord of hosts be ye not as your fathers unto whom the former prophets have cried saying thus saith the lord of hosts turn ye now from your evil ways and from your evil doings but they did not hear nor hearken unto me saith the lord your fathers where are they and the prophets do they live for ever but my words and my statutes which i commanded my servants the prophets did they not take hold of your fathers and they returned and said like as the lord of hosts thought to do unto us according to our ways and according to our doings so hath he dealt with us upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month which is the month sebat in the second year of darius came the word of the lord unto zechariah the son of berechiah the son of iddo the prophet saying i saw by night and behold a man riding upon a red horse and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom and behind him were there red horses speckled and white then said i o my lord what are these and the angel that talked with me said unto me i will shew thee what these be and the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said these are they whom the lord hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth and they answered the angel of the lord that stood among the myrtle trees and said we have walked to and fro through the earth and behold all the earth sitteth still and is at rest then the angel of the lord answered and said o lord of hosts how long wilt thou not have mercy on jerusalem and on the cities of judah against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years and the lord answered the angel that talked with me with good words and comfortable words so the angel that communed with me said unto me cry thou saying thus saith the lord of hosts i am jealous for jerusalem and for zion with a great jealousy and i am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease for i was but a little displeased and they helped forward the affliction therefore thus saith the lord i am returned to jerusalem with mercies my house shall be built in it saith the lord of hosts and a line shall be stretched forth upon jerusalem cry yet saying
