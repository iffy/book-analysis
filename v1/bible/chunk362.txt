hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy thou hast set my feet in a large room have mercy upon me o lord for i am in trouble mine eye is consumed with grief yea my soul and my belly for my life is spent with grief and my years with sighing my strength faileth because of mine iniquity and my bones are consumed i was a reproach among all mine enemies but especially among my neighbours and a fear to mine acquaintance they that did see me without fled from me i am forgotten as a dead man out of mind i am like a broken vessel for i have heard the slander of many fear was on every side while they took counsel together against me they devised to take away my life but i trusted in thee o lord i said thou art my god my times are in thy hand deliver me from the hand of mine enemies and from them that persecute me make thy face to shine upon thy servant save me for thy mercies sake let me not be ashamed o lord for i have called upon thee let the wicked be ashamed and let them be silent in the grave let the lying lips be put to silence which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous oh how great is thy goodness which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues blessed be the lord for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city for i said in my haste i am cut off from before thine eyes nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when i cried unto thee o love the lord all ye his saints for the lord preserveth the faithful and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer be of good courage and he shall strengthen your heart all ye that hope in the lord blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven whose sin is covered blessed is the man unto whom the lord imputeth not iniquity and in whose spirit there is no guile

thee and mine iniquity have i not hid i said i will confess my transgressions unto the lord and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin selah for this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him thou art my hiding place thou shalt preserve me from trouble thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance selah i will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go i will guide thee with mine eye be ye not as the horse or as the mule which have no understanding whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle lest they come near unto thee many sorrows shall be to the wicked but he that trusteth in the lord mercy shall compass him about be glad in the lord and rejoice ye righteous and shout for joy all ye that are upright in heart rejoice in the lord o ye righteous for praise is comely for the upright praise the lord with harp sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings sing unto him a new song play skilfully with a loud noise for the word of the lord is right and all his works are done in truth he loveth righteousness and judgment the earth is full of the goodness of the lord by the word of the lord were the heavens made and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth he gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap he layeth up the depth in storehouses let all the earth fear the lord let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him for he spake and it was done he commanded and it stood fast the lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought he maketh the devices of the people of none effect the counsel of the lord standeth for ever the thoughts of his heart to all generations blessed is the nation whose god is the lord and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance the lord looketh from heaven he beholdeth all the sons of men from the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth he fashioneth their hearts alike he considereth all their works there is no king saved by the multitude of an host a mighty man is not delivered by much strength an horse is a vain thing for safety neither shall he deliver any by his great strength behold the eye of the lord is upon them that fear him upon them that hope in
