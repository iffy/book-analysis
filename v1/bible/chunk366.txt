cause against an ungodly nation o deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man for thou art the god of my strength why dost thou cast me off why go i mourning because of the oppression of the enemy o

praise thee o god my god why art thou cast down o my soul and why art thou disquieted within me hope in god for i shall yet praise him who is the health of my countenance and my god we have heard with our ears o god our fathers have told us what work thou didst in their days in the times of old how thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand and plantedst them how thou didst afflict the people and cast them out for they got not the land in possession by their own sword neither did their own arm save them but thy right hand and thine arm and the light of thy countenance because thou hadst a favour unto them thou art my king o god command deliverances for jacob through thee will we push down our enemies through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us for i will not trust in my bow neither shall my sword save me but thou hast saved us from our enemies and hast put them to shame that hated us in god we boast all the day long and praise thy name for ever selah but thou hast cast off and put us to shame and goest not forth with our armies thou makest us to turn back from the enemy and they which hate us spoil for themselves thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat and hast scattered us among the heathen thou sellest thy people for nought and dost not increase thy wealth by their price thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us thou makest us a byword among the heathen a shaking of the head among the people my confusion is continually before me and the shame of my face hath covered me for the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth by reason of the enemy and avenger all this is come upon us yet have we not forgotten thee neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant our heart is not turned back neither have our steps declined from thy way though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons and covered us with the shadow of death if we have forgotten the name of our god or stretched out our hands to a strange god shall not god search this out for he knoweth the secrets of the heart yea for thy sake are we killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter awake why sleepest thou o lord arise cast us not off for ever wherefore hidest thou thy face and forgettest our affliction and our oppression for our soul is bowed down to the dust our belly cleaveth unto the earth arise for our help and redeem us for thy mercies sake my heart is inditing a good matter i speak of the things which i have made touching the king my tongue is the pen of a ready writer thou art fairer than the children of men grace is poured into thy lips therefore god hath blessed thee for ever gird thy sword upon thy thigh o most mighty with thy glory and thy majesty and in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the kings enemies whereby the people fall under thee thy throne o god is for ever and ever the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre thou lovest righteousness and hatest wickedness therefore god thy god hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows all thy garments smell of myrrh and aloes and cassia out of the ivory palaces whereby they have made thee glad kings daughters were among thy honourable women upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of ophir hearken o daughter and consider and incline thine ear forget also thine own people and thy fathers house so shall the king greatly desire thy beauty for he is thy lord and worship thou him and the daughter of tyre shall be there with a gift even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour the kings daughter is all glorious within her
