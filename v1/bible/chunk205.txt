his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster but abner and the people lay round about him then said abishai to david god hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day now therefore let me smite him i pray thee with the spear even to the earth at once and i will not smite him the second time and david said to abishai destroy him not for who can stretch forth his hand against the lords anointed and be guiltless david said furthermore as the lord liveth the lord shall smite him or his day shall come to die or he shall descend into battle and perish the lord forbid that i should stretch forth mine hand against the lords anointed but i pray thee take thou now the spear that is at his bolster and the cruse of water and let us go so david took the spear and the cruse of water from sauls bolster and they gat them away and no man saw it nor knew it neither awaked for they were all asleep because a deep sleep from the lord was fallen upon them then david went over to the other side and stood on the top of an hill afar off a great space being between them and david cried to the people and to abner the son of ner saying answerest thou not abner then abner answered and said who art thou that criest to the king and david said to abner art not thou a valiant man and who is like to thee in israel wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord this thing is not good that thou hast done as the lord liveth ye are worthy to die because ye have not kept your master the lords anointed and now see where the kings spear is and the cruse of water that was at his bolster and saul knew davids voice and said is this thy voice my son david and david said it is my voice my lord o king and he said wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant for what have i done or what evil is in mine hand now therefore i pray thee let my lord the king hear the words of his servant if the lord have stirred thee up against me let him accept an offering but if they be the children of men cursed be they before the lord for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the lord saying go serve other gods now therefore let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the lord for the king of israel is come out to seek a flea as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains then said saul i have sinned return my son david for i will no more do thee harm because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day behold i have played the fool and have erred exceedingly and david answered and said behold the kings spear and let one of the young men come over and fetch it the lord render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness for the lord delivered thee into my hand to day but i would not stretch forth mine hand against the lords anointed and behold as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the lord and let him deliver me out of all tribulation then saul said to david blessed be thou my son david thou shalt both do great things and also shalt still prevail so david went on his way and saul returned to his place and david said in his heart i shall now perish one day by the hand of saul there is nothing better for me than that i should speedily escape into the land of the philistines and saul shall despair of me to seek me any more in any coast of israel so shall i escape out of his hand and david arose and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto achish the son of maoch king of gath and david dwelt with achish at gath he and his men every man with his household even david with his two wives ahinoam the jezreelitess and abigail the carmelitess nabals wife and it was told saul that david was fled to gath and he sought no more again for him and david said unto achish if i have now found grace in thine eyes let them give me a place in some town in the country that i may dwell there for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee then achish gave him ziklag that day wherefore ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of judah unto this day and the time that david dwelt in the country of the philistines was a full year and four months and david and his men went up and invaded the geshurites and the gezrites and the amalekites for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land as thou goest to shur even unto the land of egypt and david smote the land and left neither man nor woman alive and took away the sheep and the oxen and the asses and the camels and the apparel and returned and came to achish and achish said whither have ye made a road to day and david said against the south of judah and against the south of the jerahmeelites and against the south of the kenites and david saved neither man nor woman alive to bring tidings to gath saying lest they should tell on us saying so did david and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the philistines and achish believed david saying he hath made his people israel utterly to abhor him therefore he shall be my servant for ever and it came to pass in those days that the philistines gathered their armies together for warfare to fight with israel and achish said unto david know thou assuredly that thou shalt go out
