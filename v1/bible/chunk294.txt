bring up also king solomon and all the congregation of israel that were assembled unto him before the ark sacrificed sheep and oxen which could not be told nor numbered for multitude and the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the lord unto his place to the oracle of the house into the most holy place even under the wings of the cherubims for the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the ark and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above and they drew out the staves of the ark that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle but they were not seen without and there it is unto this day there was nothing in the ark save the two tables which moses put therein at horeb when the lord made a covenant with the children of israel when they came out of egypt and it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place for all the priests that were present were sanctified and did not then wait by course also the levites which were the singers all of them of asaph of heman of jeduthun with their sons and their brethren being arrayed in white linen having cymbals and psalteries and harps stood at the east end of the altar and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets it came even to pass as the trumpeters and singers were as one to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the lord and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick and praised the lord saying for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever that then the house was filled with a cloud even the house of the lord so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of the lord had filled the house of god then said solomon the lord hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness but i have built an house of habitation for thee and a place for thy dwelling for ever and the king turned his face and blessed the whole congregation of israel and all the congregation of israel stood and he said blessed be the lord god of israel who hath with his hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my father david saying since the day that i brought forth my people out of the land of egypt i chose no city among all the tribes of israel to build an house in that my name might be there neither chose i any man to be a ruler over my people israel but i have chosen jerusalem that my name might be there and have chosen david to be over my people israel now it was in the heart of david my father to build an house for the name of the lord god of israel but the lord said to david my father forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name thou didst well in that it was in thine heart notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house but thy son which shall come forth out of thy loins he shall build the house for my name the lord therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken for i am risen up in the room of david my father and am set on the throne of israel as the lord promised and have built the house for the name of the lord god of israel and in it have i put the ark wherein is the covenant of the lord that he made with the children of israel and he stood before the altar of the lord in the presence of all the congregation of israel and spread forth his hands for solomon had made a brasen scaffold of five cubits long and five cubits broad and three cubits high and had set it in the midst of the court and upon it he stood and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of israel and spread forth his hands toward heaven and said o lord god of israel there is no god like thee in the heaven nor in the earth which keepest covenant and shewest mercy unto thy servants that walk before thee with all their hearts thou which hast kept with thy servant david my father that which thou hast promised him and spakest with thy mouth and hast fulfilled it with thine hand as it is this day now therefore o lord god of israel keep with thy servant david my father that which thou hast promised him saying there shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of israel yet so that thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law as thou hast walked before me now then o lord god of israel let thy word be verified which thou hast spoken unto thy servant david but will god in very deed dwell with men on the earth behold heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee how much less this house which i have built have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant and to his supplication o lord my god to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee that thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night upon the place

people israel which they shall make toward this place hear thou from thy dwelling place even from heaven and when thou hearest forgive if a man sin against his neighbour and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear and the oath come before thine altar in this house then hear thou from heaven and do and judge thy servants by requiting the wicked by recompensing his way upon his own head and by justifying the righteous by giving him according to his righteousness and if
