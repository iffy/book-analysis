of the lord of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims and they set the ark of god upon a new cart and brought it out of the house of abinadab that was in gibeah and uzzah and ahio the sons of abinadab drave the new cart and they brought it out of the house of abinadab which was at gibeah accompanying the ark of god and ahio went before the ark and david and all the house of israel played before the lord on all manner of instruments made of fir wood even on harps and on psalteries and on timbrels and on cornets and on cymbals and when they came to nachons threshingfloor uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of god and took hold of it for the oxen shook it and the anger of the lord was kindled against uzzah and god smote him there for his error and there he died by the ark of god and david was displeased because the lord had made a breach upon uzzah and he called the name of the place perezuzzah to this day and david was afraid of the lord that day and said how shall the ark of the lord come to me so david would not remove the ark of the lord unto him into the city of david but david carried it aside into the house of obededom the gittite and the ark of the lord continued in the house of obededom the gittite three months and the lord blessed obededom and all his household and it was told king david saying the lord hath blessed the house of obededom and all that pertaineth unto him because of the ark of god so david went and brought up the ark of god from the house of obededom into the city of david with gladness and it was so that when they that bare the ark of the lord had gone six paces he sacrificed oxen and fatlings and david danced before the lord with all his might and david was girded with a linen ephod so david and all the house of israel brought up the ark of the lord with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet and as the ark of the lord came into the city of david michal sauls daughter looked through a window and saw king david leaping and dancing before the lord and she despised him in her heart and they brought in the ark of the lord and set it in his place in the midst of the tabernacle that david had pitched for it and david offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the lord and as soon as david had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings he blessed the people in the name of the lord of hosts and he dealt among all the people even among the whole multitude of israel as well to the women as men to every one a cake of bread and a good piece of flesh and a flagon of wine so all the people departed every one to his house then david returned to bless his household and michal the daughter of saul came out to meet david and said how glorious was the king of israel to day who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself and david said unto michal it was before the lord which chose me before thy father and before all his house to appoint me ruler over the people of the lord over israel therefore will i play before the lord and i will yet be more vile than thus and will be base in mine own sight and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of of them shall i be had in honour therefore michal the daughter of saul had no child unto the day of her death and it came to pass when the king sat in his house and the lord had given him rest round about from all his enemies that the king said unto nathan the prophet see now i dwell in an house of cedar but the ark of god dwelleth within curtains and nathan said to the king go do all that is in thine heart for the lord is with thee and it came to pass that night that the word of the lord came unto nathan saying go and tell my servant david thus saith the lord shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in whereas i have not dwelt in any house since the time that i brought up the children of israel out of egypt even to this day but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle in all the places wherein i have walked with all the children of israel spake i a word with any of the tribes of israel whom i commanded to feed my people israel saying why build ye not me an house of cedar now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant david thus saith the lord of hosts i took thee from the sheepcote from following the sheep to be ruler over my people over israel and i was with thee whithersoever thou wentest and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight and have made thee a great name like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth moreover i will appoint a place for my people israel and will plant them that they may dwell in a place of their own and move no more neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more as beforetime and as since the time that i commanded judges to be over my people israel and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies also the lord telleth thee that he will make thee an house and when thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers i will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowels and i will establish his kingdom he shall build an house for my name and i will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever i will be his father and he shall be my
