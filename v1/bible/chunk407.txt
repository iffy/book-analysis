the day of thy calamity for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off my son be wise and make my heart glad that i may answer him that reproacheth me a prudent man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself but the simple pass on and are punished take his garment that is surety for a stranger and take a pledge of him for a strange woman he that blesseth his friend with a loud voice rising early in the morning it shall be counted a curse to him a continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike whosoever hideth her hideth the wind and the ointment of his right hand which bewrayeth itself iron sharpeneth iron so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured as in water face answereth to face so the heart of man to man hell and destruction are never full so the eyes of man are never satisfied as the fining pot for silver and the furnace for gold so is a man to his praise though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle yet will not his foolishness depart from him be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks and look well to thy herds for riches are not for ever and doth the crown endure to every generation the hay appeareth and the tender grass sheweth itself and herbs of the mountains are gathered the lambs are for thy clothing and the goats are the price of the field and thou shalt have goats milk enough for thy food for the food of thy household and for the maintenance for thy maidens the wicked flee when no man pursueth but the righteous are bold as a lion for the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged a poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food they that forsake the law praise the wicked but such as keep the law contend with them evil men understand not judgment but they that seek the lord understand all things better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness than he that is perverse in his ways though he be rich whoso keepeth the law is a wise son but he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father he that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor he that turneth away his ear from hearing the law even his prayer shall be abomination whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way he shall fall himself into his own pit but the upright shall have good things in possession the rich man is wise in his own conceit but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out when righteous men do rejoice there is great glory but when the wicked rise a man is hidden he that covereth his sins shall not prosper but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy happy is the man that feareth alway but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief as a roaring lion and a ranging bear so is a wicked ruler over the poor people the prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days a man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall flee to the pit let no man stay him whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once he that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread but he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough a faithful man shall abound with blessings but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent to have respect of persons is not good for for a piece of bread that man will transgress he that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him he that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue whoso robbeth his father or his mother and saith it is no transgression the same is the companion of a destroyer he that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife but he that putteth his trust in the lord shall be made fat he that trusteth in his own heart is a fool but whoso walketh wisely he shall be delivered he that giveth unto the poor shall not lack but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse when the wicked rise men hide themselves but when they perish the righteous increase he that being often reproved hardeneth his neck shall suddenly be destroyed and that without remedy when the righteous are in authority the people rejoice but when the wicked beareth rule the people mourn whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth his substance the king by judgment establisheth the land but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it a man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet in the transgression of an evil man there is a snare but the righteous doth sing and rejoice the righteous considereth the cause of the poor but the wicked regardeth not to know it scornful men bring a city into a snare but wise men turn away wrath if a wise man contendeth with a foolish man whether he rage or laugh there is no rest the bloodthirsty hate the upright but the just seek his soul a fool uttereth all his mind but a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards if a ruler hearken to lies all his servants are wicked the poor and the deceitful man meet together the lord lighteneth both their eyes the king that faithfully judgeth the poor his throne shall be established for ever the rod and reproof give wisdom but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame when the wicked are multiplied transgression increaseth but the
