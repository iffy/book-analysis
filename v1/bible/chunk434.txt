none shall pass through it for ever and ever but the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion and the stones of emptiness they shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom but none shall be there and all her princes shall be nothing and thorns shall come up in her palaces nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof and it shall be an habitation of dragons and a court for owls the wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island and the satyr shall cry to his fellow the screech owl also shall rest there and find for herself a place of rest there shall the great owl make her nest and lay and hatch and gather under her shadow there shall the vultures also be gathered every one with her mate seek ye out of the book of the lord and read no one of these shall fail none shall want her mate for my mouth it hath commanded and his spirit it hath gathered them and he hath cast the lot for them and his hand hath divided it unto them by line they shall possess it for ever from generation to generation shall they dwell therein the wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose it shall blossom abundantly and rejoice even with joy and singing the glory of lebanon shall be given unto it the excellency of carmel and sharon they shall see the glory of the lord and the excellency of our god strengthen ye the weak hands and confirm the feeble knees say to them that are of a fearful heart be strong fear not behold your god will come with vengeance even god with a recompence he will come and save you then the eyes of the blind shall be opened and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped then shall the lame man leap as an hart and the tongue of the dumb sing for in the wilderness shall waters break out and streams in the desert and the parched ground shall become a pool and the thirsty land springs of water in the habitation of dragons where each lay shall be grass with reeds and rushes and an highway shall be there and a way and it shall be called the way of holiness the unclean shall not pass over it but it shall be for those the wayfaring men though fools shall not err therein no lion shall be there nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon it shall not be found there but the redeemed shall walk there and the ransomed of the lord shall return and come to zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads they shall obtain joy and gladness and sorrow and sighing shall flee away now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah that sennacherib king of assyria came up against all the defenced cities of judah and took them and the king of assyria sent rabshakeh from lachish to jerusalem unto king hezekiah with a great army and he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fullers field then came forth unto him eliakim hilkiahs son which was over the house and shebna the scribe and joah asaphs son the recorder and rabshakeh said unto them say ye now to hezekiah thus saith the great king the king of assyria what confidence is this wherein thou trustest i say sayest thou but they are but vain words i have counsel and strength for war now on whom dost thou trust that thou rebellest against me lo thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed on egypt whereon if a man lean it will go into his hand and pierce it so is pharaoh king of egypt to all that trust in him but if thou say to me we trust in the lord our god is it not he whose high places and whose altars hezekiah hath taken away and said to judah and to jerusalem ye shall worship before this altar now therefore give pledges i pray thee to my master the king of assyria and i will give thee two thousand horses if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my masters servants and put thy trust on egypt for chariots and for horsemen and am i now come up without the lord against this land to destroy it the lord said unto me go up against this land and destroy it then said eliakim and shebna and joah unto rabshakeh speak i pray thee unto thy servants in the syrian language for we understand it and speak not to us in the jews language in the ears of the people that are on the wall but rabshakeh said hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall that they may eat their own dung and drink their own piss with you then rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the jews language and said hear ye the words of the great king the king of assyria thus saith the king let not hezekiah deceive you for he shall not be able to deliver you neither let hezekiah make you trust in the lord saying the lord will surely deliver us this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of assyria hearken not to hezekiah for thus saith the king of assyria make an agreement with me by a present and come out to me and eat ye every one of his vine and every one of his fig tree and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern until i come and take you away to a land like your own land a land of corn and wine a land of bread and vineyards beware lest hezekiah persuade you saying the lord will deliver us hath any
