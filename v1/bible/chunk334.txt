with sweet odours and with other things for the purifying of the women then thus came every maiden unto the king whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the kings house in the evening she went and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women to the custody of shaashgaz the kings chamberlain which kept the concubines she came in unto the king no more except the king delighted in her and that she were called by name now when the turn of esther the daughter of abihail the uncle of mordecai who had taken her for his daughter was come to go in unto the king she required nothing but what hegai the kings chamberlain the keeper of the women appointed and esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her so esther was taken unto king ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month which is the month tebeth in the seventh year of his reign and the king loved esther above all the women and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins so that he set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of vashti then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants even esthers feast and he made a release to the provinces and gave gifts according to the state of the king and when the virgins were gathered together the second time then mordecai sat in the kings gate esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people as mordecai had charged her for esther did the commandment of mordecai like as when she was brought up with him in those days while mordecai sat in the kings gate two of the kings chamberlains bigthan and teresh of those which kept the door were wroth and sought to lay hands on the king ahasuerus and the thing was known to mordecai who told it unto esther the queen and esther certified the king thereof in mordecais name and when inquisition was made of the matter it was found out therefore they were both hanged on a tree and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king after these things did king ahasuerus promote haman the son of hammedatha the agagite and advanced him and set his seat above all the princes that were with him and all the kings servants that were in the kings gate bowed and reverenced haman for the king had so commanded concerning him but mordecai bowed not nor did him reverence then the kings servants which were in the kings gate said unto mordecai why transgressest thou the kings commandment now it came to pass when they spake daily unto him and he hearkened not unto them that they told haman to see whether mordecais matters would stand for he had told them that he was a jew and when haman saw that mordecai bowed not nor did him reverence then was haman full of wrath and he thought scorn to lay hands on mordecai alone for they had shewed him the people of mordecai wherefore haman sought to destroy all the jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of ahasuerus even the people of mordecai in the first month that is the month nisan in the twelfth year of king ahasuerus they cast pur that is the lot before haman from day to day and from month to month to the twelfth month that is the month adar and haman said unto king ahasuerus there is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom and their laws are diverse from all people neither keep they the kings laws therefore it is not for the kings profit to suffer them if it please the king let it be written that they may be destroyed and i will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business to bring it into the kings treasuries and the king took his ring from his hand and gave it unto haman the son of hammedatha the agagite the jews enemy and the king said unto haman the silver is given to thee the people also to do with them as it seemeth good to thee then were the kings scribes called
