murderer which is guilty of death but he shall be surely put to death and ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge that he should come again to dwell in the land until the death of the priest so ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are for blood it defileth the land and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein but by the blood of him that shed it defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit wherein i dwell for i the lord dwell among the children of israel and the chief fathers of the families of the children of gilead the son of machir the son of manasseh of the families of the sons of joseph came near and spake before moses and before the princes the chief fathers of the children of israel and they said the lord commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of israel and my lord was commanded by the lord to give the inheritance of zelophehad our brother unto his daughters and if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of israel then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance and when the jubile of the children of israel shall be then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers and moses commanded the children of israel according to the word of the lord saying the tribe of the sons of joseph hath said well this is the thing which the lord doth command concerning the daughters of zelophehad saying let them marry to whom they think best only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry so shall not the inheritance of the children of israel remove from tribe to tribe for every one of the children of israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers and every daughter that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of israel shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father that the children of israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe but every one of the tribes of the children of israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance even as the lord commanded moses so did the daughters of zelophehad for mahlah tirzah and hoglah and milcah and noah the daughters of zelophehad were married unto their fathers brothers sons and they were married into the families of the sons of manasseh the son of joseph and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father these are the commandments and the judgments which the lord commanded by the hand of moses unto the children of israel in the plains of moab by jordan near jericho the fifth book of moses called deuteronomy these be the words which moses spake unto all israel on this side jordan in the wilderness in the plain over against the red sea between paran and tophel and laban and hazeroth and dizahab there are eleven days journey from horeb by the way of mount seir unto kadeshbarnea and it came to pass in the fortieth year in the eleventh month on the first day of the month that moses spake unto the children of israel according unto all that the lord had given him in commandment unto them after he had slain sihon the king of the amorites which dwelt in heshbon and og the king of bashan which dwelt at astaroth in edrei on this side jordan in the land of moab began moses to declare this law saying the lord our god spake unto us in horeb saying ye have dwelt long enough in this mount turn you and take your journey and go to the mount of the amorites and unto all the places nigh thereunto in the plain in the hills and in the vale and in the south and by the sea side to the land of the canaanites and unto lebanon unto the great river the river euphrates behold i have set the land before you go in and possess the land which the lord sware unto your fathers abraham isaac and jacob to give unto them and to their seed after them and i spake unto you at that time saying i am not able to bear you myself alone the lord your god hath multiplied you and behold ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude the lord god of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are and bless you as he hath promised you how can i myself alone bear your cumbrance and your burden and your strife take you wise men and understanding and known among your tribes and i will make them rulers over you and ye answered me and said the thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do so i took the chief of your tribes wise men and known and made them heads over you captains over thousands and captains over hundreds and captains over fifties and captains over tens and officers among your tribes and i charged your judges at that time saying hear the causes between your brethren and judge righteously between every man and his brother and the stranger that is with him ye shall not respect persons in judgment but ye shall hear the small as well as the great ye shall not be afraid of the face of man for the judgment is gods and the cause that is too hard for you bring it unto me and i will hear it and i commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do and when we departed from horeb we went through all that great and terrible wilderness which ye saw by
