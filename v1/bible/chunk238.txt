to one target and he made three hundred shields of beaten gold three pound of gold went to one shield and the king put them in the house of the forest of lebanon moreover the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with the best gold the throne had six steps and the top of the throne was round behind and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat and two lions stood beside the stays and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps there was not the like made in any kingdom and all king solomons drinking vessels were of gold and all the vessels of the house of the forest of lebanon were of pure gold none were of silver it was nothing accounted of in the days of solomon for the king had at sea a navy of tharshish with the navy of hiram once in three years came the navy of tharshish bringing gold and silver ivory and apes and peacocks so king solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom and all the earth sought to solomon to hear his wisdom which god had put in his heart and they brought every man his present vessels of silver and vessels of gold and garments and armour and spices horses and mules a rate year by year and solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots and with the king at jerusalem and the king made silver to be in jerusalem as stones and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for abundance and solomon had horses brought out of egypt and linen yarn the kings merchants received the linen yarn at a price and a chariot came up and went out of egypt for six hundred shekels of silver and an horse for an hundred and fifty and so for all the kings of the hittites and for the kings of syria did they bring them out by their means but king solomon loved many strange women together with the daughter of pharaoh women of the moabites ammonites edomites zidonians and hittites of the nations concerning which the lord said unto the children of israel ye shall not go in to them neither shall they come in unto you for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods solomon clave unto these in love and he had seven hundred wives princesses and three hundred concubines and his wives turned away his heart for it came to pass when solomon was old that his wives turned away his heart after other gods and his heart was not perfect with the lord his god as was the heart of david his father for solomon went after ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians and after milcom the abomination of the ammonites and solomon did evil in the sight of the lord and went not fully after the lord as did david his father then did solomon build an high place for chemosh the abomination of moab in the hill that is before jerusalem and for molech the abomination of the children of ammon and likewise did he for all his strange wives which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods and the lord was angry with solomon because his heart was turned from the lord god of israel which had appeared unto him twice and had commanded him concerning this thing that he should not go after other gods but he kept not that which the lord commanded wherefore the lord said unto solomon forasmuch as this is done of thee and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes which i have commanded thee i will surely rend the kingdom from thee and will give it to thy servant notwithstanding in thy days i will not do it for david thy fathers sake but i will rend it out of the hand of thy son howbeit i will not rend away all the kingdom but will give one tribe to thy son for david my servants sake and for jerusalems sake which i have chosen and the lord stirred up an adversary unto solomon hadad the edomite he was of the kings seed in edom for it came to pass when david was in edom and joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain after he had smitten every male in edom for six months did joab remain there with all israel until he had cut off every male in edom that hadad fled he and certain edomites of his fathers servants with him to go into egypt hadad being yet a little child and they arose out of midian and came to paran and they took men with them out of paran and they came to egypt unto pharaoh king of egypt which gave him an house and appointed him victuals and gave him land and hadad found great favour in the sight of pharaoh so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife the sister of tahpenes the queen and the sister of tahpenes bare him genubath his son whom tahpenes weaned in pharaohs house and genubath was in pharaohs household among the sons of pharaoh and when hadad heard in egypt that david slept with his fathers and that joab the captain of the host was dead hadad said to pharaoh let me depart that i may go to mine own country then pharaoh said unto him but what hast thou lacked with me that behold thou seekest to go to thine own country and he answered nothing howbeit let me go in any wise and god stirred him up another adversary rezon the son of eliadah which fled from his lord hadadezer king of zobah and he gathered men unto him and became captain over a band when david slew them of zobah and they went to damascus and dwelt therein and reigned in damascus and he was an adversary to israel all the days of solomon beside the mischief that hadad did and he abhorred israel and reigned over syria and
