the one was baanah and the name of the other rechab the sons of rimmon a beerothite of the children of benjamin for beeroth also was reckoned to benjamin and the beerothites fled to gittaim and were sojourners there until this day and jonathan sauls son had a son that was lame of his feet he was five years old when the tidings came of saul and jonathan out of jezreel and his nurse took him up and fled and it came to pass as she made haste to flee that he fell and became lame and his name was mephibosheth and the sons of rimmon the beerothite rechab and baanah went and came about the heat of the day to the house of ishbosheth who lay on a bed at noon and they came thither into the midst of the house as though they would have fetched wheat and they smote him under the fifth rib and rechab and baanah his brother escaped for when they came into the house he lay on his bed in his bedchamber and they smote him and slew him and beheaded him and took his head and gat them away through the plain all night and they brought the head of ishbosheth unto david to hebron and said to the king behold the head of ishbosheth the son of saul thine enemy which sought thy life and the lord hath avenged my lord the king this day of saul and of his seed and david answered rechab and baanah his brother the sons of rimmon the beerothite and said unto them as the lord liveth who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity when one told me saying behold saul is dead thinking to have brought good tidings i took hold of him and slew him in ziklag who thought that i would have given him a reward for his tidings how much more when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed shall i not therefore now require his blood of your hand and take you away from the earth and david commanded his young men and they slew them and cut off their hands and their feet and hanged them up over the pool in hebron but they took the head of ishbosheth and buried it in the sepulchre of abner in hebron then came all the tribes of israel to david unto hebron and spake saying behold we are thy bone and thy flesh also in time past when saul was king over us thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in israel and the lord said to thee thou shalt feed my people israel and thou shalt be a captain over israel so all the elders of israel came to the king to hebron and king david made a league with them in hebron before the lord and they anointed david king over israel david was thirty years old when he began to reign and he reigned forty years in hebron he reigned over judah seven years and six months and in jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all israel and judah and the king and his men went to jerusalem unto the jebusites the inhabitants of the land which spake unto david saying except thou take away the blind and the lame thou shalt not come in hither thinking david cannot come in hither nevertheless david took the strong hold of zion the same is the city of david and david said on that day whosoever getteth up to the gutter and smiteth the jebusites and the lame and the blind that are hated of davids soul he shall be chief and captain wherefore they said the blind and the lame shall not come into the house so david dwelt in the fort and called it the city of david and david built round about from millo and inward and david went on and grew great and the lord god of hosts was with him and hiram king of tyre sent messengers to david and cedar trees and carpenters and masons and they built david an house and david perceived that the lord had established him king over israel and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people israels sake and david took him more concubines and wives out of jerusalem after he was come from hebron and there were yet sons and daughters born to david and these be the names of those that were born unto him in jerusalem shammuah and shobab and nathan and solomon ibhar also and elishua and nepheg and japhia and elishama and eliada and eliphalet but when the philistines heard that they had anointed david king over israel all the philistines came up to seek david and david heard of it and went down to the hold the philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of rephaim and david enquired of the lord saying shall i go up to the philistines wilt thou deliver them into mine hand and the lord said unto david go up for i will doubtless deliver the philistines into thine hand and david came to baalperazim and david smote them there and said the lord hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me as the breach of waters therefore he called the name of that place baalperazim and there they left their images and david and his men burned them and the philistines came up yet again and spread themselves in the valley of rephaim and when david enquired of the lord he said thou shalt not go up but fetch a compass behind them and come upon them over against the mulberry trees and let it be when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees that then thou shalt bestir thyself for then shall the lord go out before thee to smite the host of the philistines and david did so as the lord had commanded him and smote the philistines from geba until thou come to gazer again david gathered together all the chosen men of israel thirty thousand and david arose and went with all the people that were with him from baale of judah to bring up from thence the ark of god whose name is called by the name
