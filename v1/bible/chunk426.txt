and to the charmers and to them that have familiar spirits and to the wizards and the egyptians will i give over into the hand of a cruel lord and a fierce king shall rule over them saith the lord the lord of hosts and the waters shall fail from the sea and the river shall be wasted and dried up and they shall turn the rivers far away and the brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up the reeds and flags shall wither the paper reeds by the brooks by the mouth of the brooks and every thing sown by the brooks shall wither be driven away and be no more the fishers also shall mourn and all they that cast angle into the brooks shall lament and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish moreover they that work in fine flax and they that weave networks shall be confounded and they shall be broken in the purposes thereof all that make sluices and ponds for fish surely the princes of zoan are fools the counsel of the wise counsellors of pharaoh is become brutish how say ye unto pharaoh i am the son of the wise the son of ancient kings where are they where are thy wise men and let them tell thee now and let them know what the lord of hosts hath purposed upon egypt the princes of zoan are become fools the princes of noph are deceived they have also seduced egypt even they that are the stay of the tribes thereof the lord hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof and they have caused egypt to err in every work thereof as a drunken man staggereth in his vomit neither shall there be any work for egypt which the head or tail branch or rush may do in that day shall egypt be like unto women and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the lord of hosts which he shaketh over it and the land of judah shall be a terror unto egypt every one that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself because of the counsel of the lord of hosts which he hath determined against it in that day shall five cities in the land of egypt speak the language of canaan and swear to the lord of hosts one shall be called the city of destruction in that day shall there be an altar to the lord in the midst of the land of egypt and a pillar at the border thereof to the lord and it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the lord of hosts in the land of egypt for they shall cry unto the lord because of the oppressors and he shall send them a saviour and a great one and he shall deliver them and the lord shall be known to egypt and the egyptians shall know the lord in that day and shall do sacrifice and oblation yea they shall vow a vow unto the lord and perform it and the lord shall smite egypt he shall smite and heal it and they shall return even to the lord and he shall be intreated of them and shall heal them in that day shall there be a highway out of egypt to assyria and the assyrian shall come into egypt and the egyptian into assyria and the egyptians shall serve with the assyrians in that day shall israel be the third with egypt and with assyria even a blessing in the midst of the land whom the lord of hosts shall bless saying blessed be egypt my people and assyria the work of my hands and israel mine inheritance in the year that tartan came unto ashdod when sargon the king of assyria sent him and fought against ashdod and took it at the same time spake the lord by isaiah the son of amoz saying go and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins and put off thy shoe from thy foot and he did so walking naked and barefoot and the lord said like as my servant isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and wonder upon egypt and upon ethiopia so shall the king of assyria lead away the egyptians prisoners and the ethiopians captives young and old naked and barefoot even with their buttocks uncovered to the shame of egypt and they shall be afraid and ashamed of ethiopia their expectation and of egypt their glory and the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day behold such is our expectation whither we flee for help to be delivered from the king of assyria and how shall we escape the burden of the desert of the sea as whirlwinds in the south pass through so it cometh from the desert from a terrible land a grievous vision is declared unto me the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously and the spoiler spoileth go up o elam besiege o media all the sighing thereof
