live saith the lord god they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters they only shall be delivered but the land shall be desolate or if i bring a sword upon that land and say sword go through the land so that i cut off man and beast from it though these three men were in it as i live saith the lord god they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters but they only shall be delivered themselves or if i send a pestilence into that land and pour out my fury upon it in blood to cut off from it man and beast though noah daniel and job were in it as i live saith the lord god they shall deliver neither son nor daughter they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness for thus saith the lord god how much more when i send my four sore judgments upon jerusalem the sword and the famine and the noisome beast and the pestilence to cut off from it man and beast yet behold therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth both sons and daughters behold they shall come forth unto you and ye shall see their way and their doings and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that i have brought upon jerusalem even concerning all that i have brought upon it and they shall comfort you when ye see their ways and their doings and ye shall know that i have not done without cause all that i have done in it saith the lord god and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man what is the vine tree more than any tree or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest shall wood be taken thereof to do any work or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon behold it is cast into the fire for fuel the fire devoureth both the ends of it and the midst of it is burned is it meet for any work behold when it was whole it was meet for no work how much less shall it be meet yet for any work when the fire hath devoured it and it is burned therefore thus saith the lord god as the vine tree among the trees of the forest which i have given to the fire for fuel so will i give the inhabitants of jerusalem and i will set my face against them they shall go out from one fire and another fire shall devour them and ye shall know that i am the lord when i set my face against them and i will make the land desolate because they have committed a trespass saith the lord god again the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man cause jerusalem to know her abominations and say thus saith the lord god unto jerusalem thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of canaan thy father was an amorite and thy mother an hittite and as for thy nativity in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee thou wast not salted at all nor swaddled at all none eye pitied thee to do any of these unto thee to have compassion upon thee but thou wast cast out in the open field to the lothing of thy person in the day that thou wast born and when i passed by thee and saw thee polluted in thine own blood i said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood live yea i said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood live i have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field and thou hast increased and waxen great and thou art come to excellent ornaments thy breasts are fashioned and thine hair is grown whereas thou wast naked and bare now when i passed by thee and looked upon thee behold thy time was the time of love and i spread my skirt over thee and covered thy nakedness yea i sware unto thee and entered into a covenant with thee saith the lord god and thou becamest mine then washed i thee with water yea i throughly washed away thy blood from thee and i anointed thee with oil i clothed thee also with broidered work and shod thee with badgers skin and i girded thee about with fine linen and i covered thee with silk i decked thee also with ornaments and i put bracelets upon thy hands and a chain on thy neck and i put a jewel on thy forehead and earrings in thine ears and a beautiful crown upon thine head thus wast thou decked with gold and silver and thy raiment was of fine linen and silk and broidered work thou didst eat fine flour and honey and oil and thou wast exceeding beautiful and thou didst prosper into a kingdom and thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty for it was perfect through my comeliness which i had put upon thee saith the lord god but thou didst trust in thine

divers colours and playedst the harlot thereupon the like things shall not come neither shall it be so thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver which i had given thee and madest to thyself images of men and didst commit whoredom with them and tookest thy broidered garments and coveredst them and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them my meat also which i gave thee fine flour and oil and honey wherewith i fed thee thou hast even set it before them for a sweet savour and thus it was saith the lord god moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters
