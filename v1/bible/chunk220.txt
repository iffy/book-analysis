curse david who shall then say wherefore hast thou done so and david said to abishai and to all his servants behold my son which came forth of my bowels seeketh my life how much more now may this benjamite do it let him alone and let him curse for the lord hath bidden him it may be that the lord will look on mine affliction and that the lord will requite me good for his cursing this day and as david and his men went by the way shimei went along on the hills side over against him and cursed as he went and threw stones at him and cast dust and the king and all the people that were with him came weary and refreshed themselves there and absalom and all the people the men of israel came to jerusalem and ahithophel with him and it came to pass when hushai the archite davids friend was come unto absalom that hushai said unto absalom god save the king god save the king and absalom said to hushai is this thy kindness to thy friend why wentest thou not with thy friend and hushai said unto absalom nay but whom the lord and this people and all the men of israel choose his will i be and with him will i abide and again whom should i serve should i not serve in the presence of his son as i have served in thy fathers presence so will i be in thy presence then said absalom to ahithophel give counsel among you what we shall do and ahithophel said unto absalom go in unto thy fathers concubines which he hath left to keep the house and all israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong so they spread absalom a tent upon the top of the house and absalom went in unto his fathers concubines in the sight of all israel and the counsel of ahithophel which he counselled in those days was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of god so was all the counsel of ahithophel both with david and with absalom moreover ahithophel said unto absalom let me now choose out twelve thousand men and i will arise and pursue after david this night and i will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed and will make him afraid and all the people that are with him shall flee and i will smite the king only and i will bring back all the people unto thee the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned so all the people shall be in peace and the saying pleased absalom well and all the elders of israel then said absalom call now hushai the archite also and let us hear likewise what he saith and when hushai was come to absalom absalom spake unto him saying ahithophel hath spoken after this manner shall we do after his saying if not speak thou and hushai said unto absalom the counsel that ahithophel hath given is not good at this time for said hushai thou knowest thy father and his men that they be mighty men and they be chafed in their minds as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field and thy father is a man of war and will not lodge with the people behold he is hid now in some pit or in some other place and it will come to pass when some of them be overthrown at the first that whosoever heareth it will say there is a slaughter among the people that follow absalom and he also that is valiant whose heart is as the heart of a lion shall utterly melt for all israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man and they which be with him are valiant men therefore i counsel that all israel be generally gathered unto thee from dan even to beersheba as the sand that is by the sea for multitude and that thou go to battle in thine own person so shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one moreover if he be gotten into a city then shall all israel bring ropes to that city and we will draw it into the river until there be not one small stone found there and absalom and all the men of israel said the counsel of hushai the archite is better than the counsel of ahithophel for the lord had appointed to defeat the good counsel of ahithophel to the intent that the lord might bring evil upon absalom then said hushai unto zadok and to abiathar the priests thus and thus did ahithophel counsel absalom and the elders of israel and thus and thus have i counselled now therefore send quickly and tell david saying lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness but speedily pass over lest the king be swallowed up and all the people that are with him now jonathan and ahimaaz stayed by enrogel for they might not be seen to come into the city and a wench went and told them and they went and told king david nevertheless a lad saw them and told absalom but they went both of them away quickly and came to a mans house in bahurim which had a well in his court whither they went down and the woman took and spread a covering over the wells mouth and spread ground corn thereon and the thing was not known and when absaloms servants came to the woman to the house they said where is ahimaaz and jonathan and the woman said unto them they be gone over the brook of water and when they had sought and could not find them they returned to jerusalem and it came to pass after they were departed that they came up out of the well and went and told king david and said unto david arise and pass quickly over the water for thus hath ahithophel counselled against you then david
