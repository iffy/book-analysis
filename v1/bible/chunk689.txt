some man will say how are the dead raised up and with what body do they come thou fool that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die and that which thou sowest thou sowest not that body that shall be but bare grain it may chance of wheat or of some other grain but god giveth it a body as it hath pleased him and to every seed his own body all flesh is not the same flesh but there is one kind of flesh of men another flesh of beasts another of fishes and another of birds there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars for one star differeth from another star in glory so also is the resurrection of the dead it is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption it is sown in dishonour it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body and so it is written the first man adam was made a living soul the last adam was made a quickening spirit howbeit that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the lord from heaven as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy and as is the heavenly such are they also that are heavenly and as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the heavenly now this i say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god neither doth corruption inherit incorruption behold i shew you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory o death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to god which giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ therefore my beloved brethren be ye stedfast unmoveable always abounding in the work of the lord forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the lord now concerning the collection for the saints as i have given order to the churches of galatia even so do ye upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store as god hath prospered him that there be no gatherings when i come and when i come whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters them will i send to bring your liberality unto jerusalem and if it be meet that i go also they shall go with me now i will come unto you when i shall pass through macedonia for i do pass through macedonia and it may be that i will abide yea and winter with you that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever i go for i will not see you now by the way but i trust to tarry a while with you if the lord permit but i will tarry at ephesus until pentecost for a great door and effectual is opened unto me and there are many adversaries now if timotheus come see that he may be with you without fear for he worketh the work of the lord as i also do let no man therefore despise him but conduct him forth in peace that he may come unto me for i look for him with the brethren as touching our brother apollos i greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren but his will was not at all to come at this time but he will come when he shall have convenient time watch ye stand fast in the faith quit you like men be strong let all your things be done with charity i beseech you brethren ye know the house of stephanas that it is the firstfruits of achaia and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints that ye submit yourselves unto such and to every one that helpeth with us and laboureth i am glad of the coming of stephanas and fortunatus and achaicus for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied for they have refreshed my spirit and yours therefore acknowledge ye them that are such the churches of asia salute you aquila and priscilla salute you much in the lord with the church that is in their house all the brethren greet you greet ye one another with an holy kiss the salutation of me paul with mine own hand if any man love not the lord jesus christ let him be anathema maranatha the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you my love be with you all in christ jesus

comfort who comforteth us in all our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of god for as the sufferings of christ abound in us so our consolation also aboundeth
