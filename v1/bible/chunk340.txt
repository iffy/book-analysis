trouble as the sparks fly upward i would seek unto god and unto god would i commit my cause which doeth great things and unsearchable marvellous things without number who giveth rain upon the earth and sendeth waters upon the fields to set up on high those that be low that those which mourn may be exalted to safety he disappointeth the devices of the crafty so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise he taketh the wise in their own craftiness and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong they meet with darkness in the day time and grope in the noonday as in the night but he saveth the poor from the sword from their mouth and from the hand of the mighty so the poor hath hope and iniquity stoppeth her mouth behold happy is the man whom god correcteth therefore despise not thou the chastening of the almighty for he maketh sore and bindeth up he woundeth and his hands make whole he shall deliver thee in six troubles yea in seven there shall no evil touch thee in famine he shall redeem thee from death and in war from the power of the sword thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh at destruction and famine thou shalt laugh neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth for thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee and thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace and thou shalt visit thy habitation and shalt not sin thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great and thine offspring as the grass of the earth thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season lo this we have searched it so it is hear it and know thou it for thy good but job answered and said oh that my grief were throughly weighed and my calamity laid in the balances together for now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea therefore my words are swallowed up for the arrows of the almighty are within me the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit the terrors of god do set themselves in array against me doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass or loweth the ox over his fodder can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt or is there any taste in the white of an egg the things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat oh that i might have my request and that god would grant me the thing that i long for even that it would please god to destroy me that he would let loose his hand and cut me off then should i yet have comfort yea i would harden myself in sorrow let him not spare for i have not concealed the words of the holy one what is my strength that i should hope and what is mine end that i should prolong my life is my strength the strength of stones or is my flesh of brass is not my help in me and is wisdom driven quite from me to him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend but he forsaketh the fear of the almighty my brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook and as the stream of brooks they pass away which are blackish by reason of the ice and wherein the snow is hid what time they wax warm they vanish when it is hot they are consumed out of their place the paths of their way are turned aside they go to nothing and perish the troops of tema looked the companies of sheba waited for them they were confounded because they had hoped they came thither and were ashamed for now ye are nothing ye see my casting down and are afraid did i say bring unto me or give a reward for me of your substance or deliver me from the enemys hand or redeem me from the hand of the mighty teach me and i will hold my tongue and cause me to understand wherein i have erred how forcible are right words but what doth your arguing reprove do ye imagine to reprove words and the speeches of one that is desperate which are as wind yea ye overwhelm the fatherless and ye dig a pit for your friend now therefore be content look upon me for it is evident unto you if i lie return i pray you let it not be iniquity yea return again my righteousness is in it is there iniquity in my tongue cannot my taste discern perverse things is there not an appointed time to man upon earth are not his days also like the days of an hireling as a servant earnestly desireth the shadow and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work so am i made to possess months of vanity and wearisome nights are appointed to me when i lie down i say when shall i arise and the night be gone and i am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day my flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust my skin is broken and become loathsome my days are swifter than a weavers shuttle and are spent without hope o remember that my life is wind mine eye shall no more see good the eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more thine eyes are upon me and i am not as the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more he shall return no more to his house neither shall his place know him any more therefore i will not refrain my mouth i will speak in the anguish of my spirit i will complain in the bitterness of my soul am i a sea or a whale that thou settest a watch over me when i say my bed shall comfort me my couch shall ease my complaints then thou scarest me
