of egypt we wot not what is become of him and i said unto them whosoever hath any gold let them break it off so they gave it me then i cast it into the fire and there came out this calf and when moses saw that the people were naked for aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies then moses stood in the gate of the camp and said who is on the lords side let him come unto me and all the sons of levi gathered themselves together unto him and he said unto them thus saith the lord god of israel put every man his sword by his side and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp and slay every man his brother and every man his companion and every man his neighbour and the children of levi did according to the word of moses and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men for moses had said consecrate yourselves today to the lord even every man upon his son and upon his brother that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day and it came to pass on the morrow that moses said unto the people ye have sinned a great sin and now i will go up unto the lord peradventure i shall make an atonement for your sin and moses returned unto the lord and said oh this people have sinned a great sin and have made them gods of gold yet now if thou wilt forgive their sin and if not blot me i pray thee out of thy book which thou hast written and the lord said unto moses whosoever hath sinned against me him will i blot out of my book therefore now go lead the people unto the place of which i have spoken unto thee behold mine angel shall go before thee nevertheless in the day when i visit i will visit their sin upon them and the lord plagued the people because they made the calf which aaron made and the lord said unto moses depart and go up hence thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of egypt unto the land which i sware unto abraham to isaac and to jacob saying unto thy seed will i give it and i will send an angel before thee and i will drive out the canaanite the amorite and the hittite and the perizzite the hivite and the jebusite unto a land flowing with milk and honey for i will not go up in the midst of thee for thou art a stiffnecked people lest i consume thee in the way and when the people heard these evil tidings they mourned and no man did put on him his ornaments for the lord had said unto moses say unto the children of israel ye are a stiffnecked people i will come up into the midst of thee in a moment and consume thee therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee that i may know what to do unto thee and the children of israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount horeb and moses took the tabernacle and pitched it without the camp afar off from the camp and called it the tabernacle of the congregation and it came to pass that every one which sought the lord went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation which was without the camp and it came to pass when moses went out unto the tabernacle that all the people rose up and stood every man at his tent door and looked after moses until he was gone into the tabernacle and it came to pass as moses entered into the tabernacle the cloudy pillar descended and stood at the door of the tabernacle and the lord talked with moses and all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door and all the people rose up and worshipped every man in his tent door and the lord spake unto moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend and he turned again into the camp but his servant joshua the son of nun a young man departed not out of the tabernacle and moses said unto the lord see thou sayest unto me bring up this people and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me yet thou hast said i know thee by name and thou hast also found grace in my sight now therefore i pray thee if i have found grace in thy sight shew me now thy way that i may know thee that i may find grace in thy sight and consider that this nation is thy people and he said my presence shall go with thee and i will give thee rest and he said unto him if thy presence go not with me carry us not up hence for wherein shall it be known here that i and thy people have found grace in thy sight is it not in that thou goest with us so shall we be separated i and thy people from all the people that are upon the face of the earth and the lord said unto moses i will do this thing also that thou hast spoken for thou hast found grace in my sight and i know thee by name and he said i beseech thee shew me thy glory and he said i will make all my goodness pass before thee and i will proclaim the name of the lord before thee and will be gracious to whom i will be gracious and will shew mercy on whom i will shew mercy and he said thou canst not see my face for there shall no man see me and live and the lord said behold there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock and it shall come to pass while my glory passeth by that i will put thee in a clift of the rock and will cover thee with my hand while i pass by and i will take away mine hand and thou shalt see my back parts but my face shall not be seen and the lord said unto moses
