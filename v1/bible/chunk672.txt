of the prophets from morning till evening and some believed the things which were spoken and some believed not and when they agreed not among themselves they departed after that paul had spoken one word well spake the holy ghost by esaias the prophet unto our fathers saying go unto this people and say hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and not perceive for the heart of this people is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes have they closed lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and should be converted and i should heal them be it known therefore unto you that the salvation of god is sent unto the gentiles and that they will hear it and when he had said these words the jews departed and had great reasoning among themselves and paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house and received all that came in unto him preaching the kingdom of god and teaching those things which concern the lord jesus christ with all confidence no man forbidding him the epistle of paul the apostle to the romans paul a servant of jesus christ called to be an apostle separated unto the gospel of god which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures concerning his son jesus christ our lord which was made of the seed of david according to the flesh and declared to be the son of god with power according to the spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead by whom we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith among all nations for his name among whom are ye also the called of jesus christ to all that be in rome beloved of god called to be saints grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ first i thank my god through jesus christ for you all that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world for god is my witness whom i serve with my spirit in the gospel of his son that without ceasing i make mention of you always in my prayers making request if by any means now at length i might have a prosperous journey by the will of god to come unto you for i long to see you that i may impart unto you some spiritual gift to the end ye may be established that is that i may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me now i would not have you ignorant brethren that oftentimes i purposed to come unto you but was let hitherto that i might have some fruit among you also even as among other gentiles i am debtor both to the greeks and to the barbarians both to the wise and to the unwise so as much as in me is i am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at rome also for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvation to every one that believeth to the jew first and also to the greek for therein is the righteousness of god revealed from faith to faith as it is written the just shall live by faith for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness because that which may be known of god is manifest in them for god hath shewed it unto them for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to corruptible man and to birds and fourfooted beasts and creeping things wherefore god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts to dishonour their own bodies between themselves who changed the truth of god into a lie and worshipped and served the creature more than the creator who is blessed for ever amen for this cause god gave them up unto vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignity whisperers backbiters haters of god despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents without understanding covenantbreakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful who knowing the judgment of god that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them therefore thou art inexcusable o man whosoever thou art that judgest for wherein thou judgest another thou condemnest thyself for thou that judgest doest the same things but we are sure that the judgment of god is according to truth against them which commit such things and thinkest thou this o man that judgest them which do such things and doest the same that thou shalt escape the judgment of god or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering not knowing that the goodness of god leadeth thee to repentance but after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of god who will render to every man according to his deeds to them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality eternal life but
