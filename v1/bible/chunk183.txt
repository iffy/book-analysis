when they were come to bethlehem that all the city was moved about them and they said is this naomi and she said unto them call me not naomi call me mara for the almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me i went out full and the lord hath brought me home again empty why then call ye me naomi seeing the lord hath testified against me and the almighty hath afflicted me so naomi returned and ruth the moabitess her daughter in law with her which returned out of the country of moab and they came to bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest and naomi had a kinsman of her husbands a mighty man of wealth of the family of elimelech and his name was boaz and ruth the moabitess said unto naomi let me now go to the field and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight i shall find grace and she said unto her go my daughter and she went and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto boaz who was of the kindred of elimelech and behold boaz came from bethlehem and said unto the reapers the lord be with you and they answered him the lord bless thee then said boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers whose damsel is this and the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said it is the moabitish damsel that came back with naomi out of the country of moab and she said i pray you let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves so she came and hath continued even from the morning until now that she tarried a little in the house then said boaz unto ruth hearest thou not my daughter go not to glean in another field neither go from hence but abide here fast by my maidens let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap and go thou after them have i not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee and when thou art athirst go unto the vessels and drink of that which the young men have drawn then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said unto him why have i found grace in thine eyes that thou shouldest take knowledge of me seeing i am a stranger and boaz answered and said unto her it hath fully been shewed me all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother and the land of thy nativity and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore the lord recompense thy work and a full reward be given thee of the lord god of israel under whose wings thou art come to trust then she said let me find favour in thy sight my lord for that thou hast comforted me and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid though i be not like unto one of thine handmaidens and boaz said unto her at mealtime come thou hither and eat of the bread and dip thy morsel in the vinegar and she sat beside the reapers and he reached her parched corn and she did eat and was sufficed and left and when she was risen up to glean boaz commanded his young men saying let her glean even among the sheaves and reproach her not and let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her and leave them that she may glean them and rebuke her not so she gleaned in the field until even and beat out that she had gleaned and it was about an ephah of barley and she took it up and went into the city and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned and she brought forth and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed and her mother in law said unto her where hast thou gleaned to day and where wroughtest thou blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee and she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought and said the mans name with whom i wrought to day is boaz and naomi said unto her daughter in law blessed be he of the lord who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead and naomi said unto her the man is near of kin unto us one of our next kinsmen and ruth the moabitess said he said unto me also thou shalt keep fast by my young men until they have ended all my harvest and naomi said unto ruth her daughter in law it is good my daughter that thou go out with his maidens that they meet thee not in any other field so she kept fast by the maidens of boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest and dwelt with her mother in law then naomi her mother in law said unto her my daughter shall i not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee and now is not boaz of our kindred with whose maidens thou wast behold he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor wash thyself therefore and anoint thee and put thy raiment upon thee and get thee down to the floor but make not thyself known unto the man until he shall have done eating and drinking and it shall be when he lieth down that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet and lay thee down and he will tell thee what thou shalt do and she said unto her all that thou sayest unto me i will do and she went down unto the floor and did according to all that her mother in law bade her and when boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn and she came softly and uncovered his feet and laid her down and it came to pass at midnight that
