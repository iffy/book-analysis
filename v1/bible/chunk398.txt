to her ways go not astray in her paths for she hath cast down many wounded yea many strong men have been slain by her her house is the way to hell going down to the chambers of death doth not wisdom cry and understanding put forth her voice she standeth in the top of high places by the way in the places of the paths she crieth at the gates at the entry of the city at the coming in at the doors unto you o men i call and my voice is to the sons of man o ye simple understand wisdom and ye fools be ye of an understanding heart hear for i will speak of excellent things and the opening of my lips shall be right things for my mouth shall speak truth and wickedness is an abomination to my lips all the words of my mouth are in righteousness there is nothing froward or perverse in them they are all plain to him that understandeth and right to them that find knowledge receive my instruction and not silver and knowledge rather than choice gold for wisdom is better than rubies and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it i wisdom dwell with prudence and find out knowledge of witty inventions the fear of the lord is to hate evil pride and arrogancy and the evil way and the froward mouth do i hate counsel is mine and sound wisdom i am understanding i have strength by me kings reign and princes decree justice by me princes rule and nobles even all the judges of the earth i love them that love me and those that seek me early shall find me riches and honour are with me yea durable riches and righteousness my fruit is better than gold yea than fine gold and my revenue than choice silver i lead in the way of righteousness in the midst of the paths of judgment that i may cause those that love me to inherit substance and i will fill their treasures the lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old i was set up from everlasting from the beginning or ever the earth was when there were no depths i was brought forth when there were no fountains abounding with water before the mountains were settled before the hills was i brought forth while as yet he had not made the earth nor the fields nor the highest part of the dust of the world when he prepared the heavens i was there when he set a compass upon the face of the depth when he established the clouds above when he strengthened the fountains of the deep when he gave to the sea his decree that the waters should not pass his commandment when he appointed the foundations of the earth then i was by him as one brought up with him and i was daily his delight rejoicing always before him rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth and my delights were with the sons of men now therefore hearken unto me o ye children for blessed are they that keep my ways hear instruction and be wise and refuse it not blessed is the man that heareth me watching daily at my gates waiting at the posts of my doors for whoso findeth me findeth life and shall obtain favour of the lord but he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul all they that hate me love death wisdom hath builded her house she hath hewn out her seven pillars she hath killed her beasts she hath mingled her wine she hath also furnished her table she hath sent forth her maidens she crieth upon the highest places of the city whoso is simple let him turn in hither as for him that wanteth understanding she saith to him come eat of my bread and drink of the wine which i have mingled forsake the foolish and live and go in the way of understanding he that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot reprove not a scorner lest he hate thee rebuke a wise man and he will love thee give instruction to a wise man and he will be yet wiser teach a just man and he will increase in learning the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the holy is understanding for by me thy days shall be multiplied and the years of thy life shall be increased if thou be wise thou shalt be wise for thyself but if thou scornest thou alone shalt bear it a foolish woman is clamorous she is simple and knoweth nothing for she sitteth at the door of her house on a seat in the high places of the city to call passengers who go right on their ways whoso is simple let him turn in hither and as for him that wanteth understanding she saith to him stolen waters are sweet and bread eaten in secret is pleasant but he knoweth not that the dead are there and that her guests are in the depths of hell the proverbs of solomon a wise son maketh a glad father but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother treasures of wickedness profit nothing but righteousness delivereth from death the lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish but he casteth away the substance of the wicked he becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand but the hand of the diligent maketh rich he that gathereth in summer is a wise son but he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame blessings are upon the head of the just but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked the memory of the just is blessed but the name of the wicked shall rot the wise in heart will receive commandments but a prating fool shall fall he that walketh uprightly walketh surely but he that perverteth his ways shall be known he that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow but a prating fool shall fall the mouth of a righteous man is a well of life but violence covereth the mouth
