women children that have not known a man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves and do ye abide without the camp seven days whosoever hath killed any person and whosoever hath touched any slain purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day and on the seventh day and purify all your raiment and all that is made of skins and all work of goats hair and all things made of wood and eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle this is the ordinance of the law which the lord commanded moses only the gold and the silver the brass the iron the tin and the lead every thing that may abide the fire ye shall make it go through the fire and it shall be clean nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water and ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day and ye shall be clean and afterward ye shall come into the camp and the lord spake unto moses saying take the sum of the prey that was taken both of man and of beast thou and eleazar the priest and the chief fathers of the congregation and divide the prey into two parts between them that took the war upon them who went out to battle and between all the congregation and levy a tribute unto the lord of the men of war which went out to battle one soul of five hundred both of the persons and of the beeves and of the asses and of the sheep take it of their half and give it unto eleazar the priest for an heave offering of the lord and of the children of israels half thou shalt take one portion of fifty of the persons of the beeves of the asses and of the flocks of all manner of beasts and give them unto the levites which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the lord and moses and eleazar the priest did as the lord commanded moses and the booty being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep and threescore and twelve thousand beeves and threescore and one thousand asses and thirty and two thousand persons in all of women that had not known man by lying with him and the half which was the portion of them that went out to war was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep and the lords tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen and the beeves were thirty and six thousand of which the lords tribute was threescore and twelve and the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred of which the lords tribute was threescore and one and the persons were sixteen thousand of which the lords tribute was thirty and two persons and moses gave the tribute which was the lords heave offering unto eleazar the priest as the lord commanded moses and of the children of israels half which moses divided from the men that warred now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep and thirty and six thousand beeves and thirty thousand asses and five hundred and sixteen thousand persons even of the children of israels half moses took one portion of fifty both of man and of beast and gave them unto the levites which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the lord as the lord commanded moses and the officers which were over thousands of the host the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds came near unto moses and they said unto moses thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge and there lacketh not one man of us we have therefore brought an oblation for the lord what every man hath gotten of jewels of gold chains and bracelets rings earrings and tablets to make an atonement for our souls before the lord and
