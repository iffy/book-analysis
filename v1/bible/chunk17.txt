my son and he said unto him behold here am i and he said behold now i am old i know not the day of my death now therefore take i pray thee thy weapons thy quiver and thy bow and go out to the field and take me some venison and make me savoury meat such as i love and bring it to me that i may eat that my soul may bless thee before i die and rebekah heard when isaac spake to esau his son and esau went to the field to hunt for venison and to bring it and rebekah spake unto jacob her son saying behold i heard thy father speak unto esau thy brother saying bring me venison and make me savoury meat that i may eat and bless thee before the lord before my death now therefore my son obey my voice according to that which i command thee go now to the flock and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats and i will make them savoury meat for thy father such as he loveth and thou shalt bring it to thy father that he may eat and that he may bless thee before his death and jacob said to rebekah his mother behold esau my brother is a hairy man and i am a smooth man my father peradventure will feel me and i shall seem to him as a deceiver and i shall bring a curse upon me and not a blessing and his mother said unto him upon me be thy curse my son only obey my voice and go fetch me them and he went and fetched and brought them to his mother and his mother made savoury meat such as his father loved and rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son esau which were with her in the house and put them upon jacob her younger son and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands and upon the smooth of his neck and she gave the savoury meat and the bread which she had prepared into the hand of her son jacob and he came unto his father and said my father and he said here am i who art thou my son and jacob said unto his father i am esau thy first born i have done according as thou badest me arise i pray thee sit and eat of my venison that thy soul may bless me and isaac said unto his son how is it that thou hast found it so quickly my son and he said because the lord thy god brought it to me and isaac said unto jacob come near i pray thee that i may feel thee my son whether thou be my very son esau or not and jacob went near unto isaac his father and he felt him and said the voice is jacobs voice but the hands are the hands of esau and he discerned him not because his hands were hairy as his brother esaus hands so he blessed him and he said art thou my very son esau and he said i am and he said bring it near to me and i will eat of my sons venison that my soul may bless thee and he brought it near to him and he did eat and he brought him wine and he drank and his father isaac said unto him come near now and kiss me my son and he came near and kissed him and he smelled the smell of his raiment and blessed him and said see the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the lord hath blessed therefore god give thee of the dew of heaven and the fatness of the earth and plenty of corn and wine let people serve thee and nations bow down to thee be lord over thy brethren and let thy mothers sons bow down to thee cursed be every one that curseth thee and blessed be he that blesseth thee and it came to pass as soon as isaac had made an end of blessing jacob and jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of isaac his father that esau his brother came in from his hunting and he also had made savoury meat and brought it unto his father and said unto his father let my father arise and eat of his sons venison that thy soul may bless me and isaac his father said unto him who art thou and he said i am thy son thy firstborn esau and isaac trembled very exceedingly and said who where is he that hath taken venison and brought it me and i have eaten of all before thou camest and have blessed him yea and he shall be blessed and when esau heard the words of his father he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry and said unto his father bless me even me also o my father and he said thy brother came with subtilty and hath taken away thy blessing and he said is not he rightly named jacob for he hath supplanted me these two times he took away my birthright and behold now he hath taken away my blessing and he said hast thou not reserved a blessing for me and isaac answered and said unto esau behold i have made him thy lord and all his brethren have i given to him for servants and with corn and wine have i sustained him and what shall i do now unto thee my son and esau said unto his father hast thou but one blessing my father bless me even me also o my father and esau lifted up his voice and wept and isaac his father answered and said unto him behold thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth and of the dew of heaven from above and by thy sword shalt thou live and shalt serve thy brother and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck and esau hated jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him and esau said in his heart the days of mourning for my father
