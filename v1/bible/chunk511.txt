saith the lord god thou shalt drink of thy sisters cup deep and large thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision it containeth much thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow with the cup of astonishment and desolation with the cup of thy sister samaria thou shalt even drink it and suck it out and thou shalt break the sherds thereof and pluck off thine own breasts for i have spoken it saith the lord god therefore thus saith the lord god because thou hast forgotten me and cast me behind thy back therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms the lord said moreover unto me son of man wilt thou judge aholah and aholibah yea declare unto them their abominations that they have committed adultery and blood is in their hands and with their idols have they committed adultery and have also caused their sons whom they bare unto me to pass for them through the fire to devour them moreover this they have done unto me they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day and have profaned my sabbaths for when they had slain their children to their idols then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it and lo thus have they done in the midst of mine house and furthermore that ye have sent for men to come from far unto whom a messenger was sent and lo they came for whom thou didst wash thyself paintedst thy eyes and deckedst thyself with ornaments and satest upon a stately bed and a table prepared before it whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil and a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her and with the men of the common sort were brought sabeans from the wilderness which put bracelets upon their hands and beautiful crowns upon their heads then said i unto her that was old in adulteries will they now commit whoredoms with her and she with them yet they went in unto her as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot so went they in unto aholah and unto aholibah the lewd women and the righteous men they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses and after the manner of women that shed blood because they are adulteresses and blood is in their hands for thus saith the lord god i will bring up a company upon them and will give them to be removed and spoiled and the company shall stone them with stones and dispatch them with their swords they shall slay their sons and their daughters and burn up their houses with fire thus will i cause lewdness to cease out of the land that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness and they shall recompense your lewdness upon you and ye shall bear the sins of your idols and ye shall know that i am the lord god again in the ninth year in the tenth month in the tenth day of the month the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man write thee the name of the day even of this same day the king of babylon set himself against jerusalem this same day and utter a parable unto the rebellious house and say unto them thus saith the lord god set on a pot set it on and also pour water into it gather the pieces thereof into it even every good piece the thigh and the shoulder fill it with the choice bones take the choice of the flock and burn also the bones under it and make it boil well and let them seethe the bones of it therein wherefore thus saith the lord god woe to the bloody city to the pot whose scum is therein and whose scum is not gone out of it bring it out piece by piece let no lot fall upon it for her blood is in the midst of her she set it upon the top of a rock she poured it not upon the ground to cover it with dust that it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance i have set her blood upon the top of a rock that it should not be covered therefore thus saith the lord god woe to the bloody city i will even make the pile for fire great heap on wood kindle the fire consume the flesh and spice it well and let the bones be burned then set it empty upon the coals thereof that the brass of it may be hot and may burn and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it that the scum of it may be consumed she hath wearied herself with lies and her great scum went not forth out of her her scum shall be in the fire in thy filthiness is lewdness because i have purged thee and thou wast not purged thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more till i have caused my fury to rest upon thee i the lord have spoken it it shall come to pass and i will do it i will not go back neither will i spare neither will i repent according to thy ways and according to thy doings shall they judge thee saith the lord god also the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man behold i take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep neither shall thy tears run down forbear to cry make no mourning for the dead bind the tire of thine head upon thee and put on thy shoes upon thy feet and cover not thy lips and eat not the bread of men so i spake unto the people in the morning and at even my wife died and i did in the morning as i was commanded and the people said unto me wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us that thou doest so then i answered them the word of the lord came unto me saying speak unto the house of israel thus saith the lord god behold i will profane my sanctuary the excellency of your strength the desire
