his holy habitation god setteth the solitary in families he bringeth out those which are bound with chains but the rebellious dwell in a dry land o god when thou wentest forth before thy people when thou didst march through the wilderness selah the earth shook the heavens also dropped at the presence of god even sinai itself was moved at the presence of god the god of israel thou o god didst send a plentiful rain whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance when it was weary thy congregation hath dwelt therein thou o god hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor the lord gave the word great was the company of those that published it kings of armies did flee apace and she that tarried at home divided the spoil though ye have lien among the pots yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver and her feathers with yellow gold when the almighty scattered kings in it it was white as snow in salmon the hill of god is as the hill of bashan an high hill as the hill of bashan why leap ye ye high hills this is the hill which god desireth to dwell in yea the lord will dwell in it for ever the chariots of god are twenty thousand even thousands of angels the lord is among them as in sinai in the holy place thou hast ascended on high thou hast led captivity captive thou hast received gifts for men yea for the rebellious also that the lord god might dwell among them blessed be the lord who daily loadeth us with benefits even the god of our salvation selah he that is our god is the god of salvation and unto god the lord belong the issues from death but god shall wound the head of his enemies and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses the lord said i will bring again from bashan i will bring my people again from the depths of the sea that thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies and the tongue of thy dogs in the same they have seen thy goings o god even the goings of my god my king in the sanctuary the singers went before the players on instruments followed after among them were the damsels playing with timbrels bless ye god in the congregations even the lord from the fountain of israel there is little benjamin with their ruler the princes of judah and their council the princes of zebulun and the princes of naphtali thy god hath commanded thy strength strengthen o god that which thou hast wrought for us because of thy temple at jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee rebuke the company of spearmen the multitude of the bulls with the calves of the people till every one submit himself with pieces of silver scatter thou the people that delight in war princes shall come out of egypt ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto god sing unto god ye kingdoms of the earth o sing praises unto the lord selah to him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens which were of old lo he doth send out his voice and that a mighty voice ascribe ye strength unto god his excellency is over israel and his strength is in the clouds o god thou art terrible out of thy holy places the god of israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people blessed be god save me o god for the waters are come in unto my soul i sink in deep mire where there is no standing i am come into deep waters where the floods overflow me i am weary of my crying my throat is dried mine eyes fail while i wait for my god they that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head they that would destroy me being mine enemies wrongfully are mighty then i restored that which i took not away o god thou knowest my foolishness and my sins are not hid from thee let not them that wait on thee o lord god of hosts be ashamed for my sake let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake o god of israel because for thy sake i have borne reproach shame hath covered my face i am become a stranger unto my brethren and an alien unto my mothers children for the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me when i wept and chastened my soul with fasting that was to my reproach i made sackcloth also my garment and i became a proverb to them they that sit in the gate speak against me and i was the song of the drunkards but as for me my prayer is unto thee o lord in an acceptable time o god in the multitude of thy mercy hear me in the truth of thy salvation deliver me out of the mire and let me not sink let me be delivered from them that hate me and out of the deep waters let not the waterflood overflow me neither let the deep swallow me up and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me hear me o lord for thy lovingkindness is good turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies and hide not thy face from thy servant for i am in trouble hear me speedily draw nigh unto my soul and redeem it deliver me because of mine enemies thou hast known my reproach and my shame and my dishonour mine adversaries are all before thee reproach hath broken my heart and i am full of heaviness and i looked for some to take pity but there was none and for comforters but i found none they gave me also gall for my meat and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink let their table become a snare before them and that which should have been for their welfare let it become a trap let their eyes be darkened that they see not and make their loins continually to shake pour out thine indignation
