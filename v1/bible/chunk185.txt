the priests of the lord were there and when the time was that elkanah offered he gave to peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters portions but unto hannah he gave a worthy portion for he loved hannah but the lord had shut up her womb and her adversary also provoked her sore for to make her fret because the lord had shut up her womb and as he did so year by year when she went up to the house of the lord so she provoked her therefore she wept and did not eat then said elkanah her husband to her hannah why weepest thou and why eatest thou not and why is thy heart grieved am not i better to thee than ten sons so hannah rose up after they had eaten in shiloh and after they had drunk now eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the lord and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the lord and wept sore and she vowed a vow and said o lord of hosts if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid and remember me and not forget thine handmaid but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child then i will give him unto the lord all the days of his life and there shall no razor come upon his head and it came to pass as she continued praying before the lord that eli marked her mouth now hannah she spake in her heart only her lips moved but her voice was not heard therefore eli thought she had been drunken and eli said unto her how long wilt thou be drunken put away thy wine from thee and hannah answered and said no my lord i am a woman of a sorrowful spirit i have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but have poured out my soul before the lord count not thine handmaid for a daughter of belial for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have i spoken hitherto then eli answered and said go in peace and the god of israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him and she said let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight so the woman went her way and did eat and her countenance was no more sad and they rose up in the morning early and worshipped before the lord and returned and came to their house to ramah and elkanah knew hannah his wife and the lord remembered her wherefore it came to pass when the time was come about after hannah had conceived that she bare a son and called his name samuel saying because i have asked him of the lord and the man elkanah and all his house went up to offer unto the lord the yearly sacrifice and his vow but hannah went not up for she said unto her husband i will not go up until the child be weaned and then i will bring him that he may appear before the lord and there abide for ever and elkanah her husband said unto her do what seemeth thee good tarry until thou have weaned him only the lord establish his word so the woman abode and gave her son suck until she weaned him and when she had weaned him she took him up with her with three bullocks and one ephah of flour and a bottle of wine and brought him unto the house of the lord in shiloh and the child was young and they slew a bullock and brought the child to eli and she said oh my lord as thy soul liveth my lord i am the woman that stood by thee here praying unto the lord for this child i prayed and the lord hath given me my petition which i asked of him therefore also i have lent him to the lord as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the lord and he worshipped the lord there and hannah prayed and said my heart rejoiceth in the lord mine horn is exalted in the lord my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies because i rejoice in thy salvation there is none holy as the lord for there is none beside thee neither is there any rock like our god talk no more so exceeding proudly let not arrogancy come out of your mouth for the lord is a god of knowledge and by him actions are weighed the bows of the mighty men are broken and they that stumbled are girded with strength they that were full have hired out themselves for bread and they that were hungry ceased so that the barren hath born seven and she that hath many children is waxed feeble the lord killeth and maketh alive he bringeth down to the grave and bringeth up the lord maketh poor and maketh rich he bringeth low and lifteth up he raiseth up the poor out of the dust and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill to set them among princes and to make them inherit the throne of glory for the pillars of the earth are the lords and he hath set the world upon them he will keep the feet of his saints and the wicked shall be silent in darkness for by strength shall no man prevail the adversaries of the lord shall be broken to pieces out of heaven shall he thunder upon them the lord shall judge the ends of the earth and he shall give strength unto his king and exalt the horn of his anointed and elkanah went to ramah to his house and the child did minister unto the lord before eli the priest now the sons of eli were sons of belial they knew not the lord and the priests custom with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice the priests servant came while the flesh was in seething with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand and he struck it into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself so they did in shiloh unto all the israelites that came thither also before they burnt the fat the
