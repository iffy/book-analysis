for food for your little ones and they said thou hast saved our lives let us find grace in the sight of my lord and we will be pharaohs servants and joseph made it a law over the land of egypt unto this day that pharaoh should have the fifth part except the land of the priests only which became not pharaohs and israel dwelt in the land of egypt in the country of goshen and they had possessions therein and grew and multiplied exceedingly and jacob lived in the land of egypt seventeen years so the whole age of jacob was an hundred forty and seven years and the time drew nigh that israel must die and he called his son joseph and said unto him if now i have found grace in thy sight put i pray thee thy hand under my thigh and deal kindly and truly with me bury me not i pray thee in egypt but i will lie with my fathers and thou shalt carry me out of egypt and bury me in their buryingplace and he said i will do as thou hast said and he said swear unto me and he sware unto him and israel bowed himself upon the beds head and it came to pass after these things that one told joseph behold thy father is sick and he took with him his two sons manasseh and ephraim and one told jacob and said behold thy son joseph cometh unto thee and israel strengthened himself and sat upon the bed and jacob said unto joseph god almighty appeared unto me at luz in the land of canaan and blessed me and said unto me behold i will make thee fruitful and multiply thee and i will make of thee a multitude of people and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession and now thy two sons ephraim and manasseh which were born unto thee in the land of egypt before i came unto thee into egypt are mine as reuben and simeon they shall be mine and thy issue which thou begettest after them shall be thine and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance and as for me when i came from padan rachel died by me in the land of canaan in the way when yet there was but a little way to come unto ephrath and i buried her there in the way of ephrath the same is bethlehem and israel beheld josephs sons and said who are these and joseph said unto his father they are my sons whom god hath given me in this place and he said bring them i pray thee unto me and i will bless them now the eyes of israel were dim for age so that he could not see and he brought them near unto him and he kissed them and embraced them and israel said unto joseph i had not thought to see thy face and lo god hath shewed me also thy seed and joseph brought them out from between his knees and he bowed himself with his face to the earth and joseph took them both ephraim in his right hand toward israels left hand and manasseh in his left hand toward israels right hand and brought them near unto him and israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon ephraims head who was the younger and his left hand upon manassehs head guiding his hands wittingly for manasseh was the firstborn and he blessed joseph and said god before whom my fathers abraham and isaac did walk the god which fed me all my life long unto this day the angel which redeemed me from all evil bless the lads and let my name be named on them and the name of my fathers abraham and isaac and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth and when joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of ephraim it displeased him and he held up his fathers hand to remove it from ephraims head unto manassehs head and joseph said unto his father not so my father for this is the firstborn put thy right hand upon his head and his father refused and said i know it my son i know it he also shall become a people and he also shall be great but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he and his seed shall become a multitude of nations and he blessed them that day saying in thee shall israel bless saying god make thee as ephraim and as manasseh and he set ephraim before manasseh and israel said unto joseph behold i die but god shall be with you and bring you again unto the land of your fathers moreover i have given to thee one portion above thy brethren which i took out of the hand of the amorite with my sword and with my bow and jacob called unto his sons and said gather yourselves together that i may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days gather yourselves together and hear ye sons of jacob and hearken unto israel your father reuben thou art my firstborn my might and the beginning of my strength the excellency of dignity and the excellency of power unstable as water thou shalt not excel because thou wentest up to thy fathers bed then defiledst thou it he went up to my couch simeon and levi are brethren instruments of cruelty are in their habitations o my soul come not thou into their secret unto their assembly mine honour be not thou united for in their anger they slew a man and in their selfwill they digged down a wall cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for it was cruel i will divide them in jacob and scatter them in israel judah thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies thy fathers children shall bow down before thee judah is a lions whelp from the prey my son thou art gone up he stooped down he couched as a lion and as an old lion who shall rouse him up the
