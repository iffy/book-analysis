meshullemeth the daughter of haruz of jotbah and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord as his father manasseh did and he walked in all the way that his father walked in and served the idols that his father served and worshipped them and he forsook the lord god of his fathers and walked not in the way of the lord and the servants of amon conspired against him and slew the king in his own house and the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king amon and the people of the land made josiah his son king in his stead now the rest of the acts of amon which he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah and he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of uzza and josiah his son reigned in his stead josiah was eight years old when he began to reign and he reigned thirty and one years in jerusalem and his mothers name was jedidah the daughter of adaiah of boscath and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord and walked in all the way of david his father and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left and it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king josiah that the king sent shaphan the son of azaliah the son of meshullam the scribe to the house of the lord saying go up to hilkiah the high priest that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the lord which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people and let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work that have the oversight of the house of the lord and let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the lord to repair the breaches of the house unto carpenters and builders and masons and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand because they dealt faithfully and hilkiah the high priest said unto shaphan the scribe i have found the book of the law in the house of the lord and hilkiah gave the book to shaphan and he read it and shaphan the scribe came to the king and brought the king word again and said thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the house and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work that have the oversight of the house of the lord and shaphan the scribe shewed the king saying hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book and shaphan read it before the king and it came to pass when the king had heard the words of the book of the law that he rent his clothes and the king commanded hilkiah the priest and ahikam the son of shaphan and achbor the son of michaiah and shaphan the scribe and asahiah a servant of the kings saying go ye enquire of the lord for me and for the people and for all judah concerning the words of this book that is found for great is the wrath of the lord that is kindled against us because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book to do according unto all that which is written concerning us so hilkiah the priest and ahikam and achbor and shaphan and asahiah went unto huldah the prophetess the wife of shallum the son of tikvah the son of harhas keeper of the wardrobe now she dwelt in jerusalem in the college and they communed with her and she said unto them thus saith the lord god of israel tell the man that sent you to me thus saith the lord behold i will bring evil upon this place and upon the inhabitants thereof even all the words of the book which the king of judah hath read because they have forsaken me and have burned incense unto other gods that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place and shall not be quenched but to the king of judah which sent you to enquire of the lord thus shall ye say to him thus saith the lord god of israel as touching the words which thou hast heard because thine heart was tender and thou hast humbled thyself before the lord when thou heardest what i spake against this place and against the inhabitants thereof that they should become a desolation and a curse and hast rent thy clothes and wept before me i also have heard thee saith the lord behold therefore i will gather thee unto thy fathers and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which i will bring upon this place and they brought the king word again and the king sent and they gathered unto him all the elders of judah and of jerusalem and the king went up into the house of the lord and all the men of judah and all the inhabitants of jerusalem with him and the priests and the prophets and all the people both small and great and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the lord and the king stood by a pillar and made a covenant before the lord to walk after the lord and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book and all the people stood to the covenant and the king commanded hilkiah the high priest and the priests of the second order and the keepers of the door to bring forth out of the temple of the lord all the vessels that were made for baal and for the grove and for all the host of heaven and he burned them without jerusalem in the fields of
