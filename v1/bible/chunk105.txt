they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation and behold the cloud covered it and the glory of the lord appeared and moses and aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation and the lord spake unto moses saying get you up from among this congregation that i may consume them as in a moment and they fell upon their faces and moses said unto aaron take a censer and put fire therein from off the altar and put on incense and go quickly unto the congregation and make an atonement for them for there is wrath gone out from the lord the plague is begun and aaron took as moses commanded and ran into the midst of the congregation and behold the plague was begun among the people and he put on incense and made an atonement for the people and he stood between the dead and the living and the plague was stayed now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred beside them that died about the matter of korah and aaron returned unto moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and the plague was stayed and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods write thou every mans name upon his rod and thou shalt write aarons name upon the rod of levi for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers and thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony where i will meet with you and it shall come to pass that the mans rod whom i shall choose shall blossom and i will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of israel whereby they murmur against you and moses spake unto the children of israel and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece for each prince one according to their fathers houses even twelve rods and the rod of aaron was among their rods and moses laid up the rods before the lord in the tabernacle of witness and it came to pass that on the morrow moses went into the tabernacle of witness and behold the rod of aaron for the house of levi was budded and brought forth buds and bloomed blossoms and yielded almonds and moses brought out all the rods from before the lord unto all the children of israel and they looked and took every man his rod and the lord said unto moses bring aarons rod again before the testimony to be kept for a token against the rebels and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me that they die not and moses did so as the lord commanded him so did he and the children of israel spake unto moses saying behold we die we perish we all perish whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the lord shall die shall we be consumed with dying and the lord said unto aaron thou and thy sons and thy fathers house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood and thy brethren also of the tribe of levi the tribe of thy father bring thou with thee that they may be joined unto thee and minister unto thee but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness and they shall keep thy charge and the charge of all the tabernacle only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar that neither they nor ye also die and they shall be joined unto thee and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation for all the service of the tabernacle and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you and ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary and the charge of the altar that there be no wrath any more upon the children of israel and i behold i have taken your brethren the levites from among the children of israel to you they are given as a gift for the lord to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priests office for everything of the altar and within the vail and ye shall serve i have given your priests office unto you as a service of gift and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death and the lord spake unto aaron behold i also have given thee the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of israel unto thee have i given them by reason of the anointing and to thy sons by an ordinance for ever this shall be thine of the most holy things reserved from the fire every oblation of theirs every meat offering of theirs and every sin offering of theirs and every trespass offering of theirs which they shall render unto me shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons in the most holy place shalt thou eat it every male shall eat it it shall be holy unto thee and this is thine the heave offering of their gift with all the wave offerings of the children of israel i have given them unto thee and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee by a statute for ever every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it all the best of the oil and all the best of the wine and of the wheat the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the lord them have i given thee and whatsoever is first ripe in the land which they shall bring unto the lord shall be thine every one that is clean in thine house shall eat of it every thing devoted in israel shall be thine every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh which they bring unto the lord whether it be of men or beasts shall be thine nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem and
