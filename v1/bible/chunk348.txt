cloud is not rent under them he holdeth back the face of his throne and spreadeth his cloud upon it he hath compassed the waters with bounds until the day and night come to an end the pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof he divideth the sea with his power and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud by his spirit he hath garnished the heavens his hand hath formed the crooked serpent lo these are parts of his ways but how little a portion is heard of him but the thunder of his power who can understand moreover job continued his parable and said as god liveth who hath taken away my judgment and the almighty who hath vexed my soul all the while my breath is in me and the spirit of god is in my nostrils my lips shall not speak wickedness nor my tongue utter deceit god forbid that i should justify you till i die i will not remove mine integrity from me my righteousness i hold fast and will not let it go my heart shall not reproach me so long as i live let mine enemy be as the wicked and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous for what is the hope of the hypocrite though he hath gained when god taketh away his soul will god hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him will he delight himself in the almighty will he always call upon god i will teach you by the hand of god that which is with the almighty will i not conceal behold all ye yourselves have seen it why then are ye thus altogether vain this is the portion of a wicked man with god and the heritage of oppressors which they shall receive of the almighty if his children be multiplied it is for the sword and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread those that remain of him shall be buried in death and his widows shall not weep though he heap up silver as the dust and prepare raiment as the clay he may prepare it but the just shall put it on and the innocent shall divide the silver he buildeth his house as a moth and as a booth that the keeper maketh the rich man shall lie down but he shall not be gathered he openeth his eyes and he is not terrors take hold on him as waters a tempest stealeth him away in the night the east wind carrieth him away and he departeth and as a storm hurleth him out of his place for god shall cast upon him and not spare he would fain flee out of his hand men shall clap their hands at him and shall hiss him out of his place surely there is a vein for the silver and a place for gold where they fine it iron is taken out of the earth and brass is molten out of the stone he setteth an end to darkness and searcheth out all perfection the stones of darkness and the shadow of death the flood breaketh out from the inhabitant even the waters forgotten of the foot they are dried up they are gone away from men as for the earth out of it cometh bread and under it is turned up as it were fire the stones of it are the place of sapphires and it hath dust of gold there is a path which no fowl knoweth and which the vultures eye hath not seen the lions whelps have not trodden it nor the fierce lion passed by it he putteth forth his hand upon the rock he overturneth the mountains by the roots he cutteth out rivers among the rocks and his eye seeth every precious thing he bindeth the floods from overflowing and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light but where shall wisdom be found and where is the place of understanding man knoweth not the price thereof neither is it found in the land of the living the depth saith it is not in me and the sea saith it is not with me it cannot be gotten for gold neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof it cannot be valued with the gold of ophir with the precious onyx or the sapphire the gold and the crystal cannot equal it and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold no mention shall be made of coral or of pearls for the price of wisdom is above rubies the topaz of ethiopia shall not equal it neither shall it be valued with pure gold whence then cometh wisdom and where is the place of understanding seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living and kept close from the fowls of the air destruction and death say we have heard the fame thereof with our ears god understandeth the way thereof and he knoweth the place thereof for he looketh to the ends of the earth and seeth under the whole heaven to make the weight for the winds and

when my children were about me when i washed my steps with butter and the rock poured me out rivers of oil when i went out to the gate through the city when i prepared my seat in the street the young
