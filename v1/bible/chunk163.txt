of the lord our god that is before his tabernacle and when phinehas the priest and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of israel which were with him heard the words that the children of reuben and the children of gad and the children of manasseh spake it pleased them and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest said unto the children of reuben and to the children of gad and to the children of manasseh this day we perceive that the lord is among us because ye have not committed this trespass against the lord now ye have delivered the children of israel out of the hand of the lord and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest and the princes returned from the children of reuben and from the children of gad out of the land of gilead unto the land of canaan to the children of israel and brought them word again and the thing pleased the children of israel and the children of israel blessed god and did not intend to go up against them in battle to destroy the land wherein the children of reuben and gad dwelt and the children of reuben and the children of gad called the altar ed for it shall be a witness between us that the lord is god and it came to pass a long time after that the lord had given rest unto israel from all their enemies round about that joshua waxed old and stricken in age and joshua called for all israel and for their elders and for their heads and for their judges and for their officers and said unto them i am old and stricken in age and ye have seen all that the lord your god hath done unto all these nations because of you for the lord your god is he that hath fought for you behold i have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain to be an inheritance for your tribes from jordan with all the nations that i have cut off even unto the great sea westward and the lord your god he shall expel them from before you and drive them from out of your sight and ye shall possess their land as the lord your god hath promised unto you be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of moses that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left that ye come not among these nations these that remain among you neither make mention of the name of their gods nor cause to swear by them neither serve them nor bow yourselves unto them but cleave unto the lord your god as ye have done unto this day for the lord hath driven out from before you great nations and strong but as for you no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day one man of you shall chase a thousand for the lord your god he it is that fighteth for you as he hath promised you take good heed therefore unto yourselves that ye love the lord your god else if ye do in any wise go back and cleave unto the remnant of these nations even these that remain among you and shall make marriages with them and go in unto them and they to you know for a certainty that the lord your god will no more drive out any of these nations from before you but they shall be snares and traps unto you and scourges in your sides and thorns in your eyes until ye perish from off this good land which the lord your god hath given you and behold this day i am going the way of all the earth and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the lord your god spake concerning you all are come to pass unto you and not one thing hath failed thereof therefore it shall come to pass that as all good things are come upon you which the lord your god promised you so shall the lord bring upon you all evil things until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the lord your god hath given you when ye have transgressed the covenant of the lord your god which he commanded you and have gone and served other gods and bowed yourselves to them then shall the anger of the lord be kindled against you and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you and joshua gathered all the tribes of israel to shechem and called for the elders of israel and for their heads and for their judges and for their officers and they presented themselves before god and joshua said unto all the people thus saith the lord god of israel your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time even terah the father of abraham and the father of nachor and they served other gods and i took your father abraham from the other side of the flood and led him throughout all the land of canaan and multiplied his seed and gave him isaac and i gave unto isaac jacob and esau and i gave unto esau mount seir to possess it but jacob and his children went down into egypt i sent moses also and aaron and i plagued egypt according to that which i did among them and afterward i brought you out and i brought your fathers out of egypt and ye came unto the sea and the egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the red sea and when they cried unto the lord he put darkness between you and the egyptians and brought the sea upon them and covered them and your eyes have seen what i have done in egypt and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season and i brought you into the land of the amorites which dwelt on the other side jordan and they fought with you and i gave them into your hand that ye might possess their land and i destroyed
