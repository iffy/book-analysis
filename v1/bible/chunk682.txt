christ i have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto ye were not able to bear it neither yet now are ye able for ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions are ye not carnal and walk as men for while one saith i am of paul and another i am of apollos are ye not carnal who then is paul and who is apollos but ministers by whom ye believed even as the lord gave to every man i have planted apollos watered but god gave the increase so then neither is he that planteth any thing neither he that watereth but god that giveth the increase now he that planteth and he that watereth are one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour for we are labourers together with god ye are gods husbandry ye are gods building according to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wise masterbuilder i have laid the foundation and another buildeth thereon but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon for other foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is jesus christ now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble every mans work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every mans work of what sort it is if any mans work abide which he hath built thereupon he shall receive a reward if any mans work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire know ye not that ye are the temple of god and that the spirit of god dwelleth in you if any man defile the temple of god him shall god destroy for the temple of god is holy which temple ye are let no man deceive himself if any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world let him become a fool that he may be wise for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god for it is written he taketh the wise in their own craftiness and again the lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise that they are vain therefore let no man glory in men for all things are yours whether paul or apollos or cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come all are yours and ye are christs and christ is gods let a man so account of us as of the ministers of christ and stewards of the mysteries of god moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful but with me it is a very small thing that i should be judged of you or of mans judgment yea i judge not mine own self for i know nothing by myself yet am i not hereby justified but he that judgeth me is the lord therefore judge nothing before the time until the lord come who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts and then shall every man have praise of god and these things brethren i have in a figure transferred to myself and to apollos for your sakes that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written that no one of you be puffed up for one against another for who maketh thee to differ from another and what hast thou that thou didst not receive now if thou didst receive it why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it now ye are full now ye are rich ye have reigned as kings without us and i would to god ye did reign that we also might reign with you for i think that god hath set forth us the apostles last as it were appointed to death for we are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men we are fools for christs sake but ye are wise in christ we are weak but ye are strong ye are honourable but we are despised even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no certain dwellingplace and labour working with our own hands being reviled we bless being persecuted we suffer it being defamed we intreat we are made as the filth of the world and are the offscouring of all things unto this day i write not these things to shame you but as my beloved sons i warn you for though ye have ten thousand instructers in christ yet have ye not many fathers for in christ jesus i have begotten you through the gospel wherefore i beseech you be ye followers of me for this cause have i sent unto you timotheus who is my beloved son and faithful in the lord who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in christ as i teach every where in every church now some are puffed up as though i would not come to you but i will come to you shortly if the lord will and will know not the speech of them which are puffed up but the power for the kingdom of god is not in word but in power what will ye shall i come unto you with a rod or in love and in the spirit of meekness it is reported commonly that there is fornication among you and such fornication as is not so much as named among the gentiles that one should have his fathers wife and ye are puffed up and have not rather mourned that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you for i verily as absent in body but present in spirit have judged already as though i were present concerning him that hath so done this deed in the name of our lord jesus christ when ye are gathered together and my spirit with the power of our lord jesus christ to deliver such an one unto satan for the destruction of the flesh that the
