esther for hatach one of the kings chamberlains whom he had appointed to attend upon her and gave him a commandment to mordecai to know what it was and why it was so hatach went forth to mordecai unto the street of the city which was before the kings gate and mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him and of the sum of the money that haman had promised to pay to the kings treasuries for the jews to destroy them also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at shushan to destroy them to shew it unto esther and to declare it unto her and to charge her that she should go in unto the king to make supplication unto him and to make request before him for her people and hatach came and told esther the words of mordecai again esther spake unto hatach and gave him commandment unto mordecai all the kings servants and the people of the kings provinces do know that whosoever whether man or women shall come unto the king into the inner court who is not called there is one law of his to put him to death except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre that he may live but i have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days and they told to mordecai esthers words then mordecai commanded to answer esther think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the kings house more than all the jews for if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the jews from another place but thou and thy fathers house shall be destroyed and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this then esther bade them return mordecai this answer go gather together all the jews that are present in shushan and fast ye for me and neither eat nor drink three days night or day i also and my maidens will fast likewise and so will i go in unto the king which is not according to the law and if i perish i perish so mordecai went his way and did according to all that esther had commanded him now it came to pass on the third day that esther put on her royal apparel and stood in the inner court of the kings house over against the kings house and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house over against the gate of the house and it was so when the king saw esther the queen standing in the court that she obtained favour in his sight and the king held out to esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand so esther drew near and touched the top of the sceptre then said the king unto her what wilt thou queen esther and what is thy request it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom and esther answered if it seem good unto the king let the king and haman come this day unto the banquet that i have prepared for him then the king said cause haman to make haste that he may do as esther hath said so the king and haman came to the banquet that esther had prepared and the king said unto esther at the banquet of wine what is thy petition and it shall be granted thee and what is thy request even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed then answered esther and said my petition and my request is if i have found favour in the sight of the king and if it please the king to grant my petition and to perform my request let the king and haman come to the banquet that i shall prepare for them and i will do to morrow as the king hath said then went haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart but when haman saw mordecai in the kings gate that he stood not up nor moved for him he was full of indignation against mordecai
