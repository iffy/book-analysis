tribe of manasseh all the region of argob with all bashan which was called the land of giants jair the son of manasseh took all the country of argob unto the coasts of geshuri and maachathi and called them after his own name bashanhavothjair unto this day and i gave gilead unto machir and unto the reubenites and unto the gadites i gave from gilead even unto the river arnon half the valley and the border even unto the river jabbok which is the border of the children of ammon the plain also and jordan and the coast thereof from chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain even the salt sea under ashdothpisgah eastward and i commanded you at that time saying the lord your god hath given you this land to possess it ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of israel all that are meet for the war but your wives and your little ones and your cattle for i know that ye have much cattle shall abide in your cities which i have given you until the lord have given rest unto your brethren as well as unto you and until they also possess the land which the lord your god hath given them beyond jordan and then shall ye return every man unto his possession which i have given you and i commanded joshua at that time saying thine eyes have seen all that the lord your god hath done unto these two kings so shall the lord do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest ye shall not fear them for the lord your god he shall fight for you and i besought the lord at that time saying o lord god thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness and thy mighty hand for what god is there in heaven or in earth that can do according to thy works and according to thy might i pray thee let me go over and see the good land that is beyond jordan that goodly mountain and lebanon but the lord was wroth with me for your sakes and would not hear me and the lord said unto me let it suffice thee speak no more unto me of this matter get thee up into the top of pisgah and lift up thine eyes westward and northward and southward and eastward and behold it with thine eyes for thou shalt not go over this jordan but charge joshua and encourage him and strengthen him for he shall go over before this people and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see so we abode in the valley over against bethpeor now therefore hearken o israel unto the statutes and unto the judgments which i teach you for to do them that ye may live and go in and possess the land which the lord god of your fathers giveth you ye shall not add unto the word which i command you neither shall ye diminish ought from it that ye may keep the commandments of the lord your god which i command you your eyes have seen what the lord did because of baalpeor for all the men that followed baalpeor the lord thy god hath destroyed them from among you but ye that did cleave unto the lord your god are alive every one of you this day behold i have taught you statutes and judgments even as the lord my god commanded me that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it keep therefore and do them for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations which shall hear all these statutes and say surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people for what nation is there so great who hath god so nigh unto them as the lord our god is in all things that we call upon him for and what nation is there so great that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law which i set before you this day only take heed to thyself and keep thy soul diligently lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life but teach them thy sons and thy sons sons specially the day that thou stoodest before the lord thy god in horeb when the lord said unto me gather me the people together and i will make them hear my words that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth and that they may teach their children and ye came near and stood under the mountain and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven with darkness clouds and thick darkness and the lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire ye heard the voice of the words but saw no similitude only ye heard a voice and he declared unto you his covenant which he commanded you to perform even ten commandments and he wrote them upon two tables of stone and the lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the lord spake unto you in horeb out of the midst of the fire lest ye corrupt yourselves and make you a graven image the similitude of any figure the likeness of male or female the likeness of any beast that is on the earth the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air the likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth and lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven and when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars even all the host of heaven shouldest be driven to worship them and serve them which the lord thy god hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven but the lord hath taken you and brought you forth out of the iron furnace even out of egypt to be
