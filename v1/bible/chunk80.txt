them this is the thing which the lord hath commanded saying what man soever there be of the house of israel that killeth an ox or lamb or goat in the camp or that killeth it out of the camp and bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation to offer an offering unto the lord before the tabernacle of the lord blood shall be imputed unto that man he hath shed blood and

or sacrifice and bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation to offer it unto the lord even that man shall be cut off from among his people and whatsoever man there be of the house of israel or of the strangers that sojourn among you that eateth any manner of blood i will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood and will cut him off from among his people for the life of the flesh is in the blood and i have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul therefore i said unto the children of israel no soul of you shall eat blood neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood and whatsoever man there be of the children of israel or of the strangers that sojourn among you which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten he shall even pour out the blood thereof and cover it with dust for it is the life of all flesh the blood of it is for the life thereof therefore i said unto the children of israel ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof whosoever eateth it shall be cut off and every soul that eateth that which died of itself or that which was torn with beasts whether it be one of your own country or a stranger he shall both wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the even then shall he be clean but if he wash them not nor bathe his flesh then he shall bear his iniquity and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them i am the lord your god after the doings of the land of egypt wherein ye dwelt shall ye not do and after the doings of the land of canaan whither i bring you shall ye not do neither shall ye walk in their ordinances ye shall do my judgments and keep mine
