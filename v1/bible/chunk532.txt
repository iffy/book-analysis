i beseech thee ten days and let them give us pulse to eat and water to drink then let our countenances be looked upon before thee and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the kings meat and as thou seest deal with thy servants so he consented to them in this matter and proved them ten days and at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the kings meat thus melzar took away the portion of their meat and the wine that they should drink and gave them pulse as for these four children god gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom and daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before nebuchadnezzar and the king communed with them and among them all was found none like daniel hananiah mishael and azariah therefore stood they before the king and in all matters of wisdom and understanding that the king enquired of them he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm and daniel continued even unto the first year of king cyrus and in the second year of the reign of nebuchadnezzar nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams wherewith his spirit was troubled and his sleep brake from him then the king commanded to call the magicians and the astrologers and the sorcerers and the chaldeans for to shew the king his dreams so they came and stood before the king and the king said unto them i have dreamed a dream and my spirit was troubled to know the dream then spake the chaldeans to the king in syriack o king live for ever tell thy servants the dream and we will shew the interpretation the king answered and said to the chaldeans the thing is gone from me if ye will not make known unto me the dream with the interpretation thereof ye shall be cut in pieces and your houses shall be made a dunghill but if ye shew the dream and the interpretation thereof ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour therefore shew me the dream and the interpretation thereof they answered again and said let the king tell his servants the dream and we will shew the interpretation of it the king answered and said i know of certainty that ye would gain the time because ye see the thing is gone from me but if ye will not make known unto me the dream there is but one decree for you for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me till the time be changed therefore tell me the dream and i shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof the chaldeans answered before the king and said there is not a man upon the earth that can shew the kings matter therefore there is no king lord nor ruler that asked such things at any magician or astrologer or chaldean and it is a rare thing that the king requireth and there is none other that can shew it before the king except the gods whose dwelling is not with flesh for this cause the king was angry and very furious and commanded to destroy all the wise men of babylon and the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain and they sought daniel and his fellows to be slain then daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to arioch the captain of the kings guard which was gone forth to slay the wise men of babylon he answered and said to arioch the kings captain why is the decree so hasty from the king then arioch made the thing known to daniel then daniel went in and desired of the king that he would give him time and that he would shew the king the interpretation then daniel went to his house and made the thing known to hananiah mishael and azariah his companions that they would desire mercies of the god of heaven concerning this secret that daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of babylon then was the secret revealed unto daniel in a night vision then daniel blessed the god of heaven daniel answered and said blessed be the name of god for ever and ever for wisdom and might are his and he changeth the times and the seasons he removeth kings and setteth up kings he giveth wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to them that know understanding he revealeth the deep and secret things he knoweth what is in the darkness and the light dwelleth with him i thank thee and praise thee o thou god of my fathers who hast given me wisdom and might and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee for thou hast now made known unto us the kings matter therefore daniel went in unto arioch whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of babylon he went and said thus unto him destroy not the wise men of babylon bring me in before the king and i will shew unto the king the interpretation then arioch brought in daniel before the king in haste and said thus unto him i have found a man of the captives of judah that will make known unto the king the interpretation the king answered and said to daniel whose name was belteshazzar art thou able to make known unto me the dream which i have seen and the interpretation thereof daniel answered in the presence of the king and said the secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men the astrologers the magicians the soothsayers shew unto the king but there is a god in heaven that revealeth secrets and maketh known to the king nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days thy dream and the visions of thy head upon thy bed are these as for thee o king thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed what should come to pass hereafter and he that
