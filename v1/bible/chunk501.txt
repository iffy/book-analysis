will recompense their way upon their own heads saith the lord god then did the cherubims lift up their wings and the wheels beside them and the glory of the god of israel was over them above and the glory of the lord went up from the midst of the city and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city afterwards the spirit took me up and brought me in a vision by the spirit of god into chaldea to them of the captivity so the vision that i had seen went up from me then i spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the lord had shewed me the word of the lord also came unto me saying son of man thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house which have eyes to see and see not they have ears to hear and hear not for they are a rebellious house therefore thou son of man prepare thee stuff for removing and remove by day in their sight and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight it may be they will consider though they be a rebellious house then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight as stuff for removing and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight as they that go forth into captivity dig thou through the wall in their sight and carry out thereby in their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders and carry it forth in the twilight thou shalt cover thy face that thou see not the ground for i have set thee for a sign unto the house of israel and i did so as i was commanded i brought forth my stuff by day as stuff for captivity and in the even i digged through the wall with mine hand i brought it forth in the twilight and i bare it upon my shoulder in their sight and in the morning came the word of the lord unto me saying son of man hath not the house of israel the rebellious house said unto thee what doest thou say thou unto them thus saith the lord god this burden concerneth the prince in jerusalem and all the house of israel that are among them say i am your sign like as i have done so shall it be done unto them they shall remove and go into captivity and the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the twilight and shall go forth they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby he shall cover his face that he see not the ground with his eyes my net also will i spread upon him and he shall be taken in my snare and i will bring him to babylon to the land of the chaldeans yet shall he not see it though he shall die there and i will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to help him and all his bands and i will draw out the sword after them and they shall know that i am the lord when i shall scatter them among the nations and disperse them in the countries but i will leave a few men of them from the sword from the famine and from the pestilence that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen whither they come and they shall know that i am the lord moreover the word of the lord came to me saying son of man eat thy bread with quaking and drink thy water with trembling and with carefulness and say unto the people of the land thus saith the lord god of the inhabitants of jerusalem and of the land of israel they shall eat their bread with carefulness and drink their water with astonishment that her land may be desolate from all that is therein because of the violence of all them that dwell therein and the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste and the land shall be desolate and ye shall know that i am the lord and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man what is that proverb that ye have in the land of israel saying the days are prolonged and every vision faileth tell them therefore thus saith the lord god i will make this proverb to cease and they shall no more use it as a proverb in israel but say unto them the days are at hand and the effect of every vision for there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of israel for i am the lord i will speak and the word that i shall speak shall come to pass it shall be no more prolonged for in your days o rebellious house will i say the word and will perform it saith the lord god again the word of the lord came to me saying son of man behold they of the house of israel say the vision that he seeth is for many days to come and he prophesieth of the times that are far off therefore say unto them thus saith the lord god there shall none of my words be prolonged any more but the word which i have spoken shall be done saith the lord god and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man prophesy against the prophets of israel that prophesy and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts hear ye the word of the lord thus saith the lord god woe unto the foolish prophets that follow their own spirit and have seen nothing o israel thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts ye have not gone up into the gaps neither made up the hedge for the house of israel to stand in the battle in the day of the lord they have seen vanity and lying divination saying the lord saith and the lord hath not sent them and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word have ye not seen a vain vision and have ye not spoken a lying divination whereas ye say the lord saith it
