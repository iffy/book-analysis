and they were glad therefore the men of jabesh said to morrow we will come out unto you and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you and it was so on the morrow that saul put the people in three companies and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch and slew the ammonites until the heat of the day and it came to pass that they which remained were scattered so that two of them were not left together and the people said unto samuel who is he that said shall saul reign over us bring the men that we may put them to death and saul said there shall not a man be put to death this day for to day the lord hath wrought salvation in israel then said samuel to the people come and let us go to gilgal and renew the kingdom there and all the people went to gilgal and there they made saul king before the lord in gilgal and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the lord and there saul and all the men of israel rejoiced greatly and samuel said unto all israel behold i have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me and have made a king over you and now behold the king walketh before you and i am old and grayheaded and behold my sons are with you and i have walked before you from my childhood unto this day behold here i am witness against me before the lord and before his anointed whose ox have i taken or whose ass have i taken or whom have i defrauded whom have i oppressed or of whose hand have i received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith and i will restore it you and they said thou hast not defrauded us nor oppressed us neither hast thou taken ought of any mans hand and he said unto them the lord is witness against you and his anointed is witness this day that ye have not found ought in my hand and they answered he is witness and samuel said unto the people it is the lord that advanced moses and aaron and that brought your fathers up out of the land of egypt now therefore stand still that i may reason with you before the lord of all the righteous acts of the lord which he did to you and to your fathers when jacob was come into egypt and your fathers cried unto the lord then the lord sent moses and aaron which brought forth your fathers out of egypt and made them dwell in this place and when they forgat the lord their god he sold them into the hand of sisera captain of the host of hazor and into the hand of the philistines and into the hand of the king of moab and they fought against them and they cried unto the lord and said we have sinned because we have forsaken the lord and have served baalim and ashtaroth but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies and we will serve thee and the lord sent jerubbaal and bedan and jephthah and samuel and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side and ye dwelled safe and when ye saw that nahash the king of the children of ammon came against you ye said unto me nay but a king shall reign over us when the lord your god was your king now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen and whom ye have desired and behold the lord hath set a king over you if ye will fear the lord and serve him and obey his voice and not rebel against the commandment of the lord then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the lord your god but if ye will not obey the voice of the lord but rebel against the commandment of the lord then shall the hand of the lord be against you as it was against your fathers now therefore stand and see this great thing which the lord will do before your eyes is it not wheat harvest to day i will call unto the lord and he shall send thunder and rain that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great which ye have done in the sight of the lord in asking you a king so samuel called unto the lord and the lord sent thunder and rain that day and all the people greatly feared the lord and samuel and all the people said unto samuel pray for thy servants unto the lord thy god that we die not for we have added unto all our sins this evil to ask us a king and samuel said unto the people fear not ye have done all this wickedness yet turn not aside from following the lord but serve the lord with all your heart and turn ye not aside for then should ye go after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver for they are vain for the lord will not forsake his people for his great names sake because it hath pleased the lord to make you his people moreover as for me god forbid that i should sin against the lord in ceasing to pray for you but i will teach you the good and the right way only fear the lord and serve him in truth with all your heart for consider how great things he hath done for you but if ye shall still do wickedly ye shall be consumed both ye and your king saul reigned one year and when he had reigned two years over israel saul chose him three thousand men of israel whereof two thousand were with saul in michmash and in mount bethel and a thousand were with jonathan in gibeah of benjamin and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent and jonathan smote the garrison of the philistines that was in geba and the philistines heard of it and saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land saying let the hebrews hear and all israel heard say that saul had smitten a garrison of the
