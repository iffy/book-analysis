he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him we then as workers together with him beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of god in vain for he saith i have heard thee in a time accepted and in the day of salvation have i succoured thee behold now is the accepted time behold now is the day of salvation giving no offence in any thing that the ministry be not blamed but in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of god in much patience in afflictions in necessities in distresses in stripes in imprisonments in tumults in labours in watchings in fastings by pureness by knowledge by longsuffering by kindness by the holy ghost by love unfeigned by the word of truth by the power of god by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left by honour and dishonour by evil report and good report as deceivers and yet true as unknown and yet well known as dying and behold we live as chastened and not killed as sorrowful yet alway rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and yet possessing all things o ye corinthians our mouth is open unto you our heart is enlarged ye are not straitened in us but ye are straitened in your own bowels now for a recompence in the same i speak as unto my children be ye also enlarged be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness and what concord hath christ with belial or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel and what agreement hath the temple of god with idols for ye are the temple of the living god as god hath said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god receive us we have wronged no man we have corrupted no man we have defrauded no man i speak not this to condemn you for i have said before that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you great is my boldness of speech toward you great is my glorying of you i am filled with comfort i am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation for when we were come into macedonia our flesh had no rest but we were troubled on every side without were fightings within were fears nevertheless god that comforteth those that are cast down comforted us by the coming of titus and not by his coming only but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you when he told us your earnest desire your mourning your fervent mind toward me so that i rejoiced the more for though i made you sorry with a letter i do not repent though i did repent for i perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry though it were but for a season now i rejoice not that ye were made sorry but that ye sorrowed to repentance for ye were made sorry after a godly manner that ye might receive damage by us in nothing for godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world worketh death for behold this selfsame thing that ye sorrowed after a godly sort what carefulness it wrought in you yea what clearing of yourselves yea what indignation yea what fear yea what vehement desire yea what zeal yea what revenge in all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter wherefore though i wrote unto you i did it not for his cause that had done the wrong nor for his cause that suffered wrong but that our care for you in the sight of god might appear unto you therefore we were comforted in your comfort yea and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of titus because his spirit was refreshed by you all for if i have boasted any thing to him of you i am not ashamed but as we spake all things to you in truth even so our boasting which i made before titus is found a truth and his inward affection is more abundant toward you whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all how with fear and trembling ye received him i rejoice therefore that i have confidence in you in all things moreover brethren we do you to wit of the grace of god bestowed on the churches of macedonia how that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality for to their power i bear record yea and beyond their power they were willing of themselves praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints and this they did not as we hoped but first gave their own selves to the lord and unto us by the will of god insomuch that we desired titus that as he had begun so he would also finish in you the same grace also therefore as ye abound in every thing in faith and utterance and knowledge and in all diligence and in your love to us see that ye abound in this grace also i speak not by commandment but by occasion of the forwardness of others and to prove the sincerity of your love for ye know the grace of our lord jesus christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that ye through his poverty might be rich and herein i give my advice for this is expedient for you who have begun before not only to do but also to be forward
