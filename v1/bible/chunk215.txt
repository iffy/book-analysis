feet and uriah departed out of the kings house and there followed him a mess of meat from the king but uriah slept at the door of the kings house with all the servants of his lord and went not down to his house and when they had told david saying uriah went not down unto his house david said unto uriah camest thou not from thy journey why then didst thou not go down unto thine house and uriah said unto david the ark and israel and judah abide in tents and my lord joab and the servants of my lord are encamped in the open fields shall i then go into mine house to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife as thou livest and as thy soul liveth i will not do this thing and david said to uriah tarry here to day also and to morrow i will let thee depart so uriah abode in jerusalem that day and the morrow and when david had called him he did eat and drink before him and he made him drunk and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord but went not down to his house and it came to pass in the morning that david wrote a letter to joab and sent it by the hand of uriah and he wrote in the letter saying set ye uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle and retire ye from him that he may be smitten and die and it came to pass when joab observed the city that he assigned uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were and the men of the city went out and fought with joab and there fell some of the people of the servants of david and uriah the hittite died also then joab sent and told david all the things concerning the war and charged the messenger saying when thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king and if so be that the kings wrath arise and he say unto thee wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall who smote abimelech the son of jerubbesheth did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall that he died in thebez why went ye nigh the wall then say thou thy servant uriah the hittite is dead also so the messenger went and came and shewed david all that joab had sent him for and the messenger said unto david surely the men prevailed against us and came out unto us into the field and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate and the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants and some of the kings servants be dead and thy servant uriah the hittite is dead also then david said unto the messenger thus shalt thou say unto joab let not this thing displease thee for the sword devoureth one as well as another make thy battle more strong against the city and overthrow it and encourage thou him and when the wife of uriah heard that uriah her husband was dead she mourned for her husband and when the mourning was past david sent and fetched her to his house and she became his wife and bare him a son but the thing that david had done displeased the lord and the lord sent nathan unto david and he came unto him and said unto him there were two men in one city the one rich and the other poor the rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds but the poor man had nothing save one little ewe lamb which he had bought and nourished up and it grew up together with him and with his children it did eat of his own meat and drank of his own cup and lay in his bosom and was unto him as a daughter and there came a traveller unto the rich man and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him but took the poor mans lamb and dressed it for the man that was come to him and davids anger was greatly kindled against the man and he said to nathan as the lord liveth the man that hath done this thing shall surely die and he shall restore the lamb fourfold because he did this thing and because he had no pity and nathan said to david thou art the man thus saith the lord god of israel i anointed thee king over israel and i delivered thee out of the hand of saul and i gave thee thy masters house and thy masters wives into thy bosom and gave thee the house of israel and of judah and if that had been too little i would moreover have given unto thee such and such things wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the lord to do evil in his sight thou hast killed uriah the hittite with the sword and hast taken his wife to be thy wife and hast slain him with the sword of the children of ammon now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house because thou hast despised me and hast taken the wife of uriah the hittite to be thy wife thus saith the lord behold i will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house and i will take thy wives before thine eyes and give them unto thy neighbour and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun for thou didst it secretly but i will do this thing before all israel and before the sun and david said unto nathan i have sinned against the lord and nathan said unto david the lord also hath put away thy sin thou shalt not die howbeit because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the lord to blaspheme the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die and nathan departed unto his house and the lord struck the child
