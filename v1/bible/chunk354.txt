the lord unto job out of the whirlwind and said gird up thy loins now like a man i will demand of thee and declare thou unto me wilt thou also disannul my judgment wilt thou condemn me that thou mayest be righteous hast thou an arm like god or canst thou thunder with a voice like him deck thyself now with majesty and excellency and array thyself with glory and beauty cast abroad the rage of thy wrath and behold every one that is proud and abase him look on every one that is proud and bring him low and tread down the wicked in their place hide them in the dust together and bind their faces in secret then will i also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee behold now behemoth which i made with thee he eateth grass as an ox lo now his strength is in his loins and his force is in the navel of his belly he moveth his tail like a cedar the sinews of his stones are wrapped together his bones are as strong pieces of brass his bones are like bars of iron he is the chief of the ways of god he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him surely the mountains bring him forth food where all the beasts of the field play he lieth under the shady trees in the covert of the reed and fens the shady trees cover him with their shadow the willows of the brook compass him about behold he drinketh up a river and hasteth not he trusteth that he can draw up jordan into his mouth he taketh it with his eyes his nose pierceth through snares canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down canst thou put an hook into his nose or bore his jaw through with a thorn will he make many supplications unto thee will he speak soft words unto thee will he make a covenant with thee wilt thou take him for a servant for ever wilt thou play with him as with a bird or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens shall the companions make a banquet of him shall they part him among the merchants canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons or his head with fish spears lay thine hand upon him remember the battle do no more behold the hope of him is in vain shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him none is so fierce that dare stir him up who then is able to stand before me who hath prevented me that i should repay him whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine i will not conceal his parts nor his power nor his comely proportion who can discover the face of his garment or who can come to him with his double bridle who can open the doors of his face his teeth are terrible round about his scales are his pride shut up together as with a close seal one is so near to another that no air can come between them they are joined one to another they stick together that they cannot be sundered by his neesings a light doth shine and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning out of his mouth go burning lamps and sparks of fire leap out out of his nostrils goeth smoke as out of a seething pot or caldron his breath kindleth coals and a flame goeth out of his mouth in his neck remaineth strength and sorrow is turned into joy before him the flakes of his flesh are joined together they are firm in themselves they cannot be moved his heart is as firm as a stone yea as hard as a piece of the nether millstone when he raiseth up himself the mighty are afraid by reason of breakings they purify themselves the sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold the spear the dart nor the habergeon he esteemeth iron as straw and brass as rotten wood the arrow cannot make him flee slingstones are turned with him into stubble darts are counted as stubble he laugheth at the shaking of a spear sharp stones are under him he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire he maketh the deep to boil like a pot he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment he maketh a path to shine after him one would think the deep to be hoary upon earth there is not his like who is made without fear he beholdeth all high things he is a king over all the children of pride then job answered the lord and said i know that thou canst do every thing and that no thought can be withholden from thee who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge therefore have i uttered that i understood not things too wonderful for me which i knew not hear i beseech thee and i will speak i will demand of thee and declare thou unto me i have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now mine eye seeth thee wherefore i abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes and it was so that after the lord had spoken these words unto job the lord said to eliphaz the temanite my wrath is kindled against thee and against thy two friends for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right as my servant job hath therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams and go to my servant job and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering and my servant job shall pray for you for him will i accept lest i deal with you after your folly in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right like my servant job so eliphaz the temanite and bildad the shuhite and zophar the naamathite went and did according as the lord commanded them the lord also accepted job and the lord turned the captivity of job when he prayed for his friends also the lord gave job twice as much as he had before then came there unto him all his brethren and all
