there is no man that receiveth me to house yet there is both straw and provender for our asses and there is bread and wine also for me and for thy handmaid and for the young man which is with thy servants there is no want of any thing and the old man said peace be with thee howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me only lodge not in the street so he brought him into his house and gave provender

door and spake to the master of the house the old man saying bring forth the man that came into thine house that we may know him and the man the master of the house went out unto them and said unto

the door of the house and her hands were upon the threshold and he said unto her up and let us be going but none answered then the man took her up upon an ass and the man rose up and gat him unto his place and when he was come into his house he took a knife and laid hold on his concubine and divided her together with her bones into twelve pieces and sent her into all the coasts of israel and it
