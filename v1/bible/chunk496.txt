the house of israel are impudent and hardhearted behold i have made thy face strong against their faces and thy forehead strong against their foreheads as an adamant harder than flint have i made thy forehead fear them not neither be dismayed at their looks though they be a rebellious house moreover he said unto me son of man all my words that i shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart and hear with thine ears and go get thee to them of the captivity unto the children of thy people and speak unto them and tell them thus saith the lord god whether they will hear or whether they will forbear then the spirit took me up and i heard behind me a voice of a great rushing saying blessed be the glory of the lord from his place i heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another and the noise of the wheels over against them and a noise of a great rushing so the spirit lifted me up and took me away and i went in bitterness in the heat of my spirit but the hand of the lord was strong upon me then i came to them of the captivity at telabib that dwelt by the river of chebar and i sat where they sat and remained there astonished among them seven days and it came to pass at the end of seven days that the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man i have made thee a watchman unto the house of israel therefore hear the word at my mouth and give them warning from me when i say unto the wicked thou shalt surely die and thou givest him not warning nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way to save his life the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will i require at thine hand yet if thou warn the wicked and he turn not from his wickedness nor from his wicked way he shall die in his iniquity but thou hast delivered thy soul again when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness and commit iniquity and i lay a stumbling-block before him he shall die because thou hast not given him warning he shall die in his sin and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered but his blood will i require at thine hand nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man that the righteous sin not and he doth not sin he shall surely live because he is warned also thou hast delivered thy soul and the hand of the lord was there upon me and he said unto me arise go forth into the plain and i will there talk with thee then i arose and went forth into the plain and behold the glory of the lord stood there as the glory which i saw by the river of chebar and i fell on my face then the spirit entered into me and set me upon my feet and spake with me and said unto me go shut thyself within thine house but thou o son of man behold they shall put bands upon thee and shall bind thee with them and thou shalt not go out among them and i will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth that thou shalt be dumb and shalt not be to them a reprover for they are a rebellious house but when i speak with thee i will open thy mouth and thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord god he that heareth let him hear and he that forbeareth let him forbear for they are a rebellious house thou also son of man take thee a tile and lay it before thee and pourtray upon it the city even jerusalem and lay siege against it and build a fort against it and cast a mount against it set the camp also against it and set battering rams against it round about moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city and set thy face against it and it shall be besieged and thou shalt lay siege against it this shall be a sign to the house of israel lie thou also upon thy left side and lay the iniquity of the house of israel upon it according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity for i have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity according to the number of the days three hundred and ninety days so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of israel and when thou hast accomplished them lie again on thy right side and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of judah forty days i have appointed thee each day for a year therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of jerusalem and thine arm shall be uncovered and thou shalt prophesy against it and behold i will lay bands upon thee and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another till thou hast ended the days of thy siege take thou also unto thee wheat and barley and beans and lentiles and millet and fitches and put them in one vessel and make thee bread thereof according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof and thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight twenty shekels a day from time to time shalt thou eat it thou shalt drink also water by measure the sixth part of an hin from time to time shalt thou drink and thou shalt eat it as barley cakes and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man in their sight and the lord said even thus shall the children of israel eat their defiled bread among the gentiles whither i will drive them then said i ah lord god behold my soul hath not been polluted for from my youth up even till now have i not eaten of that which dieth of itself or is torn in
