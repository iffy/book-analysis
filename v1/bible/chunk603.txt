had spoken the parable against them and they left him and went their way and they send unto him certain of the pharisees and of the herodians to catch him in his words and when they were come they say unto him master we know that thou art true and carest for no man for thou regardest not the person of men but teachest the way of god in truth is it lawful to give tribute to caesar or not shall we give or shall we not give but he knowing their hypocrisy said unto them why tempt ye me bring me a penny that i may see it and they brought it and he saith unto them whose is this image and superscription and they said unto him caesars and jesus answering said unto them render to caesar the things that are caesars and to god the things that are gods and they marvelled at him then come unto him the sadducees which say there is no resurrection and they asked him saying master moses wrote unto us if a mans brother die and leave his wife behind him and leave no children that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother now there were seven brethren and the first took a wife and dying left no seed and the second took her and died neither left he any seed and the third likewise and the seven had her and left no seed last of all the woman died also in the resurrection therefore when they shall rise whose wife shall she be of them for the seven had her to wife and jesus answering said unto them do ye not therefore err because ye know not the scriptures neither the power of god for when they shall rise from the dead they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels which are in heaven and as touching the dead that they rise have ye not read in the book of moses how in the bush god spake unto him saying i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob he is not the god of the dead but the god of the living ye therefore do greatly err and one of the scribes came and having heard them reasoning together and perceiving that he had answered them well asked him which is the first commandment of all and jesus answered him the first of all the commandments is hear o israel the lord our god is one lord and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment and the second is like namely this thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself there is none other commandment greater than these and the scribe said unto him well master thou hast said the truth for there is one god and there is none other but he and to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the soul and with all the strength and to love his neighbour as himself is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices and when jesus saw that he answered discreetly he said unto him thou art not far from the kingdom of god and no man after that durst ask him any question and jesus answered and said while he taught in the temple how say the scribes that christ is the son of david for david himself said by the holy ghost the lord said to my lord sit thou on my right hand till i make thine enemies thy footstool david therefore himself calleth him lord and whence is he then his son and the common people heard him gladly and he said unto them in his doctrine beware of the scribes which love to go in long clothing and love salutations in the marketplaces and the chief seats in the synagogues and the uppermost rooms at feasts which devour widows houses and for a pretence make long prayers these shall receive greater damnation and jesus sat over against the treasury and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury and many that were rich cast in much and there came a certain poor widow and she threw in two mites which make a farthing and he called unto him his disciples and saith unto them verily i say unto you that this poor widow hath cast more in than all they which have cast into the treasury for all they did cast in of their abundance but she of her want did cast in all that she had even all her living and as he went out of the temple one of his disciples saith unto him master see what manner of stones and what buildings are here and jesus answering said unto him seest thou these great buildings there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and as he sat upon the mount of olives over against the temple peter and james and john and andrew asked him privately tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled and jesus answering them began to say take heed lest any man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and shall deceive many and when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars be ye not troubled for such things must needs be but the end shall not be yet for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be earthquakes in divers places and there shall be famines and troubles these are the beginnings of sorrows but take heed to yourselves for they shall deliver you up to councils and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake for a testimony against them and the gospel must first be published among all nations but when they shall lead you and deliver you up take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak neither do ye premeditate but whatsoever shall be given you in
