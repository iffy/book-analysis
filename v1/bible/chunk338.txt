among them and the lord said unto satan whence comest thou then satan answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it and the lord said unto satan hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that feareth god and escheweth evil then satan answered the lord and said doth job fear god for nought hast not thou made an hedge about him and about his house and about all that he hath on every side thou hast blessed the work of his hands and his substance is increased in the land but put forth thine hand now and touch all that he hath and he will curse thee to thy face and the lord said unto satan behold all that he hath is in thy power only upon himself put not forth thine hand so satan went forth from the presence of the lord and there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brothers house and there came a messenger unto job and said the oxen were plowing and the asses feeding beside them and the sabeans fell upon them and took them away yea they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword and i only am escaped alone to tell thee while he was yet speaking there came also another and said the fire of god is fallen from heaven and hath burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them and i only am escaped alone to tell thee while he was yet speaking there came also another and said the chaldeans made out three bands and fell upon the camels and have carried them away yea and slain the servants with the edge of the sword and i only am escaped alone to tell thee while he was yet speaking there came also another and said thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brothers house and behold there came a great wind from the wilderness and smote the four corners of the house and it fell upon the young men and they are dead and i only am escaped alone to tell thee then job arose and rent his mantle and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and worshipped and said naked came i out of my mothers womb and naked shall i return thither the lord gave and the lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the lord in all this job sinned not nor charged god foolishly again there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan came also among them to present himself before the lord and the lord said unto satan from whence comest thou and satan answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it and the lord said unto satan hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that feareth god and escheweth evil and still he holdeth fast his integrity although thou movedst me against him to destroy him without cause and satan answered the lord and said skin for skin yea all that a man hath will he give for his life but put forth thine hand now and touch his bone and his flesh and he will curse thee to thy face and the lord said unto satan behold he is in thine hand but save his life so went satan forth from the presence of the lord and smote job with sore boils from the sole of his foot
