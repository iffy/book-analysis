maketh himself a prophet to you for therefore he sent unto us in babylon saying this captivity is long build ye houses and dwell in them and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them and zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of jeremiah the prophet then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah saying send to all them of the captivity saying thus saith the lord concerning shemaiah the nehelamite because that shemaiah hath prophesied unto you and i sent him not and he caused you to trust in a lie therefore thus saith the lord behold i will punish shemaiah the nehelamite and his seed he shall not have a man to dwell among this people neither shall he behold the good that i will do for my people saith the lord because he hath taught rebellion against the lord the word that came to jeremiah from the lord saying thus speaketh the lord god of israel saying write thee all the words that i have spoken unto thee in a book for lo the days come saith the lord that i will bring again the captivity of my people israel and judah saith the lord and i will cause them to return to the land that i gave to their fathers and they shall possess it and these are the words that the lord spake concerning israel and concerning judah for thus saith the lord we have heard a voice of trembling of fear and not of peace ask ye now and see whether a man doth travail with child wherefore do i see every man with his hands on his loins as a woman in travail and all faces are turned into paleness alas for that day is great so that none is like it it is even the time of jacobs trouble but he shall be saved out of it for it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord of hosts that i will break his yoke from off thy neck and will burst thy bonds and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him but they shall serve the lord their god and david their king whom i will raise up unto them therefore fear thou not o my servant jacob saith the lord neither be dismayed o israel for lo i will save thee from afar and thy seed from the land of their captivity and jacob shall return and shall be in rest and be quiet and none shall make him afraid for i am with thee saith the lord to save thee though i make a full end of all nations whither i have scattered thee yet i will not make a full end of thee but i will correct thee in measure and will not leave thee altogether unpunished for thus saith the lord thy bruise is incurable and thy wound is grievous there is none to plead thy cause that thou mayest be bound up thou hast no healing medicines all thy lovers have forgotten thee they seek thee not for i have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy with the chastisement of a cruel one for the multitude of thine iniquity because thy sins were increased why criest thou for thine affliction thy sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity because thy sins were increased i have done these things unto thee therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured and all thine adversaries every one of them shall go into captivity and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil and all that prey upon thee will i give for a prey for i will restore health unto thee and i will heal thee of thy wounds saith the lord because they called thee an outcast saying this is zion whom no man seeketh after thus saith the lord behold i will bring again the captivity of jacobs tents and have mercy on his dwellingplaces and the city shall be builded upon her own heap and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof and out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry and i will multiply them and they shall not be few i will also glorify them and they shall not be small their children also shall be as aforetime and their congregation shall be established before me and i will punish all that oppress them and their nobles shall be of themselves and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them and i will cause him to draw near and he shall approach unto me for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me saith the lord and ye shall be my people and i will be your god behold the whirlwind of the lord goeth forth with fury a continuing whirlwind it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked the fierce anger of the lord shall not return until he hath done it and until he have performed the intents of his heart in the latter days ye shall consider it at the same time saith the lord will i be the god of all the families of israel and they shall be my people thus saith the lord the people which were left of the sword found grace in the wilderness even israel when i went to cause him to rest the lord hath appeared of old unto me saying yea i have loved thee with an everlasting love therefore with lovingkindness have i drawn thee again i will build thee and thou shalt be built o virgin of israel thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of samaria the planters shall plant and shall eat them as common things for there shall be a day that the watchmen upon the mount ephraim shall cry arise ye and let us go up to zion unto the lord our god for thus saith the lord sing with gladness for jacob and shout among the chief of the nations publish ye praise ye and say o lord save thy people the remnant of israel behold i will bring them from the north country and gather them
