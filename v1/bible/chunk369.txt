hath seen his desire upon mine enemies give ear to my prayer o god and hide not thyself from my supplication attend unto me and hear me i mourn in my complaint and make a noise because of the voice of the enemy because of the oppression of the wicked for they cast iniquity upon me and in wrath they hate me my heart is sore pained within me and the terrors of death are fallen upon me fearfulness and trembling are come upon me and horror hath overwhelmed me and i said oh that i had wings like a dove for then would i fly away and be at rest lo then would i wander far off and remain in the wilderness selah i would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest destroy o lord and divide their tongues for i have seen violence and strife in the city day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it wickedness is in the midst thereof deceit and guile depart not from her streets for it was not an enemy that reproached me then i could have borne it neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me then i would have hid myself from him but it was thou a man mine equal my guide and mine acquaintance we took sweet counsel together and walked unto the house of god in company let death seize upon them and let them go down quick into hell for wickedness is in their dwellings and among them as for me i will call upon god and the lord shall save me evening and morning and at noon will i pray and cry aloud and he shall hear my voice he hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me for there were many with me god shall hear and afflict them even he that abideth of old selah because they have no changes therefore they fear not god he hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him he hath broken his covenant the words of his mouth were smoother than butter but war was in his heart his words were softer than oil yet were they drawn swords cast thy burden upon the lord and he shall sustain thee he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved but thou o god shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days but i will trust in thee be merciful unto me o god for man would swallow me up he fighting daily oppresseth me mine enemies would daily swallow me up for they be many that fight against me o thou most high what time i am afraid i will trust in thee in god i will praise his word in god i have put my trust i will not fear what flesh can do unto me every day they wrest my words all their thoughts are against me for evil they gather themselves together they hide themselves they mark my steps when they wait for my soul shall they escape by iniquity in thine anger cast down the people o god thou tellest my wanderings put thou my tears into thy bottle are they not in thy book when i cry unto thee then shall mine enemies turn back this i know for god is for me in god will i praise his word in the lord will i praise his word in god have i put my trust i will not be afraid what man can do unto me thy vows are upon me o god i will render praises unto thee for thou hast delivered my soul from death wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling that i may walk before god in the light of the living be merciful unto me o god be merciful unto me for my soul trusteth in thee yea in the shadow of thy wings will i make my refuge until these calamities be overpast i will cry unto god most high unto god that performeth all things for me he shall send from heaven and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up selah god shall send forth his mercy and his truth my soul is among lions and i lie even among them that are set on fire even the sons of men whose teeth are spears and arrows and their tongue a sharp sword be thou exalted o god above the heavens let thy glory be above all the earth they have prepared a net for my steps my soul is bowed down they have digged a pit before me into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves selah my heart is fixed o god my heart is fixed i will sing and give praise awake up my glory awake psaltery and harp i myself will awake early i will praise thee o lord among the people i will sing unto thee among the nations for thy mercy is great unto the heavens and thy truth unto the clouds be thou exalted o god above the heavens let thy glory be above all the earth do ye indeed speak righteousness o congregation do ye judge uprightly o ye sons of men yea in heart ye work wickedness ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth the wicked are estranged from the womb they go astray as soon as they be born speaking lies their poison is like the poison of a serpent they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear which will not hearken to the voice of charmers charming never so wisely break their teeth o god in their mouth break out the great teeth of the young lions o lord let them melt away as waters which run continually when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows let them be as cut in pieces as a snail which melteth let every one of them pass away like the untimely birth of a woman that they may not see the sun before your pots can feel the thorns he shall take them away as with a whirlwind both living and
