it they brought the rest of the money before the king and jehoiada whereof were made vessels for the house of the lord even vessels to minister and to offer withal and spoons and vessels of gold and silver and they offered burnt offerings in the house of the lord continually all the days of jehoiada but jehoiada waxed old and was full of days when he died an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died and they buried him in the city of david among the kings because he had done good in israel both toward god and toward his house now after the death of jehoiada came the princes of judah and made obeisance to the king then the king hearkened unto them and they left the house of the lord god of their fathers and served groves and idols and wrath came upon judah and jerusalem for this their trespass yet he sent prophets to them to bring them again unto the lord and they testified against them but they would not give ear and the spirit of god came upon zechariah the son of jehoiada the priest which stood above the people and said unto them thus saith god why transgress ye the commandments of the lord that ye cannot prosper because ye have forsaken the lord he hath also forsaken you and they conspired against him and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the lord thus joash the king remembered not the kindness which jehoiada his father had done to him but slew his son and when he died he said the lord look upon it and require it and it came to pass at the end of the year that the host of syria came up against him and they came to judah and jerusalem and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of damascus for the army of the syrians came with a small company of men and the lord delivered a very great host into their hand because they had forsaken the lord god of their fathers so they executed judgment against joash and when they were departed from him for they left him in great diseases his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of jehoiada the priest and slew him on his bed and he died and they buried him in the city of david but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings and these are they that conspired against him zabad the son of shimeath an ammonitess and jehozabad the son of shimrith a moabitess now concerning his sons and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him and the repairing of the house of god behold they are written in the story of the book of the kings and amaziah his son reigned in his stead amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and nine years in jerusalem and his mothers name was jehoaddan of jerusalem and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord but not with a perfect heart now it came to pass when the kingdom was established to him that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father but he slew not their children but did as it is written in the law in the book of moses where the lord commanded saying the fathers shall not die for the children neither shall the children die for the fathers but every man shall die for his own sin moreover amaziah gathered judah together and made them captains over thousands and captains over hundreds according to the houses of their fathers throughout all judah and benjamin and he numbered them from twenty years old and above and found them three hundred thousand choice men able to go forth to war that could handle spear and shield he hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of israel for an hundred talents of silver but there came a man of god to him saying o king let not the army of israel go with thee for the lord is not with israel to wit with all the children of ephraim but if thou wilt go do it be strong for the battle god shall make thee fall before the enemy for god hath power to help and to cast down and amaziah said to the man of god but what shall we do for the hundred talents which i have given to the army of israel and the man of god answered the lord is able to give thee much more than this then amaziah separated them to wit the army that was come to him out of ephraim to go home again wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against judah and they returned home in great anger and amaziah strengthened himself and led forth his people and went to the valley of salt and smote of the children of seir ten thousand and other ten thousand left alive did the children of judah carry away captive and brought them unto the top of the rock and cast them down from the top of the rock that they all were broken in pieces but the soldiers of the army which amaziah sent back that they should not go with him to battle fell upon the cities of judah from samaria even unto bethhoron and smote three thousand of them and took much spoil now it came to pass after that amaziah was come from the slaughter of the edomites that he brought the gods of the children of seir and set them up to be his gods and bowed down himself before them and burned incense unto them wherefore the anger of the lord was kindled against amaziah and he sent unto him a prophet which said unto him why hast thou sought after the gods of the people which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand and it came to pass as he talked
