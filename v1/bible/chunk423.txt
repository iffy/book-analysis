from the islands of the sea and he shall set up an ensign for the nations and shall assemble the outcasts of israel and gather together the dispersed of judah from the four corners of the earth the envy also of ephraim shall depart and the adversaries of judah shall be cut off ephraim shall not envy judah and judah shall not vex ephraim but they shall fly upon the shoulders of the philistines toward the west they shall spoil them of the east together they shall lay their hand upon edom and moab and the children of ammon shall obey them and the lord shall utterly destroy the tongue of the egyptian sea and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river and shall smite it in the seven streams and make men go over dryshod and there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people which shall be left from assyria like as it was to israel in the day that he came up out of the land of egypt and in that day thou shalt say o lord i will praise thee though thou wast angry with me thine anger is turned away and thou comfortedst me behold god is my salvation i will trust and not be afraid for the lord jehovah is my strength and my song he also is become my salvation therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation and in that day shall ye say praise the lord call upon his name declare his doings among the people make mention that his name is exalted sing unto the lord for he hath done excellent things this is known in all the earth cry out and shout thou inhabitant of zion for great is the holy one of israel in the midst of thee the burden of babylon which isaiah the son of amoz did see lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain exalt the voice unto them shake the hand that they may go into the gates of the nobles i have commanded my sanctified ones i have also called my mighty ones for mine anger even them that rejoice in my highness the noise of a multitude in the mountains like as of a great people a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together the lord of hosts mustereth the host of the battle they come from a far country from the end of heaven even the lord and the weapons of his indignation to destroy the whole land howl ye for the day of the lord is at hand it shall come as a destruction from the almighty therefore shall all hands be faint and every mans heart shall melt and they shall be afraid pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth they shall be amazed one at another their faces shall be as flames behold the day of the lord cometh cruel both with wrath and fierce anger to lay the land desolate and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it for the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light the sun shall be darkened in his going forth and the moon shall not cause her light to shine and i will punish the world for their evil and the wicked for their iniquity and i will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible i will make a man more precious than fine gold even a man than the golden wedge of ophir therefore i will shake the heavens and the earth shall remove out of her place in the wrath of the lord of hosts and in the day of his fierce anger and it shall be as the chased roe and as a sheep that no man taketh up they shall every man turn to his own people and flee every one into his own land every one that is found shall be thrust through and every one that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes their houses shall be spoiled and their wives ravished behold i will stir up the medes against them which shall not regard silver and as for gold they shall not delight in it their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb their eyes shall not spare children and babylon the glory of kingdoms the beauty of the chaldees excellency shall be as when god overthrew sodom and gomorrah it shall never be inhabited neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation neither shall the arabian pitch tent there neither shall the shepherds make their fold there but wild beasts of the desert shall lie there and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures and owls shall dwell there and satyrs shall dance there and the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses and dragons in their pleasant palaces and her time is near to come and her days shall not be prolonged for the lord will have mercy on jacob and will yet choose israel and set them in their own land and the strangers shall be joined with them and they shall cleave to the house of jacob and the people shall take them and bring them to their place and the house of israel shall possess them in the land of the lord for servants and handmaids and they shall take them captives whose captives they were and they shall rule over their oppressors and it shall come to pass in the day that the lord shall give thee rest from thy sorrow and from thy fear and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve that thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of babylon and say how hath the oppressor ceased the golden city ceased the lord hath broken the staff of the wicked and the sceptre of the rulers he who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke he that ruled the nations in anger is persecuted and none hindereth the
