man unto his tent and retained those three hundred men and the host of midian was beneath him in the valley and it came to pass the same night that the lord said unto him arise get thee down unto the host for i have delivered it into thine hand but if thou fear to go down go thou with phurah thy servant down to the host and thou shalt hear what they say and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host then went he down with phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host and the midianites and the amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude and their camels were without number as the sand by the sea side for multitude and when gideon was come behold there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow and said behold i dreamed a dream and lo a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of midian and came unto a tent and smote it that it fell and overturned it that the tent lay along and his fellow answered and said this is nothing else save the sword of gideon the son of joash a man of israel for into his hand hath god delivered midian and all the host and it was so when gideon heard the telling of the dream and the interpretation thereof that he worshipped and returned into the host of israel and said arise for the lord hath delivered into your hand the host of midian and he divided the three hundred men into three companies and he put a trumpet in every mans hand with empty pitchers and lamps within the pitchers and he said unto them look on me and do likewise and behold when i come to the outside of the camp it shall be that as i do so shall ye do when i blow with a trumpet i and all that are with me then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp and say the sword of the lord and of gideon so gideon and the hundred men that were with him came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch and they had but newly set the watch and they blew the trumpets and brake the pitchers that were in their hands and the three companies blew the trumpets and brake the pitchers and held the lamps in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands to blow withal and they cried the sword of the lord and of gideon and they stood every man in his place round about the camp and all the host ran and cried and fled and the three hundred blew the trumpets and the lord set every mans sword against his fellow even throughout all the host and the host fled to bethshittah in zererath and to the border of abelmeholah unto tabbath and the men of israel gathered themselves together out of naphtali and out of asher and out of all manasseh and pursued after the midianites and gideon sent messengers throughout all mount ephraim saying come down against the midianites and take before them the waters unto bethbarah and jordan then all the men of ephraim gathered themselves together and took the waters unto bethbarah and jordan and they took two princes of the midianites oreb and zeeb and they slew oreb upon the rock oreb and zeeb they slew at the winepress of zeeb and pursued midian and brought the heads of oreb and zeeb to gideon on the other side jordan and the men of ephraim said unto him why hast thou served us thus that thou calledst us not when thou wentest to fight with the midianites and they did chide with him sharply and he said unto them what have i done now in comparison of you is not the gleaning of the grapes of ephraim better than the vintage of abiezer god hath delivered into your hands the princes of midian oreb and zeeb and what was i able to do in comparison of you then their anger was abated toward him when he had said that and gideon came to jordan and passed over he and the three hundred men that were with him faint yet pursuing them and he said unto the men of succoth give i pray you loaves of bread unto the people that follow me for they be faint and i am pursuing after zebah and zalmunna kings of midian and the princes of succoth said are the hands of zebah and zalmunna now in thine hand that we should give bread unto thine army and gideon said therefore when the lord hath delivered zebah and zalmunna into mine hand then i will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers and he went up thence to penuel and spake unto them likewise and the men of penuel answered him as the men of succoth had answered him and he spake also unto the men of penuel saying when i come again in peace i will break down this tower now zebah and zalmunna were in karkor and their hosts with them about fifteen thousand men all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword and gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of nobah and jogbehah and smote the host for the host was secure and when zebah and zalmunna fled he pursued after them and took the two kings of midian zebah and zalmunna and discomfited all the host and gideon the son of joash returned from battle before the sun was up and caught a young man of the men of succoth and enquired of him and he described unto him the princes of succoth and the elders thereof even threescore and seventeen men and he came unto the men of succoth and said behold zebah and zalmunna with whom ye did upbraid me saying are the hands of zebah and zalmunna now in thine hand that we should give
