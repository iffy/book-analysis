into a city called nain and many of his disciples went with him and much people now when he came nigh to the gate of the city behold there was a dead man carried out the only son of his mother and she was a widow and much people of the city was with her and when the lord saw her he had compassion on her and said unto her weep not and he came and touched the bier and they that bare him stood still and he said young man i say unto thee arise and he that was dead sat up and began to speak and he delivered him to his mother and there came a fear on all and they glorified god saying that a great prophet is risen up among us and that god hath visited his people and this rumour of him went forth throughout all judaea and throughout all the region round about and the disciples of john shewed him of all these things and john calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to jesus saying art thou he that should come or look we for another when the men were come unto him they said john baptist hath sent us unto thee saying art thou he that should come or look we for another and in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues and of evil spirits and unto many that were blind he gave sight then jesus answering said unto them go your way and tell john what things ye have seen and heard how that the blind see the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised to the poor the gospel is preached and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me and when the messengers of john were departed he began to speak unto the people concerning john what went ye out into the wilderness for to see a reed shaken with the wind but what went ye out for to see a man clothed in soft raiment behold they which are gorgeously apparelled and live delicately are in kings courts but what went ye out for to see a prophet yea i say unto you and much more than a prophet this is he of whom it is written behold i send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee for i say unto you among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than john the baptist but he that is least in the kingdom of god is greater than he and all the people that heard him and the publicans justified god being baptized with the baptism of john but the pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of god against themselves being not baptized of him and the lord said whereunto then shall i liken the men of this generation and to what are they like they are like unto children sitting in the marketplace and calling one to another and saying we have piped unto you and ye have not danced we have mourned to you and ye have not wept for john the baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine and ye say he hath a devil the son of man is come eating and drinking and ye say behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber a friend of publicans and sinners but wisdom is justified of all her children and one of the pharisees desired him that he would eat with him and he went into the pharisees house and sat down to meat and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that jesus sat at meat in the pharisees house brought an alabaster box of ointment and stood at his feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment now when the pharisee which had bidden him saw it he spake within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him for she is a sinner and jesus answering said unto him simon i have somewhat to say unto thee and he saith master say on there was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owed five hundred pence and the other fifty and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them will love him most simon answered and said i suppose that he to whom he forgave most and he said unto him thou hast rightly judged and he turned to the woman and said unto simon seest thou this woman i entered into thine house thou gavest me no water for my feet but she hath washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time i came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil thou didst not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment wherefore i say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is forgiven the same loveth little and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven and they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves who is this that forgiveth sins also and he said to the woman thy faith hath saved thee go in peace and it came to pass afterward that he went throughout every city and village preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of god and the twelve were with him and certain women which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities mary called magdalene out of whom went seven devils and joanna the wife of chuza herods steward and susanna and many others which ministered unto him of their substance and when much people were gathered together and were come to him out of every city he spake by a parable a sower went out to sow his seed and as he sowed some fell by the way side and it was trodden
