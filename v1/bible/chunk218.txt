it is because the people have made me afraid and thy handmaid said i will now speak unto the king it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid for the king will hear to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of god then thine handmaid said the word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable for as an angel of god so is my lord the king to discern good and bad therefore the lord thy god will be with thee then the king answered and said unto the woman hide not from me i pray thee the thing that i shall ask thee and the woman said let my lord the king now speak and the king said is not the hand of joab with thee in all this and the woman answered and said as thy soul liveth my lord the king none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken for thy servant joab he bade me and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid to fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant joab done this thing and my lord is wise according to the wisdom of an angel of god to know all things that are in the earth and the king said unto joab behold now i have done this thing go therefore bring the young man absalom again and joab fell to the ground on his face and bowed himself and thanked the king and joab said to day thy servant knoweth that i have found grace in thy sight my lord o king in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant so joab arose and went to geshur and brought absalom to jerusalem and the king said let him turn to his own house and let him not see my face so absalom returned to his own house and saw not the kings face but in all israel there was none to be so much praised as absalom for his beauty from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him and when he polled his head for it was at every years end that he polled it because the hair was heavy on him therefore he polled it he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the kings weight and unto absalom there were born three sons and one daughter whose name was tamar she was a woman of a fair countenance so absalom dwelt two full years in jerusalem and saw not the kings face therefore absalom sent for joab to have sent him to the king but he would not come to him and when he sent again the second time he would not come therefore he said unto his servants see joabs field is near mine and he hath barley there go and set it on fire and absaloms servants set the field on fire then joab arose and came to absalom unto his house and said unto him wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire and absalom answered joab behold i sent unto thee saying come hither that i may send thee to the king to say wherefore am i come from geshur it had been good for me to have been there still now therefore let me see the kings face and if there be any iniquity in me let him kill me so joab came to the king and told him and when he had called for absalom he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king and the king kissed absalom and it came to pass after this that absalom prepared him chariots and horses and fifty men to run before him and absalom rose up early and stood beside the way of the gate and it was so that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment then absalom called unto him and said of what city art thou and he said thy servant is of one of the tribes of israel and absalom said unto him see thy matters are good and right but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee absalom said moreover oh that i were made judge in the land that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me and i would do him justice and it was so that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance he put forth his hand and took him and kissed him and on this manner did absalom to all israel that came to the king for judgment so absalom stole the hearts of the men of israel and it came to pass after forty years that absalom said unto the king i pray thee let me go and pay my vow which i have vowed unto the lord in hebron for thy servant vowed a vow while i abode at geshur in syria saying if the lord shall bring me again indeed to jerusalem then i will serve the lord and the king said unto him go in peace so he arose and went to hebron but absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of israel saying as soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet then ye shall say absalom reigneth in hebron and with absalom went two hundred men out of jerusalem that were called and they went in their simplicity and they knew not any thing and absalom sent for ahithophel the gilonite davids counsellor from his city even from giloh while he offered sacrifices and the conspiracy was strong for the people increased continually with absalom and there came a messenger to david saying the hearts of the men of israel are after absalom and david said unto all his servants that were with him at jerusalem arise and let us flee for we shall not else escape from absalom make speed to depart lest he overtake us suddenly and bring evil upon us and smite the city with the edge of the
