the east shall be holy unto the lord it shall not be plucked up nor thrown down any more for ever the word that came to jeremiah from the lord in the tenth year of zedekiah king of judah which was the eighteenth year of nebuchadrezzar for then the king of babylons army besieged jerusalem and jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison which was in the king of judahs house for zedekiah king of judah had shut him up saying wherefore dost thou prophesy and say thus saith the lord behold i will give this city into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall take it and zedekiah king of judah shall not escape out of the hand of the chaldeans but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of babylon and shall speak with him mouth to mouth and his eyes shall behold his eyes and he shall lead zedekiah to babylon and there shall he be until i visit him saith the lord though ye fight with the chaldeans ye shall not prosper and jeremiah said the word of the lord came unto me saying behold hanameel the son of shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee saying buy thee my field that is in anathoth for the right of redemption is thine to buy it so hanameel mine uncles son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the lord and said unto me buy my field i pray thee that is in anathoth which is in the country of benjamin for the right of inheritance is thine and the redemption is thine buy it for thyself then i knew that this was the word of the lord and i bought the field of hanameel my uncles son that was in anathoth and weighed him the money even seventeen shekels of silver and i subscribed the evidence and sealed it and took witnesses and weighed him the money in the balances so i took the evidence of the purchase both that which was sealed according to the law and custom and that which was open and i gave the evidence of the purchase unto baruch the son of neriah the son of maaseiah in the sight of hanameel mine uncles son and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase before all the jews that sat in the court of the prison and i charged baruch before them saying thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel take these evidences this evidence of the purchase both which is sealed and this evidence which is open and put them in an earthen vessel that they may continue many days for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land now when i had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto baruch the son of neriah i prayed unto the lord saying ah lord god behold thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm and there is nothing too hard for thee thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them the great the mighty god the lord of hosts is his name great in counsel and mighty in work for thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men to give every one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings which hast set signs and wonders in the land of egypt even unto this day and in israel and among other men and hast made thee a name as at this day and hast brought forth thy people israel out of the land of egypt with signs and with wonders and with a strong hand and with a stretched out arm and with great terror and hast given them this land which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them a land flowing with milk and honey and they came in and

hast spoken is come to pass and behold thou seest it and thou hast said unto me o lord god buy thee the field for money and take witnesses for the city is given into the hand of the chaldeans then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah saying behold i am the lord the god of all flesh is there any thing too hard for me therefore thus saith the lord behold i will give this city into the hand of

to provoke me to anger they their kings their princes their priests and their prophets and the men of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem and they have turned unto me the back and not the face
