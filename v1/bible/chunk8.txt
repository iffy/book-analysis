the king of sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of chedorlaomer and of the kings that were with him at the valley of shaveh which is the kings dale and melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the most high god and he blessed him and said blessed be abram of the most high god possessor of heaven and earth and blessed be the most high god which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he gave him tithes of all and the king of sodom said unto abram give me the persons and take the goods to thyself and abram said to the king of sodom i have lift up mine hand unto the lord the most high god the possessor of heaven and earth that i will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet and that i will not take any thing that is thine lest thou shouldest say i have made abram rich save only that which the young men have eaten and the portion of the men which went with me aner eshcol and mamre let them take their portion after these things the word of the lord came unto abram in a vision saying fear not abram i am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward and abram said lord god what wilt thou give me seeing i go childless and the steward of my house is this eliezer of damascus and abram said behold to me thou hast given no seed and lo one born in my house is mine heir and behold the word of the lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be and he believed in the lord and he counted it to him for righteousness and he said unto him i am the lord that brought thee out of ur of the chaldees to give thee this land to inherit it and he said lord god whereby shall i know that i shall inherit it and he said unto him take me an heifer of three years old and a she goat of three years old and a ram of three years old and a turtledove and a young pigeon and he took unto him all these and divided them in the midst and laid each piece one against another but the birds divided he not and when the fowls came down upon the carcases abram drove them away and when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon abram and lo an horror of great darkness fell upon him and he said unto abram know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them and they shall afflict them four hundred years and also that nation whom they shall serve will i judge and afterward shall they come out with great substance and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace thou shalt be buried in a good old age but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full and it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces in the same day the lord made a covenant with abram saying unto thy seed have i given this land from the river of egypt unto the great river the river euphrates the kenites and the kenizzites and the kadmonites and the hittites and the perizzites and the rephaims and the amorites and the canaanites and the girgashites and the jebusites now sarai abrams wife bare him no children and she had an handmaid an egyptian whose name was hagar and sarai said unto abram behold now the lord hath restrained me from bearing i pray thee go in unto my maid it may be that i may obtain children by her and abram hearkened to the voice of sarai and sarai abrams wife took hagar her maid the egyptian after abram had dwelt ten years in the land of canaan and gave her to her husband abram to be his wife and he went in unto hagar and she conceived and when she saw that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes and sarai said unto abram my wrong be upon thee i have given my maid into thy bosom and when she saw that she had conceived i was despised in her eyes the lord judge between me and thee but abram said unto sarai behold thy maid is in thine hand do to her as it pleaseth thee and when sarai dealt hardly with her she fled from her face and the angel of the lord found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness by the fountain in the way to shur and he said hagar sarais maid whence camest thou and whither wilt thou go and she said i flee from the face of my mistress sarai and the angel of the lord said unto her return to thy mistress and submit thyself under her hands and the angel of the lord said unto her i will multiply thy seed exceedingly that it shall not be numbered for multitude and the angel of the lord said unto her behold thou art with child and shalt bear a son and shalt call his name ishmael because the lord hath heard thy affliction and he will be a wild man his hand will be against every man and every mans hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren and she called the name of the lord that spake unto her thou god seest me for she said have i also here looked after him that seeth me wherefore the well was called beerlahairoi behold it is between kadesh and bered and hagar bare abram a son and abram called his sons name which hagar bare
