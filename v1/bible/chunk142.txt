toward her daughter and toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet and toward her children which she shall bear for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and straitness wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates if thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name the lord thy god then the lord will make thy plagues wonderful and the plagues of thy seed even great plagues and of long continuance and sore sicknesses and of long continuance moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of egypt which thou wast afraid of and they shall cleave unto thee also every sickness and every plague which is not written in the book of this law them will the lord bring upon thee until thou be destroyed and ye shall be left few in number whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the lord thy god and it shall come to pass that as the lord rejoiced over you to do you good and to multiply you so the lord will rejoice over you to destroy you and to bring you to nought and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it and the lord shall scatter thee among all people from the one end of the earth even unto the other and there thou shalt serve other gods which neither thou nor thy fathers have known even wood and stone and among these nations shalt thou find no ease neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest but the lord shall give thee there a trembling heart and failing of eyes and sorrow of mind and thy life shall hang in doubt before thee and thou shalt fear day and night and shalt have none assurance of thy life in the morning thou shalt say would god it were even and at even thou shalt say would god it were morning for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see and the lord shall bring thee into egypt again with ships by the way whereof i spake unto thee thou shalt see it no more again and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen and no man shall buy you these are the words of the covenant which the lord commanded moses to make with the children of israel in the land of moab beside the covenant which he made with them in horeb and moses called unto all israel and said unto them ye have seen all that the lord did before your eyes in the land of egypt unto pharaoh and unto all his servants and unto all his land the great temptations which thine eyes have seen the signs and those great miracles yet the lord hath not given you an heart to perceive and eyes to see and ears to hear unto this day and i have led you forty years in the wilderness your clothes are not waxen old upon you and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot ye have not eaten bread neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink that ye might know that i am the lord your god and when ye came unto this place sihon the king of heshbon and og the king of bashan came out against us unto battle and we smote them and we took their land and gave it for an inheritance unto the reubenites and to the gadites and to the half tribe of manasseh keep therefore the words of this covenant and do them that ye may prosper in all that ye do ye stand this day all of you before the lord your god your captains of your tribes your elders and your officers with all the men of israel your little ones your wives and thy stranger that is in thy camp from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water that thou shouldest enter into covenant with the lord thy god and into his oath which the lord thy god maketh with thee this day that he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself and that he may be unto thee a god as he hath said unto thee and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers to abraham to isaac and to jacob neither with you only do i make this covenant and this oath but with him that standeth here with us this day before the lord our god and also with him that is not here with us this day for ye know how we have dwelt in the land of egypt and how we came through the nations which ye passed by and ye have seen their abominations and their idols wood and stone silver and gold which were among them lest there should be among you man or woman or family or tribe whose heart turneth away this day from the lord our god to go and serve the gods of these nations lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood and it come to pass when he heareth the words of this curse that he bless himself in his heart saying i shall have peace though i walk in the imagination of mine heart to add drunkenness to thirst the lord will not spare him but then the anger of the lord and his jealousy shall smoke against that man and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him and the lord shall blot out his name from under heaven and the lord shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of israel according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law so that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you and the stranger that shall come from a far land shall say when they see the plagues of that land and the sicknesses which the lord hath laid upon it and
