but when the congregation is to be gathered together ye shall blow but ye shall not sound an alarm and the sons of aaron the priests shall blow with the trumpets and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations and if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets and ye shall be remembered before the lord your god and ye shall be saved from your enemies also in the day of your gladness and in your solemn days and in the beginnings of your months ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings that they may be to you for a memorial before your god i am the lord your god and it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month in
