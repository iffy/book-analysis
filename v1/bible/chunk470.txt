saith the lord to me make thee bonds and yokes and put them upon thy neck and send them to the king of edom and to the king of moab and to the king of the ammonites and to the king of tyrus and to the king of zidon by the hand of the messengers which come to jerusalem unto zedekiah king of judah and command them to say unto their masters thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel thus shall ye say unto your masters i have made the earth the man and the beast that are upon the ground by my great power and by my outstretched arm and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me and now have i given all these lands into the hand of nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon my servant and the beasts of the field have i given him also to serve him and all nations shall serve him and his son and his sons son until the very time of his land come and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him and it shall come to pass that the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of babylon that nation will i punish saith the lord with the sword and with the famine and with the pestilence until i have consumed them by his hand therefore hearken not ye to your prophets nor to your diviners nor to your dreamers nor to your enchanters nor to your sorcerers which speak unto you saying ye shall not serve the king of babylon for they prophesy a lie unto you to remove you far from your land and that i should drive you out and ye should perish but the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of babylon and serve him those will i let remain still in their own land saith the lord and they shall till it and dwell therein i spake also to zedekiah king of judah according to all these words saying bring your necks under the yoke of the king of babylon and serve him and his people and live why will ye die thou and thy people by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence as the lord hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of babylon therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you saying ye shall not serve the king of babylon for they prophesy a lie unto you for i have not sent them saith the lord yet they prophesy a lie in my name that i might drive you out and that ye might perish ye and the prophets that prophesy unto you also i spake to the priests and to all this people saying thus saith the lord hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you saying behold the vessels of the lords house shall now shortly be brought again from babylon for they prophesy a lie unto you hearken not unto them serve the king of babylon and live wherefore should this city be laid waste but if they be prophets and if the word of the lord be with them let them now make intercession to the lord of hosts that the vessels which are left in the house of the lord and in the house of the king of judah and at jerusalem go not to babylon for thus saith the lord of hosts concerning the pillars and concerning the sea and concerning the bases and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city which nebuchadnezzar king of babylon took not when he carried away captive jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah from jerusalem to babylon and all the nobles of judah and jerusalem yea thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the lord and in the house of the king of judah and of jerusalem they shall be carried to babylon and there shall they be until the day that i visit them saith the lord then will i bring them up and restore them to this place and it came to pass the same year in the beginning of the reign of zedekiah king of judah in the fourth year and in the fifth month that hananiah the son of azur the prophet which was of gibeon spake unto me in the house of the lord in the presence of the priests and of all the people saying thus speaketh the lord of hosts the god of israel saying i have broken the yoke of the king of babylon within two full years will i bring again into this place all the vessels of the lords house that nebuchadnezzar king of babylon took away from this place and carried them to babylon and i will bring again to this place jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah with all the captives of judah that went into babylon saith the lord for i will break the yoke of the king of babylon then the prophet jeremiah said unto the prophet hananiah in the presence of the priests and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the lord even the prophet jeremiah said amen the lord do so the lord perform thy words which thou hast prophesied to bring again the vessels of the lords house and all that is carried away captive from babylon into this place nevertheless hear thou now this word that i speak in thine ears and in the ears of all the people the prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries and against great kingdoms of war and of evil and of pestilence the prophet which prophesieth of peace when the word of the prophet shall come to pass then shall the prophet be known that the lord hath truly sent him then hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet jeremiahs neck and brake it and hananiah spake in the presence of all the people saying
