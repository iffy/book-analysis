call for one simon whose surname is peter he lodgeth with one simon a tanner whose house is by the sea side he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do and when the angel which spake unto cornelius was departed he called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually and when he had declared all these things unto them he sent them to joppa on the morrow as they went on their journey and drew nigh unto the city peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour and he became very hungry and would have eaten but while they made ready he fell into a trance and saw heaven opened and a certain vessel descending upon him as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners and let down to the earth wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and fowls of the air and there came a voice to him rise peter kill and eat but peter said not so lord for i have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean and the voice spake unto him again the second time what god hath cleansed that call not thou common this was done thrice and the vessel was received up again into heaven now while peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean behold the men which were sent from cornelius had made enquiry for simons house and stood before the gate and called and asked whether simon which was surnamed peter were lodged there while peter thought on the vision the spirit said unto him behold three men seek thee arise therefore and get thee down and go with them doubting nothing for i have sent them then peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from cornelius and said behold i am he whom ye seek what is the cause wherefore ye are come and they said cornelius the centurion a just man and one that feareth god and of good report among all the nation of the jews was warned from god by an holy angel to send for thee into his house and to hear words of thee then called he them in and lodged them and on the morrow peter went away with them and certain brethren from joppa accompanied him and the morrow after they entered into caesarea and cornelius waited for them and he had called together his kinsmen and near friends and as peter was coming in cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshipped him but peter took him up saying stand up i myself also am a man and as he talked with him he went in and found many that were come together and he said unto them ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a jew to keep company or come unto one of another nation but god hath shewed me that i should not call any man common or unclean therefore came i unto you without gainsaying as soon as i was sent for i ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me and cornelius said four days ago i was fasting until this hour and at the ninth hour i prayed in my house and behold a man stood before me in bright clothing and said cornelius thy prayer is heard and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of god send therefore to joppa and call hither simon whose surname is peter he is lodged in the house of one simon a tanner by the sea side who when he cometh shall speak unto thee immediately therefore i sent to thee and thou hast well done that thou art come now therefore are we all here present before god to hear all things that are commanded thee of god then peter opened his mouth and said of a truth i perceive that god is no respecter of persons but in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him the word which god sent unto the children of israel preaching peace by jesus christ he is lord of all that word i say ye know which was published throughout all judaea and began from galilee after the baptism which john preached how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for god was with him and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the jews and in jerusalem whom they slew and hanged on a tree him god raised up the third day and shewed him openly not to all the people but unto witnesses chosen before god even to us who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead and he commanded us to preach unto the people and to testify that it is he which was ordained of god to be the judge of quick and dead to him give all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins while peter yet spake these words the holy ghost fell on all them which heard the word and they of the circumcision which believed were astonished as many as came with peter because that on the gentiles also was poured out the gift of the holy ghost for they heard them speak with tongues and magnify god then answered peter can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized which have received the holy ghost as well as we and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the lord then prayed they him to tarry certain days and the apostles and brethren that were in judaea heard that the gentiles had also received the word of god and when peter was come up to jerusalem they that were of the circumcision contended with him saying thou wentest in to men
