eat and were well filled for he gave them their own desire they were not estranged from their lust but while their meat was yet in their mouths the wrath of god came upon them and slew the fattest of them and smote down the chosen men of israel for all this they sinned still and believed not for his wondrous works therefore their days did he consume in vanity and their years in trouble when he slew them then they sought him and they returned and enquired early after god and they remembered that god was their rock and the high god their redeemer nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth and they lied unto him with their tongues for their heart was not right with him neither were they stedfast in his covenant but he being full of compassion forgave their iniquity and destroyed them not yea many a time turned he his anger away and did not stir up all his wrath for he remembered that they were but flesh a wind that passeth away and cometh not again how oft did they provoke him in the wilderness and grieve him in the desert yea they turned back and tempted god and limited the holy one of israel they remembered not his hand nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy how he had wrought his signs in egypt and his wonders in the field of zoan and had turned their rivers into blood and their floods that they could not drink he sent divers sorts of flies among them which devoured them and frogs which destroyed them he gave also their increase unto the caterpiller and their labour unto the locust he destroyed their vines with hail and their sycomore trees with frost he gave up their cattle also to the hail and their flocks to hot thunderbolts he cast upon them the fierceness of his anger wrath and indignation and trouble by sending evil angels among them he made a way to his anger he spared not their soul from death but gave their life over to the pestilence and smote all the firstborn in egypt the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of ham but made his own people to go forth like sheep and guided them in the wilderness like a flock and he led them on safely so that they feared not but the sea overwhelmed their enemies and he brought them to the border of his sanctuary even to this mountain which his right hand had purchased he cast out the heathen also before them and divided them an inheritance by line and made the tribes of israel to dwell in their tents yet they tempted and provoked the most high god and kept not his testimonies but turned back and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers they were turned aside like a deceitful bow for they provoked him to anger with their high places and moved him to jealousy with their graven images when god heard this he was wroth and greatly abhorred israel so that he forsook the tabernacle of shiloh the tent which he placed among men and delivered his strength into captivity and his glory into the enemys hand he gave his people over also unto the sword and was wroth with his inheritance the fire consumed their young men and their maidens were not given to marriage their priests fell by the sword and their widows made no lamentation then the lord awaked as one out of sleep and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine and he smote his enemies in the hinder parts he put them to a perpetual reproach moreover he refused the tabernacle of joseph and chose not the tribe of ephraim but chose the tribe of judah the mount zion which he loved and he built his sanctuary like high palaces like the earth which he hath established for ever he chose david also his servant and took him from the sheepfolds from following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed jacob his people and israel his inheritance so he fed them according to the integrity of his heart and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands o god the heathen are come into thine inheritance thy holy temple have they defiled they have laid jerusalem on heaps the dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth their blood have they shed like water round about jerusalem and there was none to bury them we are become a reproach to our neighbours a scorn and derision to them that are round about us how long lord wilt thou be angry for ever shall thy jealousy burn like fire pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name for they have devoured jacob and laid waste his dwelling place o remember not against us former iniquities let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us for we are brought very low help us o god of our salvation for the glory of thy name and deliver us and purge away our sins for thy names sake wherefore should the heathen say where is their god let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die and render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach wherewith they have reproached thee o lord so we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever we will shew forth thy praise to all generations give ear o shepherd of israel thou that leadest joseph like a flock thou that dwellest between the cherubims shine forth before ephraim and benjamin and manasseh stir up thy strength and come and save us turn us again o god and cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved o lord god of hosts how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people thou feedest them with the bread
