answered them after the advice of the young men saying my father made your yoke heavy but i will add thereto my father chastised you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions so the king hearkened not unto the people for the cause was of god that the lord might perform his word which he spake by the hand of ahijah the shilonite to jeroboam the son of nebat and when all israel saw that the king would not hearken unto them the people answered the king saying what portion have we in david and we have none inheritance in the son of jesse every man to your tents o israel and now david see to thine own house so all israel went to their tents but as for the children of israel that dwelt in the cities of judah rehoboam reigned over them then king rehoboam sent hadoram that was over the tribute and the children of israel stoned him with stones that he died but king rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot to flee to jerusalem and israel rebelled against the house of david unto this day and when rehoboam was come to jerusalem he gathered of the house of judah and benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men which were warriors to fight against israel that he might bring the kingdom again to rehoboam but the word of the lord came to shemaiah the man of god saying speak unto rehoboam the son of solomon king of judah and to all israel in judah and benjamin saying thus saith the lord ye shall not go up nor fight against your brethren return every man to his house for this thing is done of me and they obeyed the words of the lord and returned from going against jeroboam and rehoboam dwelt in jerusalem and built cities for defence in judah he built even bethlehem and etam and tekoa and bethzur and shoco and adullam and gath and mareshah and ziph and adoraim and lachish and azekah and zorah and aijalon and hebron which are in judah and in benjamin fenced cities and he fortified the strong holds and put captains in them and store of victual and of oil and wine and in every several city he put shields and spears and made them exceeding strong having judah and benjamin on his side and the priests and the levites that were in all israel resorted to him out of all their coasts for the levites left their suburbs and their possession and came to judah and jerusalem for jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priests office unto the lord and he ordained him priests for the high places and for the devils and for the calves which he had made and after them out of all the tribes of israel such as set their hearts to seek the lord god of israel came to jerusalem to sacrifice unto the lord god of their fathers so they strengthened the kingdom of judah and made rehoboam the son of solomon strong three years for three years they walked in the way of david and solomon and rehoboam took him mahalath the daughter of jerimoth the son of david to wife and abihail the daughter of eliab the son of jesse which bare him children jeush and shamariah and zaham and after her he took maachah the daughter of absalom which bare him abijah and attai and ziza and shelomith and rehoboam loved maachah the daughter of absalom above all his wives and his concubines for he took eighteen wives and threescore concubines and begat twenty and eight sons and threescore daughters and rehoboam made abijah the son of maachah the chief to be ruler among his brethren for he thought to make him king and he dealt wisely and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of judah and benjamin unto every fenced city and he gave them victual in abundance and he desired many wives and it came to pass when rehoboam had established the kingdom and had strengthened himself he forsook the law of the lord and all israel with him and it came to pass that in the fifth year of king rehoboam shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem because they had transgressed against the lord with twelve hundred chariots and threescore thousand horsemen and the people were without number that came with him out of egypt the lubims the sukkiims and the ethiopians and he took the fenced cities which pertained to judah and came to jerusalem then came shemaiah the prophet to rehoboam and to the princes of judah that were gathered together to jerusalem because of shishak and said unto them thus saith the lord ye have forsaken me and therefore have i also left you in the hand of shishak whereupon the princes of israel and the king humbled themselves and they said the lord is righteous and when the lord saw that they humbled themselves the word of the lord came to shemaiah saying they have humbled themselves therefore i will not destroy them but i will grant them some deliverance and my wrath shall not be poured out upon jerusalem by the hand of shishak nevertheless they shall be his servants that they may know my service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries so shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem and took away the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the kings house he took all he carried away also the shields of gold which solomon had made instead of which king rehoboam made shields of brass and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard that kept the entrance of the kings house and when the king entered into the house of the lord the guard came and fetched them and brought them again into the guard chamber and when he humbled himself the wrath of the lord turned from him that he would not destroy him altogether and also in judah things
