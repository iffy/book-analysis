the lord and this shall be a sign unto you ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising god and saying glory to god in the highest and on earth peace good will toward men and it came to pass as the angels were gone away from them into heaven the shepherds said one to another let us now go even unto bethlehem and see this thing which is come to pass which the lord hath made known unto us and they came with haste and found mary and joseph and the babe lying in a manger and when they had seen it they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds but mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart and the shepherds returned glorifying and praising god for all the things that they had heard and seen as it was told unto them and when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child his name was called jesus which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb and when the days of her purification according to the law of moses were accomplished they brought him to jerusalem to present him to the lord as it is written in the law of the lord every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the lord and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the lord a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons and behold there was a man in jerusalem whose name was simeon and the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of israel and the holy ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the lords christ and he came by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the child jesus to do for him after the custom of the law then took he him up in his arms and blessed god and said lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace according to thy word for mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou hast prepared before the face of all people a light to lighten the gentiles and the glory of thy people israel and joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him and simeon blessed them and said unto mary his mother behold this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in israel and for a sign which shall be spoken against yea a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed and there was one anna a prophetess the daughter of phanuel of the tribe of aser she was of a great age and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity and she was a widow of about fourscore and four years which departed not from the temple but served god with fastings and prayers night and day and she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the lord and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in jerusalem and when they had performed all things according to the law of the lord they returned into galilee to their own city nazareth and the child grew and waxed strong in spirit filled with wisdom and the grace of god was upon him now his parents went to jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover and when he was twelve years old they went up to jerusalem after the custom of the feast and when they had fulfilled the days as they returned the child jesus tarried behind in jerusalem and joseph and his mother knew not of it but they supposing him to have been in the company went a days journey and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance and when they found him not they turned back again to jerusalem seeking him and it came to pass that after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questions and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him son why hast thou thus dealt with us behold thy father and i have sought thee sorrowing and he said unto them how is it that ye sought me wist ye not that i must be about my fathers business and they understood not the saying which he spake unto them and he went down with them and came to nazareth and was subject unto them but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart and jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favour with god and man now in the fifteenth year of the reign of tiberius caesar pontius pilate being governor of judaea and herod being tetrarch of galilee and his brother philip tetrarch of ituraea and of the region of trachonitis and lysanias the tetrarch of abilene annas and caiaphas being the high priests the word of god came unto john the son of zacharias in the wilderness and he came into all the country about jordan preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins as it is written in the book of the words of esaias the prophet saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his paths straight every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be brought low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough ways shall be made smooth and all flesh shall see the salvation of god then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him o generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance and begin not to say within yourselves we have abraham
