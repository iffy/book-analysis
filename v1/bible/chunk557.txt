thy land and throw down all thy strong holds and i will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand and thou shalt have no more soothsayers thy graven images also will i cut off and thy standing images out of the midst of thee and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands and i will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee so will i destroy thy cities and i will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen such as they have not heard hear ye now what the lord saith arise contend thou before the mountains and let the hills hear thy voice hear ye o mountains the lords controversy and ye strong foundations of the earth for the lord hath a controversy with his people and he will plead with israel o my people what have i done unto thee and wherein have i wearied thee testify against me for i brought thee up out of the land of egypt and redeemed thee out of the house of servants and i sent before thee moses aaron and miriam o my people remember now what balak king of moab consulted and what balaam the son of beor answered him from shittim unto gilgal that ye may know the righteousness of the lord wherewith shall i come before the lord and bow myself before the high god shall i come before him with burnt offerings with calves of a year old will the lord be pleased with thousands of rams or with ten thousands of rivers of oil shall i give my firstborn for my transgression the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul he hath shewed thee o man what is good and what doth the lord require of thee but to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy god the lords voice crieth unto the city and the man of wisdom shall see thy name hear ye the rod and who hath appointed it are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked and the scant measure that is abominable shall i count them pure with the wicked balances and with the bag of deceitful weights for the rich men thereof are full of violence and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth therefore also will i make thee sick in smiting thee in making thee desolate because of thy sins thou shalt eat but not be satisfied and thy casting down shall be in the midst of thee and thou shalt take hold but shalt not deliver and that which thou deliverest will i give up to the sword thou shalt sow but thou shalt not reap thou shalt tread the olives but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil and sweet wine but shalt not drink wine for the statutes of omri are kept and all the works of the house of ahab and ye walk in their counsels that i should make thee a desolation and the inhabitants thereof an hissing therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people woe is me for i am as when they have gathered the summer fruits as the grapegleanings of the vintage there is no cluster to eat my soul desired the firstripe fruit the good man is perished out of the earth and there is none upright among men they all lie in wait for blood they hunt every man his brother with a net that they may do evil with both hands earnestly the prince asketh and the judge asketh for a reward and the great man he uttereth his mischievous desire so they wrap it up the best of them is as a brier the most upright is sharper than a thorn hedge the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation cometh now shall be their perplexity trust ye not in a friend put ye not confidence in a guide keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom for the son dishonoureth the father the daughter riseth up against her mother the daughter in law against her mother in law a mans enemies are the men of his own house therefore i will look unto the lord i will wait for the god of my salvation my god will hear me rejoice not against me o mine enemy when i fall i shall arise when i sit in darkness the lord shall be a light unto me i will bear the indignation of the lord because i have sinned against him until he plead my cause and execute judgment for me he will bring me forth to the light and i shall behold his righteousness then she that is mine enemy shall see it and shame shall cover her which said unto me where is the lord thy god mine eyes shall behold her now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets in the day that thy walls are to be built in that day shall the decree be far removed in that day also he shall come even to thee from assyria and from the fortified cities and from the fortress even to the river and from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein for the fruit of their doings feed thy people with thy rod the flock of thine heritage which dwell solitarily in the wood in the midst of carmel let them feed in bashan and gilead as in the days of old according to the days of thy coming out of the land of egypt will i shew unto him marvellous things the nations shall see and be confounded at all their might they shall lay their hand upon their mouth their ears shall be deaf they shall lick the dust like a serpent they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth they shall be afraid of the lord our god and shall fear because of thee who is a god like unto thee that pardoneth iniquity and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage he retaineth not his anger for ever because he delighteth in mercy he will turn again he
