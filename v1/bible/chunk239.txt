jeroboam the son of nebat an ephrathite of zereda solomons servant whose mothers name was zeruah a widow woman even he lifted up his hand against the king and this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king solomon built millo and repaired the breaches of the city of david his father and the man jeroboam was a mighty man of valour and solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of joseph and it came to pass at that time when jeroboam went out of jerusalem that the prophet ahijah the shilonite found him in the way and he had clad himself with a new garment and they two were alone in the field and ahijah caught the new garment that was on him and rent it in twelve pieces and he said to jeroboam take thee ten pieces for thus saith the lord the god of israel behold i will rend the kingdom out of the hand of solomon and will give ten tribes to thee but he shall have one tribe for my servant davids sake and for jerusalems sake the city which i have chosen out of all the tribes of israel because that they have forsaken me and have worshipped ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians chemosh the god of the moabites and milcom the god of the children of ammon and have not walked in my ways to do that which is right in mine eyes and to keep my statutes and my judgments as did david his father howbeit i will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand but i will make him prince all the days of his life for david my servants sake whom i chose because he kept my commandments and my statutes but i will take the kingdom out of his sons hand and will give it unto thee even ten tribes and unto his son will i give one tribe that david my servant may have a light alway before me in jerusalem the city which i have chosen me to put my name there and i will take thee and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth and shalt be king over israel and it shall be if thou wilt hearken unto all that i command thee and wilt walk in my ways and do that is right in my sight to keep my statutes and my commandments as david my servant did that i will be with thee and build thee a sure house as i built for david and will give israel unto thee and i will for this afflict the seed of david but not for ever solomon sought therefore to kill jeroboam and jeroboam arose and fled into egypt unto shishak king of egypt and was in egypt until the death of solomon and the rest of the acts of solomon and all that he did and his wisdom are they not written in the book of the acts of solomon and the time that solomon reigned in jerusalem over all israel was forty years and solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of david his father and rehoboam his son reigned in his stead and rehoboam went to shechem for all israel were come to shechem to make him king and it came to pass when jeroboam the son of nebat who was yet in egypt heard of it for he was fled from the presence of king solomon and jeroboam dwelt in egypt that they sent and called him and jeroboam and all the congregation of israel came and spake unto rehoboam saying thy father made our yoke grievous now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father and his heavy yoke which he put upon us lighter and we will serve thee and he said unto them depart yet for three days then come again to me and the people departed and king rehoboam consulted with the old men that stood before solomon his father while he yet lived and said how do ye advise that i may answer this people and they spake unto him saying if thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day and wilt serve them and answer them and speak good words to them then they will be thy servants for ever but he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him and which stood before him and he said unto them what counsel give ye that we may answer this people who have spoken to me saying make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter and the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him saying thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee saying thy father made our yoke heavy but make thou it lighter unto us thus shalt thou say unto them my little finger shall be thicker than my fathers loins and now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke i will add to your yoke my father hath chastised you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions so jeroboam and all the people came to rehoboam the third day as the king had appointed saying come to me again the third day and the king answered the people roughly and forsook the old mens counsel that they gave him and spake to them after the counsel of the young men saying my father made your yoke heavy and i will add to your yoke my father also chastised you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people for the cause was from the lord that he might perform his saying which the lord spake by ahijah the shilonite unto jeroboam the son of nebat so when all israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them the people answered the king saying what portion have we in david neither have we inheritance in the son of jesse to your tents o israel now see to thine own house david so israel departed unto their tents but as for the children of
