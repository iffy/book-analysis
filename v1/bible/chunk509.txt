have said it the word of the lord came unto me again saying also thou son of man appoint thee two ways that the sword of the king of babylon may come both twain shall come forth out of one land and choose thou a place choose it at the head of the way to the city appoint a way that the sword may come to rabbath of the ammonites and to judah in jerusalem the defenced for the king of babylon stood at the parting of the way at the head of the two ways to use divination he made his arrows bright he consulted with images he looked in the liver at his right hand was the divination for jerusalem to appoint captains to open the mouth in the slaughter to lift up the voice with shouting to appoint battering rams against the gates to cast a mount and to build a fort and it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight to them that have sworn oaths but he will call to remembrance the iniquity that they may be taken therefore thus saith the lord god because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered in that your transgressions are discovered so that in all your doings your sins do appear because i say that ye are come to remembrance ye shall be taken with the hand and thou profane wicked prince of israel whose day is come when iniquity shall have an end thus saith the lord god remove the diadem and take off the crown this shall not be the same exalt him that is low and abase him that is high i will overturn overturn overturn it and it shall be no more until he come whose right it is and i will give it him and thou son of man prophesy and say thus saith the lord god concerning the ammonites and concerning their reproach even say thou the sword the sword is drawn for the slaughter it is furbished to consume because of the glittering whiles they see vanity unto thee whiles they divine a lie unto thee to bring thee upon the necks of them that are slain of the wicked whose day is come when their iniquity shall have an end shall i cause it to return into his sheath i will judge thee in the place where thou wast created in the land of thy nativity and i will pour out mine indignation upon thee i will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men and skilful to destroy thou shalt be for fuel to the fire thy blood shall be in the midst of the land thou shalt be no more remembered for i the lord have spoken it moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying now thou son of man wilt thou judge wilt thou judge the bloody city yea thou shalt shew her all her abominations then say thou thus saith the lord god the city sheddeth blood in the midst of it that her time may come and maketh idols against herself to defile herself thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made and thou hast caused thy days to draw near and art come even unto thy years therefore have i made thee a reproach unto the heathen and a mocking to all countries those that be near and those that be far from thee shall mock thee which art infamous and much vexed behold the princes of israel every one were in thee to their power to shed blood in thee have they set light by father and mother in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow thou hast despised mine holy things and hast profaned my sabbaths in thee are men that carry tales to shed blood and in thee they eat upon the mountains in the midst of thee they commit lewdness in thee have they discovered their fathers nakedness in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution and one hath committed abomination with his neighbours wife and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law and another in thee hath humbled his sister his fathers daughter in thee have they taken gifts to shed blood thou hast taken usury and increase and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion and hast forgotten me saith the lord god behold therefore i have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee can thine heart endure or can thine hands be strong in the days that i shall deal with thee i the lord have spoken it and will do it and i will scatter thee among the heathen and disperse thee in the countries and will consume thy filthiness out of thee and thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen and thou shalt know that i am the lord and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man the house of israel is to me become dross all they are brass and tin and iron and lead in the midst of the furnace they are even the dross of silver therefore thus saith the lord god because ye are all become dross behold therefore i will gather you into the midst of jerusalem as they gather silver and brass and iron and lead and tin into the midst of the furnace to blow the fire upon it to melt it so will i gather you in mine anger and in my fury and i will leave you there and melt you yea i will gather you and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath and ye shall be melted in the midst therof as silver is melted in the midst of the furnace so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof and ye shall know that i the lord have poured out my fury upon you and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man say
