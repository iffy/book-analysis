that is near shall fall by the sword and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine thus will i accomplish my fury upon them then shall ye know that i am the lord when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars upon every high hill in all the tops of the mountains and under every green tree and under every thick oak the place where they did offer sweet savour to all their idols so will i stretch out my hand upon them and make the land desolate yea more desolate than the wilderness toward diblath in all their habitations and they shall know that i am the lord moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying also thou son of man thus saith the lord god unto the land of israel an end the end is come upon the four corners of the land now is the end come upon thee and i will send mine anger upon thee and will judge thee according to thy ways and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations and mine eye shall not spare thee neither will i have pity but i will recompense thy ways upon thee and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee and ye shall know that i am the lord thus saith the lord god an evil an only evil behold is come an end is come the end is come it watcheth for thee behold it is come the morning is come unto thee o thou that dwellest in the land the time is come the day of trouble is near and not the sounding again of the mountains now will i shortly pour out my fury upon thee and accomplish mine anger upon thee and i will judge thee according to thy ways and will recompense thee for all thine abominations and mine eye shall not spare neither will i have pity i will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations that are in the midst of thee and ye shall know that i am the lord that smiteth behold the day behold it is come the morning is gone forth the rod hath blossomed pride hath budded violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness none of them shall remain nor of their multitude nor of any of theirs neither shall there be wailing for them the time is come the day draweth near let not the buyer rejoice nor the seller mourn for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof for the seller shall not return to that which is sold although they were yet alive for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof which shall not return neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life they have blown the trumpet even to make all ready but none goeth to the battle for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof the sword is without and the pestilence and the famine within he that is in the field shall die with the sword and he that is in the city famine and pestilence shall devour him but they that escape of them shall escape and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys all of them mourning every one for his iniquity all hands shall be feeble and all knees shall be weak as water they shall also gird themselves with sackcloth and horror shall cover them and shame shall be upon all faces and baldness upon all their heads they shall cast their silver in the streets and their gold shall be removed their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the lord they shall not satisfy their souls neither fill their bowels because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity as for the beauty of his ornament he set it in
