dust upon their heads they shall wallow themselves in the ashes and they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee and gird them with sackcloth and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart and bitter wailing and in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee and lament over thee saying what city is like tyrus like the destroyed in the midst of the sea when thy wares went forth out of the seas thou filledst many people thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise in the time when thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters thy merchandise and all thy company in the midst of thee shall fall all the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee and their kings shall be sore afraid they

riches and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures by thy great wisdom and by thy traffick hast thou increased thy riches and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches therefore thus saith the lord god because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of god behold therefore i will bring strangers upon thee the terrible of the nations and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom and they shall defile thy brightness they shall bring thee down to the pit and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas wilt thou yet say before him that
