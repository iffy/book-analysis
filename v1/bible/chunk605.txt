man if he had never been born and as they did eat jesus took bread and blessed and brake it and gave to them and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and when he had given thanks he gave it to them and they all drank of it and he said unto them this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many verily i say unto you i will drink no more of the fruit of the vine until that day that i drink it new in the kingdom of god and when they had sung an hymn they went out into the mount of olives and jesus saith unto them all ye shall be offended because of me this night for it is written i will smite the shepherd and the sheep shall be scattered but after that i am risen i will go before you into galilee but peter said unto him although all shall be offended yet will not i and jesus saith unto him verily i say unto thee that this day even in this night before the cock crow twice thou shalt deny me thrice but he spake the more vehemently if i should die with thee i will not deny thee in any wise likewise also said they all and they came to a place which was named gethsemane and he saith to his disciples sit ye here while i shall pray and he taketh with him peter and james and john and began to be sore amazed and to be very heavy and saith unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death tarry ye here and watch and he went forward a little and fell on the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him and he said abba father all things are possible unto thee take away this cup from me nevertheless not what i will but what thou wilt and he cometh and findeth them sleeping and saith unto peter simon sleepest thou couldest not thou watch one hour watch ye and pray lest ye enter into temptation the spirit truly is ready but the flesh is weak and again he went away and prayed and spake the same words and when he returned he found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy neither wist they what to answer him and he cometh the third time and saith unto them sleep on now and take your rest it is enough the hour is come behold the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners rise up let us go lo he that betrayeth me is at hand and immediately while he yet spake cometh judas one of the twelve and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders and he that betrayed him had given them a token saying whomsoever i shall kiss that same is he take him and lead him away safely and as soon as he was come he goeth straightway to him and saith master master and kissed him and they laid their hands on him and took him and one of them that stood by drew a sword and smote a servant of the high priest and cut off his ear and jesus answered and said unto them are ye come out as against a thief with swords and with staves to take me i was daily with you in the temple teaching and ye took me not but the scriptures must be fulfilled and they all forsook him and fled and there followed him a certain young man having a linen cloth cast about his naked body and the young men laid hold on him and he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked and they led jesus away to the high priest and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes and peter followed him afar off even into the palace of the high priest and he sat with the servants and warmed himself at the fire and the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against jesus to put him to death and found none for many bare false witness against him but their witness agreed not together and there arose certain and bare false witness against him saying we heard him say i will destroy this temple that is made with hands and within three days i will build another made without hands but neither so did their witness agree together and the high priest stood up in the midst and asked jesus saying answerest thou nothing what is it which these witness against thee but he held his peace and answered nothing again the high priest asked him and said unto him art thou the christ the son of the blessed and jesus said i am and ye shall see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven then the high priest rent his clothes and saith what need we any further witnesses ye have heard the blasphemy what think ye and they all condemned him to be guilty of death and some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to buffet him and to say unto him prophesy and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands and as peter was beneath in the palace there cometh one of the maids of the high priest and when she saw peter warming himself she looked upon him and said and thou also wast with jesus of nazareth but he denied saying i know not neither understand i what thou sayest and he went out into the porch and the cock crew and a maid saw him again and began to say to them that stood by this is one of them and he denied it again and a little after they that stood by said again to peter surely thou art one of them for thou art a galilaean and thy speech agreeth thereto but he began to curse and to swear saying i know not this man of whom ye speak and the second time the cock crew and peter
