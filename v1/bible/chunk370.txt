in his wrath the righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked so that a man shall say verily there is a reward for the righteous verily he is a god that judgeth in the earth deliver me from mine enemies o my god defend me from them that rise up against me deliver me from the workers of iniquity and save me from bloody men for lo they lie in wait for my soul the mighty are gathered against me not for my transgression nor for my sin o lord they run and prepare themselves without my fault awake to help me and behold thou therefore o lord god of hosts the god of israel awake to visit all the heathen be not merciful to any wicked transgressors selah they return at evening they make a noise like a dog and go round about the city behold they belch out with their mouth swords are in their lips for who say they doth hear but thou o lord shalt laugh at them thou shalt have all the heathen in derision because of his strength will i wait upon thee for god is my defence the god of my mercy shall prevent me god shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies slay them not lest my people forget scatter them by thy power and bring them down o lord our shield for the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride and for cursing and lying which they speak consume them in wrath consume them that they may not be and let them know that god ruleth in jacob unto the ends of the earth selah and at evening let them return and let them make a noise like a dog and go round about the city let them wander up and down for meat and grudge if they be not satisfied but i will sing of thy power yea i will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble unto thee o my strength will i sing for god is my defence and the god of my mercy o god thou hast cast us off thou hast scattered us thou hast been displeased o turn thyself to us again thou hast made the earth to tremble thou hast broken it heal the breaches thereof for it shaketh thou hast shewed thy people hard things thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee that it may be displayed because of the truth selah that thy beloved may be delivered save with thy right hand and hear me god hath spoken in his holiness i will rejoice i will divide shechem and mete out the valley of succoth gilead is mine and manasseh is mine ephraim also is the strength of mine head judah is my lawgiver moab is my washpot over edom will i cast out my shoe philistia triumph thou because of me who will bring me into the strong city who will lead me into edom wilt not thou o god which hadst cast us off and thou o god which didst not go out with our armies give us help from trouble for vain is the help of man through god we shall do valiantly for he it is that shall tread down our enemies hear my cry o god attend unto my prayer from the end of the earth will i cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than i for thou hast been a shelter for me and a strong tower from the enemy i will abide in thy tabernacle for ever i will trust in the covert of thy wings selah for thou o god hast heard my vows thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name thou wilt prolong the kings life and his years as many generations he shall abide before god for ever o prepare mercy and truth which may preserve him so will i sing praise unto thy name for ever that i may daily perform my vows truly my soul waiteth upon god from him cometh my salvation he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defence i shall not be greatly moved how long will ye imagine mischief against a man ye shall be slain all of you as a bowing wall shall ye be and as a tottering fence they only consult to cast him down from his excellency they delight in lies they bless with their mouth but they curse inwardly selah my soul wait thou only upon god for my expectation is from him he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defence i shall not be moved in god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god trust in him at all times ye people pour out your heart before him god is a refuge for us selah surely men of low degree are vanity and men of high degree are a lie to be laid in the balance they are altogether lighter than vanity trust not in oppression and become not vain in robbery if riches increase set not your heart upon them god hath spoken once twice have i heard this that power belongeth unto god also unto thee o lord belongeth mercy for thou renderest to every man according to his work o god thou art my god early will i seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is to see thy power and thy glory so as i have seen thee in the sanctuary because thy lovingkindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee thus will i bless thee while i live i will lift up my hands in thy name my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips when i remember thee upon my bed and meditate on thee in the night watches
