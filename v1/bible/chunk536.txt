make known to the king the interpretation thereof then was king belshazzar greatly troubled and his countenance was changed in him and his lords were astonied now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house and the queen spake and said o king live for ever let not thy thoughts trouble thee nor let thy countenance be changed there is a man in thy kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods was found in him whom the king nebuchadnezzar thy father the king i say thy father made master of the magicians astrologers chaldeans and soothsayers forasmuch as an excellent spirit and knowledge and understanding interpreting of dreams and shewing of hard sentences and dissolving of doubts were found in the same daniel whom the king named belteshazzar now let daniel be called and he will shew the interpretation then was daniel brought in before the king and the king spake and said unto daniel art thou that daniel which art of the children of the captivity of judah whom the king my father brought out of jewry i have even heard of thee that the spirit of the gods is in thee and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee and now the wise men the astrologers have been brought in before me that they should read this writing and make known unto me the interpretation thereof but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing and i have heard of thee that thou canst make interpretations and dissolve doubts now if thou canst read the writing and make known to me the interpretation thereof thou shalt be clothed with scarlet and have a chain of gold about thy neck and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom then daniel answered and said before the king let thy gifts be to thyself and give thy rewards to another yet i will read the writing unto the king and make known to him the interpretation o thou king the most high god gave nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom and majesty and glory and honour and for the majesty that he gave him all people nations and languages trembled and feared before him whom he would he slew and whom he would he kept alive and whom he would he set up and whom he would he put down but when his heart was lifted up and his mind hardened in pride he was deposed from his kingly throne and they took his glory from him and he was driven from the sons of men and his heart was made like the beasts and his dwelling was with the wild asses they fed him with grass like oxen and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till he knew that the most high god ruled in the kingdom of men and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will and thou his son o belshazzar hast not humbled thine heart though thou knewest all this but hast lifted up thyself against the lord of heaven and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee and thou and thy lords thy wives and thy concubines have drunk wine in them and thou hast praised the gods of silver and gold of brass iron wood and stone which see not nor hear nor know and the god in whose hand thy breath is and whose are all thy ways hast thou not glorified then was the part of the hand sent from him and this writing was written and this is the writing that was written mene mene tekel upharsin this is the interpretation of the thing mene god hath numbered thy kingdom and finished it tekel thou art weighed in the balances and art found wanting peres thy kingdom is divided and given to the medes and persians then commanded belshazzar and they clothed daniel with scarlet and put a chain of gold about his neck and made a proclamation concerning him that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom in that night was belshazzar the king of the chaldeans slain and darius the median took the kingdom being about threescore and two years old it pleased darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes which should be over the whole kingdom and over these three presidents of whom daniel was first that the princes might give accounts unto them and the king should have no damage then this daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes because an excellent spirit was in him and the king thought to set him over the whole realm then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against daniel concerning the kingdom but they could find none occasion nor fault forasmuch as he was faithful neither was there any error or fault found in him then said these men we shall not find any

shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days save of thee o king he shall be cast into the den of lions now o king establish the decree and sign the writing that it be not changed according to the law of the medes and persians which altereth not wherefore king darius signed the writing and the decree now when daniel knew that the writing was signed he went into his house and his windows being open in his chamber toward jerusalem he kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his god as he did aforetime then these men assembled and found daniel praying
