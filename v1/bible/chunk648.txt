this joseph of arimathaea being a disciple of jesus but secretly for fear of the jews besought pilate that he might take away the body of jesus and pilate gave him leave he came therefore and took the body of jesus and there came also nicodemus which at the first came to jesus by night and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes about an hundred pound weight then took they the body of jesus and wound it in linen clothes with the spices as the manner of the jews is to bury now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden and in the garden a new sepulchre wherein was never man yet laid there laid they jesus therefore because of the jews preparation day for the sepulchre was nigh at hand the first day of the week cometh mary magdalene early when it was yet dark unto the sepulchre and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre then she runneth and cometh to simon peter and to the other disciple whom jesus loved and saith unto them they have taken away the lord out of the sepulchre and we know not where they have laid him peter therefore went forth and that other disciple and came to the sepulchre so they ran both together and the other disciple did outrun peter and came first to the sepulchre and he stooping down and looking in saw the linen clothes lying yet went he not in then cometh simon peter following him and went into the sepulchre and seeth the linen clothes lie and the napkin that was about his head not lying with the linen clothes but wrapped together in a place by itself then went in also that other disciple which came first to the sepulchre and he saw and believed for as yet they knew not the scripture that he must rise again from the dead then the disciples went away again unto their own home but mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the sepulchre and seeth two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of jesus had lain and they say unto her woman why weepest thou she saith unto them because they have taken away my lord and i know not where they have laid him and when she had thus said she turned herself back and saw jesus standing and knew not that it was jesus jesus saith unto her woman why weepest thou whom seekest thou she supposing him to be the gardener saith unto him sir if thou have borne him hence tell me where thou hast laid him and i will take him away jesus saith unto her mary she turned herself and saith unto him rabboni which is to say master jesus saith unto her touch me not for i am not yet ascended to my father but go to my brethren and say unto them i ascend unto my father and your father and to my god and your god mary magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the lord and that he had spoken these things unto her then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews came jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them peace be unto you and when he had so said he shewed unto them his hands and his side then were the disciples glad when they saw the lord then said jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father hath sent me even so send i you and when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto them receive ye the holy ghost whose soever sins ye remit they are remitted unto them and whose soever sins ye retain they are retained but thomas one of the twelve called didymus was not with them when jesus came the other disciples therefore said unto him we have seen the lord but he said unto them except i shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his side i will not believe and after eight days again his disciples were within and thomas with them then came jesus the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said peace be unto you then saith he to thomas reach hither thy finger and behold my hands and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side and be not faithless but believing and thomas answered and said unto him my lord and my god jesus saith unto him thomas because thou hast seen me thou hast believed blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed and many other signs truly did jesus in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book but these are written that ye might believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that believing ye might have life through his name after these things jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of tiberias and on this wise shewed he himself there were together simon peter and thomas called didymus and nathanael of cana in galilee and the sons of zebedee and two other of his disciples simon peter saith unto them i go a fishing they say unto him we also go with thee they went forth and entered into a ship immediately and that night they caught nothing but when the morning was now come jesus stood on the shore but the disciples knew not that it was jesus then jesus saith unto them children have ye any meat they answered him no and he said unto them cast the net on the right side of the ship and ye shall find they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes therefore that disciple whom jesus loved saith unto peter it is the lord now when simon peter heard that it was the lord he girt his fishers coat unto him for
