integrity than he that is perverse in his lips and is a fool also that the soul be without knowledge it is not good and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth the foolishness of man perverteth his way and his heart fretteth against the lord wealth maketh many friends but the poor is separated from his neighbour a false witness shall not be unpunished and he that speaketh lies shall not escape many will intreat the favour of the prince and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts all the brethren of the poor do hate him how much more do his friends go far from him he pursueth them with words yet they are wanting to him he that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul he that keepeth understanding shall find good a false witness shall not be unpunished and he that speaketh lies shall perish delight is not seemly for a fool much less for a servant to have rule over princes the discretion of a man deferreth his anger and it is his glory to pass over a transgression the kings wrath is as the roaring of a lion but his favour is as dew upon the grass a foolish son is the calamity of his father and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping house and riches are the inheritance of fathers and a prudent wife is from the lord slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep and an idle soul shall suffer hunger he that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul but he that despiseth his ways shall die he that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the lord and that which he hath given will he pay him again chasten thy son while there is hope and let not thy soul spare for his crying a man of great wrath shall suffer punishment for if thou deliver him yet thou must do it again hear counsel and receive instruction that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end there are many devices in a mans heart nevertheless the counsel of the lord that shall stand the desire of a man is his kindness and a poor man is better than a liar the fear of the lord tendeth to life and he that hath it shall abide satisfied he shall not be visited with evil a slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again smite a scorner and the simple will beware and reprove one that hath understanding and he will understand knowledge he that wasteth his father and chaseth away his mother is a son that causeth shame and bringeth reproach cease my son to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge an ungodly witness scorneth judgment and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity judgments are prepared for scorners and stripes for the back of fools wine is a mocker strong drink is raging and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise the fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion whoso provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul it is an honour for a man to cease from strife but every fool will be meddling the sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold therefore shall he beg in harvest and have nothing counsel in the heart of man is like deep water but a man of understanding will draw it out most men will proclaim every one his own goodness but a faithful man who can find the just man walketh in his integrity his children are blessed after him a king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes who can say i have made my heart clean i am pure from my sin divers weights and divers measures both of them are alike abomination to the lord even a child is known by his doings whether his work be pure and whether it be right the hearing ear and the seeing eye the lord hath made even both of them love not sleep lest thou come to poverty open thine eyes and thou shalt be satisfied with bread it is naught it is naught saith the buyer but when he is gone his way then he boasteth there is gold and a multitude of rubies but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel take his garment that is surety for a stranger and take a pledge of him for a strange woman bread of deceit is sweet to a man but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel every purpose is established by counsel and with good advice make war he that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips whoso curseth his father or his mother his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness an inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning but the end thereof shall not be blessed say not thou i will recompense evil but wait on the lord and he shall save thee divers weights are an abomination unto the lord and a false balance is not good mans goings are of the lord how can a man then understand his own way it is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy and after vows to make enquiry a wise king scattereth the wicked and bringeth the wheel over them the spirit of man is the candle of the lord searching all the inward parts of the belly mercy and truth preserve the king and his throne is upholden by mercy the glory of young men is their strength and the beauty of old men is the grey head the blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil so do stripes the inward parts of the belly the kings heart is in the hand of the lord as the rivers of water he turneth it whithersoever he will every way of a man is right in his own eyes but the lord pondereth the hearts to do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the lord than sacrifice an high look and a proud heart and the plowing of the wicked is sin the thoughts of the diligent tend
