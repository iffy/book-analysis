egyptians shall see thee that they shall say this is his wife and they will kill me but they will save thee alive say i pray thee thou art my sister that it may be well with me for thy sake and my soul shall live because of thee and it came to pass that when abram was come into egypt the egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair the princes also of pharaoh saw her and commended her before pharaoh and the woman was taken into pharaohs house and he entreated abram well for her sake and he had sheep and oxen and he asses and menservants and maidservants and she asses and camels and the lord plagued pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of sarai abrams wife and pharaoh called abram and said what is this that thou hast done unto me why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife why saidst thou she is my sister so i might have taken her to me to wife now therefore behold thy wife take her and go thy way and pharaoh commanded his men concerning him and they sent him away and his wife and all that he had and abram went up out of egypt he and his wife and all that he had and lot with him into the south and abram was very rich in cattle in silver and in gold and he went on his journeys from the south even to bethel unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning between bethel and hai unto the place of the altar which he had made there at the first and there abram called on the name of the lord and lot also which went with abram had flocks and herds and tents and the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together and there was a strife between the herdmen of abrams cattle and the herdmen of lots cattle and the canaanite and the perizzite dwelled then in the land and abram said unto lot let there be no strife i pray thee between me and thee and between my herdmen and thy herdmen for we be brethren is not the whole land before thee separate thyself i pray thee from me if thou wilt take the left hand then i will go to the right or if thou depart to the right hand then i will go to the left and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of jordan that it was well watered every where before the lord destroyed sodom and gomorrah even as the garden of the lord like the land of egypt as thou comest unto zoar then lot chose him all the plain of jordan and lot journeyed east and they separated themselves the one from the other abram dwelled in the land of canaan and lot dwelled in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent toward sodom but the men of sodom were wicked and sinners before the lord exceedingly and the lord said unto abram after that lot was separated from him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward and southward and eastward and westward for all the land which thou seest to thee will i give it and to thy seed for ever and i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered arise walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it for i will give it unto thee then abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plain of mamre which is in hebron and built there an altar unto the lord and it came to pass in the days of amraphel king of shinar arioch king of ellasar chedorlaomer king of elam and tidal king of nations that these made war with bera king of sodom and with birsha king of gomorrah shinab king of admah and shemeber king of zeboiim and the king of bela which is zoar all these were joined together in the vale of siddim which is the salt sea twelve years they served chedorlaomer and in the thirteenth year they rebelled and in the fourteenth year came chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him and smote the rephaims in ashteroth karnaim and the zuzims in ham and the emins in shaveh kiriathaim and the horites in their mount seir unto elparan which is by the wilderness and they returned and came to enmishpat which is kadesh and smote all the country of the amalekites and also the amorites that dwelt in hazezontamar and there went out the king of sodom and the king of gomorrah and the king of admah and the king of zeboiim and the king of bela the same is zoar and they joined battle with them in the vale of siddim with chedorlaomer the king of elam and with tidal king of nations and amraphel king of shinar and arioch king of ellasar four kings with five and the vale of siddim was full of slimepits and the kings of sodom and gomorrah fled and fell there and they that remained fled to the mountain and they took all the goods of sodom and gomorrah and all their victuals and went their way and they took lot abrams brothers son who dwelt in sodom and his goods and departed and there came one that had escaped and told abram the hebrew for he dwelt in the plain of mamre the amorite brother of eshcol and brother of aner and these were confederate with abram and when abram heard that his brother was taken captive he armed his trained servants born in his own house three hundred and eighteen and pursued them unto dan and he divided himself against them he and his servants by night and smote them and pursued them unto hobah which is on the left hand of damascus and he brought back all the goods and also brought again his brother lot and his goods and the women also and the people and
