until the even and if any man lie with her at all and her flowers be upon him he shall be unclean seven days and all the bed whereon he lieth shall be unclean and if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the time of her separation or if it run beyond the time of her separation all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as the days of her separation she shall be unclean every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto her as the bed of her separation and whatsoever she sitteth upon shall be unclean as the uncleanness of her separation and whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean and shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the even but if she be cleansed of her issue then she shall number to herself seven days and after that she shall be clean and on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles or two young pigeons and bring them unto the priest to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering and the priest shall make an atonement for her before the lord for the issue of her uncleanness thus shall ye separate the children of israel from their uncleanness that they die not in their uncleanness when they defile my tabernacle that is among them this is the law of him that hath an issue and of him whose seed goeth from him and is defiled therewith and of her that is sick of her flowers and of him that hath an issue of the man and of the woman and of him that lieth with her that is unclean and the lord spake unto moses after the death of the two sons of aaron when they offered before the lord and died and the lord said unto moses speak unto aaron thy brother that he come not at all times into the holy place within the vail before the mercy seat which is upon the ark that he die not for i will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat thus shall aaron come into the holy place with a young bullock for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering he shall put on the holy linen coat and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh and shall be girded with a linen girdle and with the linen mitre shall he be attired these are holy garments therefore shall he wash his flesh in water and so put them on and he shall take of the congregation of the children of israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering and one ram for a burnt offering and aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering which is for himself and make an atonement for himself and for his house and he shall take the two goats and present them before the lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats one lot for the lord and the other lot for the scapegoat and aaron shall bring the goat upon which the lords lot fell and offer him for a sin offering but the goat on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat shall be presented alive before the lord to make an atonement with him and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness and aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself and shall make an atonement for himself and for his house and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself and he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the lord and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small and bring it within the vail and he shall put the incense upon the fire before the lord that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony that he die not and he shall take of the blood of the bullock and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering that is for the people and bring his blood within the vail and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat and before the mercy seat and he shall make an atonement for the holy place because of the uncleanness of the children of israel and because of their transgressions in all their sins and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness and there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place until he come out and have made an atonement for himself and for his household and for all the congregation of israel and he shall go out unto the altar that is before the lord and make an atonement for it and shall take of the blood of the bullock and of the blood of the goat and put it upon the horns of the altar round about and he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times and cleanse it and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of israel and when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place and the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar he shall bring the live goat and aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of israel and all their transgressions
