i called none did answer when i spake they did not hear but they did evil before mine eyes and chose that in which i delighted not hear the word of the lord ye that tremble at his word your brethren that hated you that cast you out for my names sake said let the lord be glorified but he shall appear to your joy and they shall be ashamed a voice of noise from the city a voice from the temple a voice of the lord that rendereth recompence to his enemies before she travailed she brought forth before her pain came she was delivered of a man child who hath heard such a thing who hath seen such things shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day or shall a nation be born at once for as soon as zion travailed she brought forth her children shall i bring to the birth and not cause to bring forth saith the lord shall i cause to bring forth and shut the womb saith thy god rejoice ye with jerusalem and be glad with her all ye that love her rejoice for joy with her all ye that mourn for her that ye may suck and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations that ye may milk out and be delighted with the abundance of her glory for thus saith the lord behold i will extend peace to her like a river and the glory of the gentiles like a flowing stream then shall ye suck ye shall be borne upon her sides and be dandled upon her knees as one whom his mother comforteth so will i comfort you and ye shall be comforted in jerusalem and when ye see this your heart shall rejoice and your bones shall flourish like an herb and the hand of the lord shall be known toward his servants and his indignation toward his enemies for behold the lord will come with fire and with his chariots like a whirlwind to render his anger with fury and his rebuke with flames of fire for by fire and by his sword will the lord plead with all flesh and the slain of the lord shall be many they that sanctify themselves and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst eating swines flesh and the abomination and the mouse shall be consumed together saith the lord for i know their works and their thoughts it shall come that i will gather all nations and tongues and they shall come and see my glory and i will set a sign among them and i will send those that escape of them unto the nations to tarshish pul and lud that draw the bow to tubal and javan to the isles afar off that have not heard my fame neither have seen my glory and they shall declare my glory among the gentiles and they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the lord out of all nations upon horses and in chariots and in litters and upon mules and upon swift beasts to my holy mountain jerusalem saith the lord as the children of israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the lord and i will also take of them for priests and for levites saith the lord for as the new heavens and the new earth which i will make shall remain before me saith the lord so shall your seed and your name remain and it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another and from one sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worship before me saith the lord and they shall go forth and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me for their worm shall not die neither shall their fire be quenched and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh the book of the prophet jeremiah the words of jeremiah the son of hilkiah of the priests that were in anathoth in the land of benjamin to whom the word of the lord came in the days of josiah the son of amon king of judah in the thirteenth year of his reign it came also in the days of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah unto the end of the eleventh year of zedekiah the son of josiah king of judah unto the carrying away of jerusalem captive in the fifth month then the word of the lord came unto me saying before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb i sanctified thee

thee and whatsoever i command thee thou shalt speak be not afraid of their faces for i am with thee to deliver thee saith the lord then the lord put forth his hand and touched my mouth and the lord

perform it and the word of the lord came unto me the second time saying what seest thou and i said i see a seething pot and the face thereof is toward the north then the lord said unto me out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land for lo i will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north saith the lord and they shall come and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of jerusalem and against all the walls thereof round about and against all
