risen he is not here behold the place where they laid him but go your way tell his disciples and peter that he goeth before you into galilee there shall ye see him as he said unto you and they went out quickly and fled from the sepulchre for they trembled and were amazed neither said they any thing to any man for they were afraid now when jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to mary magdalene out of whom he had cast seven devils and she went and told them that had been with him as they mourned and wept and they when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen of her believed not after that he appeared in another form unto two of them as they walked and went into the country and they went and told it unto the residue neither believed they them afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of god and they went forth and preached every where the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen the gospel according to saint luke forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us even as they delivered them unto us which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word it seemed good to me also having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first to write unto thee in order most excellent theophilus that thou mightest know the certainty of those things wherein thou hast been instructed there was in the days of herod the king of judaea a certain priest named zacharias of the course of abia and his wife was of the daughters of aaron and her name was elisabeth and they were both righteous before god walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the lord blameless and they had no child because that elisabeth was barren and they both were now well stricken in years and it came to pass that while he executed the priests office before god in the order of his course according to the custom of the priests office his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the lord and the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense and there appeared unto him an angel of the lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense and when zacharias saw him he was troubled and fear fell upon him but the angel said unto him fear not zacharias for thy prayer is heard and thy wife elisabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name john and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the holy ghost even from his mothers womb and many of the children of israel shall he turn to the lord their god and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the lord and zacharias said unto the angel whereby shall i know this for i am an old man and my wife well stricken in years and the angel answering said unto him i am gabriel that stand in the presence of god and am sent to speak unto thee and to shew thee these glad tidings and behold thou shalt be dumb and not able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed because thou believest not my words which shall be fulfilled in their season and the people waited for zacharias and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple and when he came out he could not speak unto them and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple for he beckoned unto them and remained speechless and it came to pass that as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished he departed to his own house and after those days his wife elisabeth conceived and hid herself five months saying thus hath the lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me to take away my reproach among men and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto a city of galilee named nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgins name was mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou that art highly favoured the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou hast found favour with god and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt call his name jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob for ever and of his kingdom there shall be no
