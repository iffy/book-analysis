righteous shall see their fall correct thy son and he shall give thee rest yea he shall give delight unto thy soul where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he a servant will not be corrected by words for though he understand he will not answer seest thou a man that is hasty in his words there is more hope of a fool than of him he that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at the length an angry man stirreth up strife and a furious man aboundeth in transgression a mans pride shall bring him low but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul he heareth cursing and bewrayeth it not the fear of man bringeth a snare but whoso putteth his trust in the lord shall be safe many seek the rulers favour but every mans judgment cometh from the lord an unjust man is an abomination to the just and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked the words of agur the son of jakeh even the prophecy the man spake unto ithiel even unto ithiel and ucal surely i am more brutish than any man and have not the understanding of a man i neither learned wisdom nor have the knowledge of the holy who hath ascended up into heaven or descended who hath gathered the wind in his fists who hath bound the waters in a garment who hath established all the ends of the earth what is his name and what is his sons name if thou canst tell every word of god is pure he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him add thou not unto his words lest he reprove thee and thou be found a liar two things have i required of thee deny me them not before i die remove far from me vanity and lies give me neither poverty nor riches feed me with food convenient for me lest i be full and deny thee and say who is the lord or lest i be poor and steal and take the name of my god in vain accuse not a servant unto his master lest he curse thee and thou be found guilty there is a generation that curseth their father and doth not bless their mother there is a generation that are pure in their own eyes and yet is not washed from their filthiness there is a generation o how lofty are their eyes and their eyelids are lifted up there is a generation whose teeth are as swords and their jaw teeth as knives to devour the poor from off the earth and the needy from among men the horseleach hath two daughters crying give give there are three things that are never satisfied yea four things say not it is enough the grave and the barren womb the earth that is not filled with water and the fire that saith not it is enough the eye that mocketh at his father and despiseth to obey his mother the ravens of the valley shall pick it out and the young eagles shall eat it there be three things which are too wonderful for me yea four which i know not the way of an eagle in the air the way of a serpent upon a rock the way of a ship in the midst of the sea and the way of a man with a maid such is the way of an adulterous woman she eateth and wipeth her mouth and saith i have done no wickedness for three things the earth is disquieted and for four which it cannot bear for a servant when he reigneth and a fool when he is filled with meat for an odious woman when she is married and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress there be four things which are little upon the earth but they are exceeding wise the ants are a people not strong yet they prepare their meat in the summer the conies are but a feeble folk yet make they their houses in the rocks the locusts have no king yet go they forth all of them by bands the spider taketh hold with her hands and is in kings palaces there be three things which go well yea four are comely in going a lion which is strongest among beasts and turneth not away for any a greyhound an he goat also and a king against whom there is no rising up if thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself or if thou hast thought evil lay thine hand upon thy mouth surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife the words of king lemuel the prophecy that his mother taught him what my son and what the son of my womb and what the son of my vows give not thy strength unto women nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings it is not for kings o lemuel it is not for kings to drink wine nor for princes strong drink lest they drink and forget the law and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts let him drink and forget his poverty and remember his misery no more open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction open thy mouth judge righteously and plead the cause of the poor and needy who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies the heart of her husband doth safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life she seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with her hands she is like the merchants ships she bringeth her food from afar she riseth also while it is yet night and giveth meat to her household and a portion to her maidens she considereth a field and
