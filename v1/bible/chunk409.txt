buyeth it with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard she girdeth her loins with strength and strengtheneth her arms she perceiveth that her merchandise is good her candle goeth not out by night she layeth her hands to the spindle and her hands hold the distaff she stretcheth out her hand to the poor yea she reacheth forth her hands to the needy she is not afraid of the snow for her household for all her household are clothed with scarlet she maketh herself coverings of tapestry her clothing is silk and purple her husband is known in the gates when he sitteth among the elders of the land she maketh fine linen and selleth it and delivereth girdles unto the merchant strength and honour are her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come she openeth her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness she looketh well to the ways of her household and eateth not the bread of idleness her children arise up and call her blessed her husband also and he praiseth her many daughters have done virtuously but thou excellest them all favour is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that feareth the lord she shall be praised give her of the fruit of her hands and let her own works praise her in the gates ecclesiastes or the preacher the words of the preacher the son of david king in jerusalem vanity of vanities saith the preacher vanity of vanities all is vanity what profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun one generation passeth away and another generation cometh but the earth abideth for ever the sun also ariseth and the sun goeth down and hasteth to his place where he arose the wind goeth toward the south and turneth about unto the north it whirleth about continually and the wind returneth again according to his circuits all the rivers run into the sea yet the sea is not full unto the place from whence the rivers come thither they return again all things are full of labour man cannot utter it the eye is not satisfied with seeing nor the ear filled with hearing the thing that hath been it is that which shall be and that which is done is that which shall be done and there is no new thing under the sun is there any thing whereof it may be said see this is new it hath been already of old time which was before us there is no remembrance of former things neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after i the preacher was king over israel in jerusalem and i gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven this sore travail hath god given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith i have seen all the works that are done under the sun and behold all is vanity and vexation of spirit that which is crooked cannot be made straight and that which is wanting cannot be numbered i communed with mine own heart saying lo i am come to great estate and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in jerusalem yea my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge and i gave my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly i perceived that this also is vexation of spirit for in much wisdom is much grief and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow i said in mine heart go to now i will prove thee with mirth therefore enjoy pleasure and behold this also is vanity i said of laughter it is mad and of mirth what doeth it i sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom and to lay hold on folly till i might see what was that good for the sons of men which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life i made me great works i builded me houses i planted me vineyards i made me gardens and orchards and i planted trees in them of all kind of fruits i made me pools of water to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees i got me servants and maidens and had servants born in my house also i had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in jerusalem before me i gathered me also silver and gold and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces i gat me men singers and women singers and the delights of the sons of men as musical instruments and that of all sorts so i was great and increased more than all that were before me in jerusalem also my wisdom remained with me and whatsoever mine eyes desired i kept not from them i withheld not my heart from any joy for my heart rejoiced in all my labour and this was my portion of all my labour then i looked on all the works that my hands had wrought and on the labour that i had laboured to do and behold all was vanity and vexation of spirit and there was no profit under the sun and i turned myself to behold wisdom and madness and folly for what can the man do that cometh after the king even that which hath been already done then i saw that wisdom excelleth folly as far as light excelleth darkness the wise mans eyes are in his head but the fool walketh in darkness and i myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all then said i in my heart as it happeneth to the fool so it happeneth even to me and why was i then more wise then i said in my heart that this also is vanity for there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten and how dieth the wise man as the fool therefore i hated life because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous
