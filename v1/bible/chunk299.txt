lord had chosen out of all the tribes of israel to put his name there and his mothers name was naamah an ammonitess and he did evil because he prepared not his heart to seek the lord now the acts of rehoboam first and last are they not written in the book of shemaiah the prophet and of iddo the seer concerning genealogies and there were wars between rehoboam and jeroboam continually and rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of david and abijah his son reigned in his stead now in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam began abijah to reign over judah he reigned three years in jerusalem his mothers name also was michaiah the daughter of uriel of gibeah and there was war between abijah and jeroboam and abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war even four hundred thousand chosen men jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men being mighty men of valour and abijah stood up upon mount zemaraim which is in mount ephraim and said hear me thou jeroboam and all israel ought ye not to know that the lord god of israel gave the kingdom over israel to david for ever even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt yet jeroboam the son of nebat the servant of solomon the son of david is risen up and hath rebelled against his lord and there are gathered unto him vain men the children of belial and have strengthened themselves against rehoboam the son of solomon when rehoboam was young and tenderhearted and could not withstand them and now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the lord in the hand of the sons of david and ye be a great multitude and there are with your golden calves which jeroboam made you for gods have ye not cast out the priests of the lord the sons of aaron and the levites and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of other lands so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams the same may be a priest of them that are no gods but as for us the lord is our god and we have not forsaken him and the priests which minister unto the lord are the sons of aaron and the levites wait upon their business and they burn unto the lord every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure table and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof to burn every evening for we keep the charge of the lord our god but ye have forsaken him and behold god himself is with us for our captain and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you o children of israel fight ye not against the lord god of your fathers for ye shall not prosper but jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them so they were before judah and the ambushment was behind them and when judah looked back behold the battle was before and behind and they cried unto the lord and the priests sounded with the trumpets then the men of judah gave a shout and as the men of judah shouted it came to pass that god smote jeroboam and all israel before abijah and judah and the children of israel fled before judah and god delivered them into their hand and abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter so there fell down slain of israel five hundred thousand chosen men thus the children of israel were brought under at that time and the children of judah prevailed because they relied upon the lord god of their fathers and abijah pursued after jeroboam and took cities from him bethel with the towns thereof and jeshanah with the towns thereof and ephraim with the towns thereof neither did jeroboam recover strength again in the days of abijah and the lord struck him and he died but abijah waxed mighty and married fourteen wives and begat twenty and two sons and sixteen daughters and the rest of the acts of abijah and his ways and his sayings are written in the story of the prophet iddo so abijah slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of david and asa his son reigned in his stead in his days the land was quiet ten years and asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the lord his god for he took away the altars of the strange gods and the high places and brake down the images and cut down the groves and commanded judah to seek the lord god of their fathers and to do the law and the commandment also he took away out of all the cities of judah the high places and the images and the kingdom was quiet before him and he built fenced cities in judah for the land had rest and he had no war in those years because the lord had given him rest therefore he said unto judah let us build these cities and make about them walls and towers gates and bars while the land is yet before us because we have sought the lord our god we have sought him and he hath given us rest on every side so they built and prospered and asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears out of judah three hundred thousand and out of benjamin that bare shields and drew bows two hundred and fourscore thousand all these were mighty men of valour and there came out against them zerah the ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand and three hundred chariots and came unto mareshah then asa went out against him and they set the battle in array in the valley of zephathah at mareshah and asa cried unto the lord his god and said lord it is nothing with thee to help whether with many or with them that have no power help us o lord our god for we rest on thee and in thy name we go against this multitude o lord thou art
