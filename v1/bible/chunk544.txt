not judah offend and come not ye unto gilgal neither go ye up to bethaven nor swear the lord liveth for israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer now the lord will feed them as a lamb in a large place ephraim is joined to idols let him alone their drink is sour they have committed whoredom continually her rulers with shame do love give ye the wind hath bound her up in her wings and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices hear ye this o priests and hearken ye house of israel and give ye ear o house of the king for judgment is toward you because ye have been a snare on mizpah and a net spread upon tabor and the revolters are profound to make slaughter though i have been a rebuker of them all i know ephraim and israel is not hid from me for now o ephraim thou committest whoredom and israel is defiled they will not frame their doings to turn unto their god for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them and they have not known the lord and the pride of israel doth testify to his face therefore shall israel and ephraim fall in their iniquity judah also shall fall with them they shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the lord but they shall not find him he hath withdrawn himself from them they have dealt treacherously against the lord for they have begotten strange children now shall a month devour them with their portions blow ye the cornet in gibeah and the trumpet in ramah cry aloud at bethaven after thee o benjamin ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke among the tribes of israel have i made known that which shall surely be the princes of judah were like them that remove the bound therefore i will pour out my wrath upon them like water ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment because he willingly walked after the commandment therefore will i be unto ephraim as a moth and to the house of judah as rottenness when ephraim saw his sickness and judah saw his wound then went ephraim to the assyrian and sent to king jareb yet could he not heal you nor cure you of your wound for i will be unto ephraim as a lion and as a young lion to the house of judah i even i will tear and go away i will take away and none shall rescue him i will go and return to my place till they acknowledge their offence and seek my face in their affliction they will seek me early come and let us return unto the lord for he hath torn and he will heal us he hath smitten and he will bind us up after two days will he revive us in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight then shall we know if we follow on to know the lord his going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the rain as the latter and former rain unto the earth o ephraim what shall i do unto thee o judah what shall i do unto thee for your goodness is as a morning cloud and as the early dew it goeth away therefore have i hewed them by the prophets i have slain them by the words of my mouth and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth for i desired mercy and not sacrifice and the knowledge of god more than burnt offerings but they like men have transgressed the covenant there have they dealt treacherously against me gilead is a city of them that work iniquity and is polluted with blood and as troops of robbers wait for a man so the company of priests murder in the way by consent for they commit lewdness i have seen an horrible thing in the house of israel there is the whoredom of ephraim israel is defiled also o judah he hath set an harvest for thee when i returned the captivity of my people when i would have healed israel then the iniquity of ephraim was discovered and the wickedness of samaria for they commit falsehood and the thief cometh in and the troop of robbers spoileth without and they consider not in their hearts that i remember all their wickedness now their own doings have beset them about they are before my face they make the king glad with their wickedness and the princes with their lies they are all adulterers as an oven heated by the baker who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough until it be leavened in the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine he stretched out his hand with scorners for they have made ready their heart like an oven whiles they lie in wait their baker sleepeth all the night in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire they are all hot as an oven and have devoured their judges all their kings are fallen there is none among them that calleth unto me ephraim he hath mixed himself among the people ephraim is a cake not turned strangers have devoured his strength and he knoweth it not yea gray hairs are here and there upon him yet he knoweth not and the pride of israel testifieth to his face and they do not return to the lord their god nor seek him for all this ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart they call to egypt they go to assyria when they shall go i will spread my net upon them i will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven i will chastise them as their congregation hath heard woe unto them for they have fled from me destruction unto them because they have transgressed against me though i have redeemed them yet they have spoken lies against me and they have not cried unto me with their heart when they howled upon their beds they assemble themselves for corn and wine and they rebel against me though i have bound and strengthened their arms yet do they imagine mischief against me they
