our god let no man prevail against thee so the lord smote the ethiopians before asa and before judah and the ethiopians fled and asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto gerar and the ethiopians were overthrown that they could not recover themselves for they were destroyed before the lord and before his host and they carried away very much spoil and they smote all the cities round about gerar for the fear of the lord came upon them and they spoiled all the cities for there was exceeding much spoil in them they smote also the tents of cattle and carried away sheep and camels in abundance and returned to jerusalem and the spirit of god came upon azariah the son of oded and he went out to meet asa and said unto him hear ye me asa and all judah and benjamin the lord is with you while ye be with him and if ye seek him he will be found of you but if ye forsake him he will forsake you now for a long season israel hath been without the true god and without a teaching priest and without law but when they in their trouble did turn unto the lord god of israel and sought him he was found of them and in those times there was no peace to him that went out nor to him that came in but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries and nation was destroyed of nation and city of city for god did vex them with all adversity be ye strong therefore and let not your hands be weak for your work shall be rewarded and when asa heard these words and the prophecy of oded the prophet he took courage and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of judah and benjamin and out of the cities which he had taken from mount ephraim and renewed the altar of the lord that was before the porch of the lord and he gathered all judah and benjamin and the strangers with them out of ephraim and manasseh and out of simeon for they fell to him out of israel in abundance when they saw that the lord his god was with him so they gathered themselves together at jerusalem in the third month in the fifteenth year of the reign of asa and they offered unto the lord the same time of the spoil which they had brought seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep and they entered into a covenant to seek the lord god of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul that whosoever would not seek the lord god of israel should be put to death whether small or great whether man or woman and they sware unto the lord with a loud voice and with shouting and with trumpets and with cornets and all judah rejoiced at the oath for they had sworn with all their heart and sought him with their whole desire and he was found of them and the lord gave them rest round about and also concerning maachah the mother of asa the king he removed her from being queen because she had made an idol in a grove and asa cut down her idol and stamped it and burnt it at the brook kidron but the high places were not taken away out of israel nevertheless the heart of asa was perfect all his days and he brought into the house of god the things that his father had dedicated and that he himself had dedicated silver and gold and vessels and there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of asa in the six and thirtieth year of the reign of asa baasha king of israel came up against judah and built ramah to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to asa king of judah then asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the lord and of the kings house and sent to benhadad king of syria that dwelt at damascus saying there is a league between me and thee as there was between my father and thy father behold i have sent thee silver and gold go break thy league with baasha king of israel that he may depart from me and benhadad hearkened unto king asa and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of israel and they smote ijon and dan and abelmaim and all the store cities of naphtali and it came to pass when baasha heard it that he left off building of ramah and let his work cease then asa the king took all judah and they carried away the stones of ramah and the timber thereof wherewith baasha was building and he built therewith geba and mizpah and at that time hanani the seer came to asa king of judah and said unto him because thou hast relied on the king of syria and not relied on the lord thy god therefore is the host of the king of syria escaped out of thine hand were not the ethiopians and the lubims a huge host with very many chariots and horsemen yet because thou didst rely on the lord he delivered them into thine hand for the eyes of the lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him herein thou hast done foolishly therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars then asa was wroth with the seer and put him in a prison house for he was in a rage with him because of this thing and asa oppressed some of the people the same time and behold the acts of asa first and last lo they are written in the book of the kings of judah and israel and asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet until his disease was exceeding great yet in his disease he sought not to the lord but to the physicians and asa slept with his fathers and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign and they buried him in
