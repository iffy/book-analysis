according to the burnt offering and according to the meat offering and according to the oil thus saith the lord god the gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days but on the sabbath it shall be opened and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened and the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate without and shall stand by the post of the gate and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate then he shall go forth but the gate shall not be shut until the

out by the way of the south gate and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in but shall go forth over against it and the prince in the midst of them when they go in shall go in and when they go forth shall go forth and in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an

unto the lord thus shall they prepare the lamb and the meat offering and the oil every morning for a continual burnt offering thus saith the lord god if the prince give a gift unto any of his sons the inheritance thereof shall be his sons it shall be their possession by inheritance but if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants then it shall be his to the year of liberty after it shall return to the prince but his inheritance shall be his sons for them moreover the prince shall not take of the peoples inheritance by oppression to thrust them out of their possession but he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession that my people be not scattered every man from his possession after he brought me through the entry which was at the side of the gate into the holy chambers of the priests which looked toward the north and behold there was a place on the two sides westward then said he unto me this is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering where they shall bake the meat offering that they bear them not out into the utter court to sanctify the people then he brought me forth into the utter court and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court and behold in every corner of the court there was a court in the four corners of the court there were courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty broad these four corners were of one measure and there was a row of building round about in them round about them four and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about then said he unto me these are the places of them that boil where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house and behold waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward for the forefront of the house stood toward the east and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house at the south
