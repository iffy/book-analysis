come out to fight against thee he sent messengers again unto hezekiah saying thus shall ye speak to hezekiah king of judah saying let not thy god in whom thou trustest deceive thee saying jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of assyria behold thou hast heard what the kings of assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly and shalt thou be delivered have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed as gozan and haran and rezeph and the children of eden which were in thelasar where is the king of hamath and the king of arpad and the king of the city of sepharvaim of hena and ivah and hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers and read it and hezekiah went up into the house of the lord and spread it before the lord and hezekiah prayed before the lord and said o lord god of israel which dwellest between the cherubims thou art the god even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou hast made heaven and earth lord bow down thine ear and hear open lord thine eyes and see and hear the words of sennacherib which hath sent him to reproach the living god of a truth lord the kings of assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands and have cast their gods into the fire for they were no gods but the work of mens hands wood and stone therefore they have destroyed them now therefore o lord our god i beseech thee save thou us out of his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the lord god even thou only then isaiah the son of amoz sent to hezekiah saying thus saith the lord god of israel that which thou hast prayed to me against sennacherib king of assyria i have heard this is the word that the lord hath spoken concerning him the virgin the daughter of zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn the daughter of jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high even against the holy one of israel by thy messengers thou hast reproached the lord and hast said with the multitude of my chariots i am come up to the height of the mountains to the sides of lebanon and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof and the choice fir trees thereof and i will enter into the lodgings of his borders and into the forest of his carmel i have digged and drunk strange waters and with the sole of my feet have i dried up all the rivers of besieged places hast thou not heard long ago how i have done it and of ancient times that i have formed it now have i brought it to pass that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps therefore their inhabitants were of small power they were dismayed and confounded they were as the grass of the field and as the green herb as the grass on the house tops and as corn blasted before it be grown up but i know thy abode and thy going out and thy coming in and thy rage against me because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears therefore i will put my hook in thy nose and my bridle in thy lips and i will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest and this shall be a sign unto thee ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves and in the second year that which springeth of the same and in the third year sow ye and reap and plant vineyards and eat the fruits thereof and the remnant that is escaped of the house of judah shall yet again take root downward and bear fruit upward for out of jerusalem shall go forth a remnant and they that escape out of mount zion the zeal of the lord of hosts shall do this therefore thus saith the lord concerning the king of assyria he shall not come into this city nor shoot an arrow there nor come before it with shield nor cast a bank against it by the way that he came by the same shall he return and shall not come into this city saith the lord for i will defend this city to save it for mine own sake and for my servant davids sake and it came to pass that night that the angel of the lord went out and smote in the camp of the assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand and when they arose early in the morning behold they were all dead corpses so sennacherib king of assyria departed and went and returned and dwelt at nineveh and it came to pass as he was worshipping in the house of nisroch his god that adrammelech and sharezer his sons smote him with the sword and they escaped into the land of armenia and esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead in those days was hezekiah sick unto death and the prophet isaiah the son of amoz came to him and said unto him thus saith the lord set thine house in order for thou shalt die and not live then he turned his face to the wall and prayed unto the lord saying i beseech thee o lord remember now how i have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and hezekiah wept sore and it came to pass afore isaiah was gone out into the middle court that the word of the lord came to him saying turn again and tell hezekiah the captain of my people thus saith the lord the god of david thy father i have heard thy prayer i have seen thy tears behold i will heal thee on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the lord and i will add unto thy days fifteen years and i will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of
