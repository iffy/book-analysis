doubted of them whereunto this would grow then came one and told them saying behold the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people then went the captain with the officers and brought them without violence for they feared the people lest they should have been stoned and when they had brought them they set them before the council and the high priest asked them saying did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name and behold ye have filled jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring this mans blood upon us then peter and the other apostles answered and said we ought to obey god rather than men the god of our fathers raised up jesus whom ye slew and hanged on a tree him hath god exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a saviour for to give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins and we are his witnesses of these things and so is also the holy ghost whom god hath given to them that obey him when they heard that they were cut to the heart and took counsel to slay them then stood there up one in the council a pharisee named gamaliel a doctor of the law had in reputation among all the people and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space and said unto them ye men of israel take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men for before these days rose up theudas boasting himself to be somebody to whom a number of men about four hundred joined themselves who was slain and all as many as obeyed him were scattered and brought to nought after this man rose up judas of galilee in the days of the taxing and drew away much people after him he also perished and all even as many as obeyed him were dispersed and now i say unto you refrain from these men and let them alone for if this counsel or this work be of men it will come to nought but if it be of god ye cannot overthrow it lest haply ye be found even to fight against god and to him they agreed and when they had called the apostles and beaten them they commanded that they should not speak in the name of jesus and let them go and they departed from the presence of the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name and daily in the temple and in every house they ceased not to teach and preach jesus christ and in those days when the number of the disciples was multiplied there arose a murmuring of the grecians against the hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them and said it is not reason that we should leave the word of god and serve tables wherefore brethren look ye out among you seven men of honest report full of the holy ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint over this business but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word and the saying pleased the whole multitude and they chose stephen a man full of faith and of the holy ghost and philip and prochorus and nicanor and timon and parmenas and nicolas a proselyte of antioch whom they set before the apostles and when they had prayed they laid their hands on them and the word of god increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in jerusalem greatly and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith and stephen full of faith and power did great wonders and miracles among the people then there arose certain of the synagogue which is called the synagogue of the libertines and cyrenians and alexandrians and of them of cilicia and of asia disputing with stephen and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake then they suborned men which said we have heard him speak blasphemous words against moses and against god and they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes and came upon him and caught him and brought him to the council and set up false witnesses which said this man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place and the law for we have heard him say that this jesus of nazareth shall destroy this place and shall change the customs which moses delivered us and all that sat in the council looking stedfastly on him saw his face as it had been the face of an angel then said the high priest are these things so and he said men brethren and fathers hearken the god of glory appeared unto our father abraham when he was in mesopotamia before he dwelt in charran and said unto him get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and come into the land which i shall shew thee then came he out of the land of the chaldaeans and dwelt in charran and from thence when his father was dead he removed him into this land wherein ye now dwell and he gave him none inheritance in it no not so much as to set his foot on yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession and to his seed after him when as yet he had no child and god spake on this wise that his seed should sojourn in a strange land and that they should bring them into bondage and entreat them evil four hundred years and the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will i judge said god and after that shall they come forth and serve me in this place and he gave him the covenant of circumcision and so abraham begat isaac and circumcised him the eighth day and isaac begat jacob and jacob begat the twelve patriarchs and the patriarchs moved with envy sold joseph into egypt but god was with him and delivered him out of all his afflictions and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of pharaoh king of egypt and he made
