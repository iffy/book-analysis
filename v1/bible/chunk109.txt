hand and they came unto balaam and spake unto him the words of balak and he said unto them lodge here this night and i will bring you word again as the lord shall speak unto me and the princes of moab abode with balaam and god came unto balaam and said what men are these with thee and balaam said unto god balak the son of zippor king of moab hath sent unto me saying behold there is a people come out of egypt which covereth the face of the earth come now curse me them peradventure i shall be able to overcome them and drive them out and god said unto balaam thou shalt not go with them thou shalt not curse the people for they are blessed and balaam rose up in the morning and said unto the princes of balak get you into your land for the lord refuseth to give me leave to go with you and the princes of moab rose up and they went unto balak and said balaam refuseth to come with us and balak sent yet again princes more and more honourable than they and they came to balaam and said to him thus saith balak the son of zippor let nothing i pray thee hinder thee from coming unto me for i will promote thee unto very great honour and i will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me come therefore i pray thee curse me this people and balaam answered and said unto the servants of balak if balak would give me his house full of silver and gold i cannot go beyond the word of the lord my god to do less or more now therefore i pray you tarry ye also here this night that i may know what the lord will say unto me more and god came unto balaam at night and said unto him if the men come to call thee rise up and go with them but yet the word which i shall say unto thee that shalt thou do and balaam rose up in the morning and saddled his ass and went with the princes of moab and gods anger was kindled because he went and the angel of the lord stood in the way for an adversary against him now he was riding upon his ass and his two servants were with him and the ass saw the angel of the lord standing in the way and his sword drawn in his hand and the ass turned aside out of the way and went into the field and balaam smote the ass to turn her into the way but the angel of the lord stood in a path of the vineyards a wall being on this side and a wall on that side and when the ass saw the angel of the lord she thrust herself unto the wall and crushed balaams foot against the wall and he smote her again and the angel of the lord went further and stood in a narrow place where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left and when the ass saw the angel of the lord she fell down under balaam and balaams anger was kindled and he smote the ass with a staff and the lord opened the mouth of the ass and she said unto balaam what have i done unto thee that thou hast smitten me these three times and balaam said unto the ass because thou hast mocked me i would there were a sword in mine hand for now would i kill thee and the ass said unto balaam am not i thine ass upon which thou hast ridden ever since i was thine unto this day was i ever wont to do so unto thee and he said nay then the lord opened the eyes of balaam and he saw the angel of the lord standing in the way and his sword drawn in his hand and he bowed down his head and fell flat on his face and the angel of the lord said unto him wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times behold i went out to withstand thee because thy way is perverse before me and the ass saw me and turned from me these three times unless she had turned from me surely now also i had slain thee and saved her alive and balaam said unto the angel of the lord i have sinned for i knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me now therefore if it displease thee i will get me back again and the angel of the lord said unto balaam go with the men but only the word that i shall speak unto thee that thou shalt speak so balaam went with the princes of balak and when balak heard that balaam was come he went out to meet him unto a city of moab which is in the border of arnon which is in the utmost coast and balak said unto balaam did i not earnestly send unto thee to call thee wherefore camest thou not unto me am i not able indeed to promote thee to honour and balaam said unto balak lo i am come unto thee have i now any power at all to say any thing the word that god putteth in my mouth that shall i speak and balaam went with balak and they came unto kirjathhuzoth and balak offered oxen and sheep and sent to balaam and to the princes that were with him and it came to pass on the morrow that balak took balaam and brought him up into the high places of baal that thence he might see the utmost part of the people and balaam said unto balak build me here seven altars and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams and balak did as balaam had spoken and balak and balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram and balaam said unto balak stand by thy burnt offering and i will go peradventure the lord will come to meet me and whatsoever he sheweth me i will tell thee and he went to an high place and god met balaam and he said unto him i have prepared seven altars and
