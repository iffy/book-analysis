are in the land of egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine until there be an end of them yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of egypt into the land of judah and all the remnant of judah that are gone into the land of egypt to sojourn there shall know whose words shall stand mine or theirs and this shall be a sign unto you saith the lord that i will punish you in this place that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil thus saith the lord behold i will give pharaohhophra king of egypt into the hand of his enemies and into the hand of them that seek his life as i gave zedekiah king of judah into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon his enemy and that sought his life the word that jeremiah the prophet spake unto baruch the son of neriah when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of jeremiah in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah saying thus saith the lord the god of israel unto thee o baruch thou didst say woe is me now for the lord hath added grief to my sorrow i fainted in my sighing and i find no rest thus shalt thou say unto him the lord saith thus behold that which i have built will i break down and that which i have planted i will pluck up even this whole land and seekest thou great things for thyself seek them not for behold i will bring evil upon all flesh saith the lord but thy life will i give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest the word of the lord which came to jeremiah the prophet against the gentiles against egypt against the army of pharaohnecho king of egypt which was by the river euphrates in carchemish which nebuchadrezzar king of babylon smote in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah order ye the buckler and shield and draw near to battle harness the horses and get up ye horsemen and stand forth with your helmets furbish the spears and put on the brigandines wherefore have i seen them dismayed and turned away back and their mighty ones are beaten down and are fled apace and look not back for fear was round about saith the lord let not the swift flee away nor the mighty man escape they shall stumble and fall toward the north by the river euphrates who is this that cometh up as a flood whose waters are moved as the rivers egypt riseth up like a flood and his waters are moved like the rivers and he saith i will go up and will cover the earth i will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof come up ye horses and rage ye chariots and let the mighty men come forth the ethiopians and the libyans that handle the shield and the lydians that handle and bend the bow for this is the day of the lord god of hosts a day of vengeance that he may avenge him of his adversaries and the sword shall devour and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood for the lord god of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river euphrates go up into gilead and take balm o virgin the daughter of egypt in vain shalt thou use many medicines for thou shalt not be cured the nations have heard of thy shame and thy cry hath filled the land for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty and they are fallen both together the word that the lord spake to jeremiah the prophet how nebuchadrezzar king of babylon should come and smite the land of egypt declare ye in egypt and publish in migdol and publish in noph and in tahpanhes say ye stand fast and prepare thee for the sword shall devour round about thee why are thy valiant men swept away they stood not because the lord did drive them he made many to fall yea one fell upon another and they said arise and let us go again to our own people and to the land of our nativity from the oppressing sword they did cry there pharaoh king of egypt is but a noise he hath passed the time appointed as i live saith the king whose name is the lord of hosts surely as tabor is among the mountains and as carmel by the sea so shall he come o thou daughter dwelling in egypt furnish thyself to go into captivity for noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant egypt is like a very fair heifer but destruction cometh it cometh out of the north also her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks for they also are turned back and are fled away together they did not stand because the day of their calamity was come upon them and the time of their visitation the voice thereof shall go like a serpent for they shall march with an army and come against her with axes as hewers of wood they shall cut down her forest saith the lord though it cannot be searched because they are more than the grasshoppers and are innumerable the daughter of egypt shall be confounded she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north the lord of hosts the god of israel saith behold i will punish the multitude of no and pharaoh and egypt with their gods and their kings even pharaoh and all them that trust in him and i will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives and into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and into the hand of his servants and afterward it shall be inhabited as in the days of old saith the lord but fear not thou o my servant jacob and be not dismayed o israel for behold i will save thee from afar off and thy seed from the land of their captivity and jacob shall return and be in rest and at ease and none
