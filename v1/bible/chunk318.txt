we do sacrifice unto him since the days of esarhaddon king of assur which brought us up hither but zerubbabel and jeshua and the rest of the chief of the fathers of israel said unto them ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our god but we ourselves together will build unto the lord god of israel as king cyrus the king of persia hath commanded us then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of judah and troubled them in building and hired counsellors against them to frustrate their purpose all the days of cyrus king of persia even until the reign of darius king of persia and in the reign of ahasuerus in the beginning of his reign wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of judah and jerusalem and in the days of artaxerxes wrote bishlam mithredath tabeel and the rest of their companions unto artaxerxes king of persia and the writing of the letter was written in the syrian tongue and interpreted in the syrian tongue rehum the chancellor and shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against jerusalem to artaxerxes the king in this sort then wrote rehum the chancellor and shimshai the scribe and the rest of their companions the dinaites the apharsathchites the tarpelites the apharsites the archevites the babylonians the susanchites the dehavites and the elamites and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble asnapper brought over and set in the cities of samaria and the rest that are on this side the river and at such a time this is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him even unto artaxerxes the king thy servants the men on this side the river and at such a time be it known unto the king that the jews which came up from thee to us are come unto jerusalem building the rebellious and the bad city and have set up the walls thereof and joined the foundations be it known now unto the king that if this city be builded and the walls set up again then will they not pay toll tribute and custom and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings now because we have maintenance from the kings palace and it was not meet for us to see the kings dishonour therefore have we sent and certified the king that search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers so shalt thou find in the book of the records and know that this city is a rebellious city and hurtful unto kings and provinces and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time for which cause was this city destroyed we certify the king that if this city be builded again and the walls thereof set up by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river then sent the king an answer unto rehum the chancellor and to shimshai the scribe and to the rest of their companions that dwell in samaria and unto the rest beyond the river peace and at such a time the letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me and i commanded and search hath been made and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein there have been mighty kings also over jerusalem which have ruled over all countries beyond the river and toll tribute and custom was paid unto them give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease and that this city be not builded until another commandment shall be given from me take heed now that ye fail not to do this why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings now when the copy of king artaxerxes letter was read before rehum and shimshai the scribe and their companions they went up in haste to jerusalem unto the jews and made them to cease by force and power then ceased the work of the house of god which is at jerusalem so it ceased unto the second year of the reign of darius king of persia then the prophets haggai the prophet and zechariah the son of iddo prophesied unto the jews that were in judah and jerusalem in the name of the god of israel even unto them then rose up zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and jeshua the son of jozadak and began to build the house of god which is at jerusalem and with them were the prophets of god helping them at the same time came to them tatnai governor on this side the river and shetharboznai and their companions and said thus unto them who hath commanded you to build this house and to make up this wall then said we unto them after this manner what are the names of the men that make this building but the eye of their god was upon the elders of the jews that they could not cause them to cease till the matter came to darius and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter the copy of the letter that tatnai governor on this side the river and shetharboznai and his companions the apharsachites which were on this side the river sent unto darius the king they sent a letter unto him wherein was written thus unto darius the king all peace be it known unto the king that we went into the province of judea to the house of the great god which is builded with great stones and timber is laid in the walls and this work goeth fast on and prospereth in their hands then asked we those elders and said unto them thus who commanded you to build this house and to make up these walls we asked their names also to certify thee that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them and thus they returned us answer saying we are the servants of the god of heaven and earth and build the house that was builded these many years ago which a great king of israel builded and set up but after that our fathers had provoked the god of heaven unto
