masters crib but israel doth not know my people doth not consider ah sinful nation a people laden with iniquity a seed of evildoers children that are corrupters they have forsaken the lord they have provoked the holy one of israel unto anger they are gone away backward why should ye be stricken any more ye will revolt more and more the whole head is sick and the whole heart faint from the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it but wounds and bruises and putrifying sores they have not been closed neither bound up neither mollified with ointment your country is desolate your cities are burned with fire your land strangers devour it in your presence and it is desolate as overthrown by strangers and the daughter of zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers as a besieged city except the lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant we should have been as sodom and we should have been like unto gomorrah hear the word of the lord ye rulers of sodom give ear unto the law of our god ye people of gomorrah to what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me saith the lord i am full of the burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts and i delight not in the blood of bullocks or of lambs or of he goats when ye come to appear before me who hath required this at your hand to tread my courts bring no more vain oblations incense is an abomination unto me the new moons and sabbaths the calling of assemblies i cannot away with it is iniquity even the solemn meeting your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth they are a trouble unto me i am weary to bear them and when ye spread forth your hands i will hide mine eyes from you yea when ye make many prayers i will not hear your hands are full of blood wash you make you clean put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes cease to do evil learn to do well seek judgment relieve the oppressed judge the fatherless plead for the widow come now and let us reason together saith the lord though your sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they be red like crimson they shall be as wool if ye be willing and obedient ye shall eat the good of the land but if ye refuse and rebel ye shall be devoured with the sword for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it how is the faithful city become an harlot it was full of judgment righteousness lodged in it but now murderers thy silver is become dross thy wine mixed with water thy princes are rebellious and companions of thieves every one loveth gifts and followeth after rewards they judge not the fatherless neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them therefore saith the lord the lord of hosts the mighty one of israel ah i will ease me of mine adversaries and avenge me of mine enemies and i will turn my hand upon thee and purely purge away thy dross and take away all thy tin and i will restore thy judges as at the first and thy counsellors as at the beginning afterward thou shalt be called the city of righteousness the faithful city zion shall be redeemed with judgment and her converts with righteousness and the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together and they that forsake the lord shall be consumed for they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen for ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth and as a garden that hath no water and the strong shall be as tow and the maker of it as a spark and they shall both burn together and none shall quench them the word that isaiah the son of amoz saw concerning judah and jerusalem and it shall come to pass in the last days that the mountain of the lords house shall be established in the top of the mountains and shall be exalted above the hills and all nations shall flow unto it and many people shall go and say come ye and let us go up to the mountain of the lord to the house of the god of jacob and he will teach us of his ways and we will walk in his paths for out of zion shall go forth the law and the word of the lord from jerusalem and he shall judge among the nations and shall rebuke many people and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruninghooks nation shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall they learn war any more o house of jacob come ye and let us walk in the light of the lord therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of jacob because they be replenished from the east and are soothsayers like the philistines and they please themselves in the children of strangers their land also is full of silver and gold neither is there any end of their treasures their land is also full of horses neither is there any end of their chariots their land also is full of idols they worship the work of their own hands that which their own fingers have made and the mean man boweth down and the great man humbleth himself therefore forgive them not enter into the rock and hide thee in the dust for fear of the lord and for the glory of his majesty the lofty looks of man shall be humbled and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down and the lord alone shall be exalted in that day for the day of the lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty and upon every one that is lifted up and he shall be brought low and upon all the cedars of lebanon that are high and lifted up and upon all the oaks of bashan
