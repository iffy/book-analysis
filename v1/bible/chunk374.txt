like grass of the earth his name shall endure for ever his name shall be continued as long as the sun and men shall be blessed in him all nations shall call him blessed blessed be the lord god the god of israel who only doeth wondrous things and blessed be his glorious name for ever and let the whole earth be filled with his glory amen and amen the prayers of david the son of jesse are ended truly god is good to israel even to such as are of a clean heart but as for me my feet were almost gone my steps had well nigh slipped for i was envious at the foolish when i saw the prosperity of the wicked for there are no bands in their death but their strength is firm they are not in trouble as other men neither are they plagued like other men therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain violence covereth them as a garment their eyes stand out with fatness they have more than heart could wish they are corrupt and speak wickedly concerning oppression they speak loftily they set their mouth against the heavens and their tongue walketh through the earth therefore his people return hither and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them and they say how doth god know and is there knowledge in the most high behold these are the ungodly who prosper in the world they increase in riches verily i have cleansed my heart in vain and washed my hands in innocency for all the day long have i been plagued and chastened every morning if i say i will speak thus behold i should offend against the generation of thy children when i thought to know this it was too painful for me until i went into the sanctuary of god then understood i their end surely thou didst set them in slippery places thou castedst them down into destruction how are they brought into desolation as in a moment they are utterly consumed with terrors as a dream when one awaketh so o lord when thou awakest thou shalt despise their image thus my heart was grieved and i was pricked in my reins so foolish was i and ignorant i was as a beast before thee nevertheless i am continually with thee thou hast holden me by my right hand thou shalt guide me with thy counsel and afterward receive me to glory whom have i in heaven but thee and there is none upon earth that i desire beside thee my flesh and my heart faileth but god is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever for lo they that are far from thee shall perish thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee but it is good for me to draw near to god i have put my trust in the lord god that i may declare all thy works o god why hast thou cast us off for ever why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture remember thy congregation which thou hast purchased of old the rod of thine inheritance which thou hast redeemed this mount zion wherein thou hast dwelt lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations they set up their ensigns for signs a man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees but now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers they have cast fire into thy sanctuary they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground they said in their hearts let us destroy them together they have burned up all the synagogues of god in the land we see not our signs there is no more any prophet neither is there among us any that knoweth how long o god how long shall the adversary reproach shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever why withdrawest thou thy hand even thy right hand pluck it out of thy bosom for god is my king of old working salvation in the midst of the earth thou didst divide the sea by thy strength thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood thou driedst up mighty rivers the day is thine the night also is thine thou hast prepared the light and the sun thou hast set all the borders of the earth thou hast made summer and winter remember this that the enemy hath reproached o lord and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name o deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever have respect unto the covenant for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty o let not the oppressed return ashamed let the poor and needy praise thy name arise o god plead thine own cause remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily forget not the voice of thine enemies the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually unto thee o god do we give thanks unto thee do we give thanks for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare when i shall receive the congregation i will judge uprightly the earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved i bear up the pillars of it selah i said unto the fools deal not foolishly and to the wicked lift not up the horn lift not up your horn on high speak not with a stiff neck for promotion cometh neither from the east nor from the west nor from the south but god is the judge he putteth down one and setteth up another for in the hand of the lord there is a cup and the wine is red it is full of mixture and he poureth out of the same but the dregs thereof all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out and drink
