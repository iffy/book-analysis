shall make him afraid fear thou not o jacob my servant saith the lord for i am with thee for i will make a full end of all the nations whither i have driven thee but i will not make a full end of thee but correct thee in measure yet will i not leave thee wholly unpunished the word of the lord that came to jeremiah the prophet against the philistines before that pharaoh smote gaza thus saith the lord behold waters rise up out of the north and shall be an overflowing flood and shall overflow the land and all that is therein the city and them that dwell therein then the men shall cry and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl at the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses at the rushing of his chariots and at the rumbling of his wheels the fathers shall not look back to their children for feebleness of hands because of the day that cometh to spoil all the philistines and to cut off from tyrus and zidon every helper that remaineth for the lord will spoil the philistines the remnant of the country of caphtor baldness is come upon gaza ashkelon is cut off with the remnant of their valley how long wilt thou cut thyself o thou sword of the lord how long will it be ere thou be quiet put up thyself into thy scabbard rest and be still how can it be quiet seeing the lord hath given it a charge against ashkelon and against the sea shore there hath he appointed it against moab thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel woe unto nebo for it is spoiled kiriathaim is confounded and taken misgab is confounded and dismayed there shall be no more praise of moab in heshbon they have devised evil against it come and let us cut it off from being a nation also thou shalt be cut down o madmen the sword shall pursue thee a voice of crying shall be from horonaim spoiling and great destruction moab is destroyed her little ones have caused a cry to be heard for in the going up of luhith continual weeping shall go up for in the going down of horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction flee save your lives and be like the heath in the wilderness for because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures thou shalt also be taken and chemosh shall go forth into captivity with his priests and his princes together and the spoiler shall come upon every city and no city shall escape the valley also shall perish and the plain shall be destroyed as the lord hath spoken give wings unto moab that it may flee and get away for the cities thereof shall be desolate without any to dwell therein cursed be he that doeth the work of the lord deceitfully and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood moab hath been at ease from his youth and he hath settled on his lees and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel neither hath he gone into captivity therefore his taste remained in him and his scent is not changed therefore behold the days come saith the lord that i will send unto him wanderers that shall cause him to wander and shall empty his vessels and break their bottles and moab shall be ashamed of chemosh as the house of israel was ashamed of bethel their confidence how say ye we are mighty and strong men for the war moab is spoiled and gone up out of her cities and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter saith the king whose name is the lord of hosts the calamity of moab is near to come and his affliction hasteth fast all ye that are about him bemoan him and all ye that know his name say how is the strong staff broken and the beautiful rod thou daughter that dost inhabit dibon come down from thy glory and sit in thirst for the spoiler of moab shall come upon thee and he shall destroy thy strong holds o inhabitant of aroer stand by the way and espy ask him that fleeth and her that escapeth and say what is done moab is confounded for it is broken down howl and cry tell ye it in arnon that moab is spoiled and judgment is come upon the plain country upon holon and upon jahazah and upon mephaath and upon dibon and upon nebo and upon bethdiblathaim and upon kiriathaim and upon bethgamul and upon bethmeon and upon kerioth and upon bozrah and upon all the cities of the land of moab far or near the horn of moab is cut off and his arm is broken saith the lord make ye him drunken for he magnified himself against the lord moab also shall wallow in his vomit and he also shall be in derision for was not israel a derision unto thee was he found among thieves for since thou spakest of him thou skippedst for joy o ye that dwell in moab leave the cities and dwell in the rock and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the holes mouth we have heard the pride of moab he is exceeding proud his loftiness and his arrogancy and his pride and the haughtiness of his heart i know his wrath saith the lord but it shall not be so his lies shall not so effect it therefore will i howl for moab and i will cry out for all moab mine heart shall mourn for the men of kirheres o vine of sibmah i will weep for thee with the weeping of jazer thy plants are gone over the sea they reach even to the sea of jazer the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage and joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field and from the land of moab and i have caused wine to fail from the winepresses none shall tread with shouting their shouting shall be no shouting from the cry of heshbon even unto elealeh and even unto jahaz have they uttered their voice from zoar
