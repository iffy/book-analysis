as did the house of ahab for he had the daughter of ahab to wife and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the lord howbeit the lord would not destroy the house of david because of the covenant that he had made with david and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever in his days the edomites revolted from under the dominion of judah and made themselves a king then jehoram went forth with his princes and all his chariots with him and he rose up by night and smote the edomites which compassed him in and the captains of the chariots so the edomites revolted from under the hand of judah unto this day the same time also did libnah revolt from under his hand because he had forsaken the lord god of his fathers moreover he made high places in the mountains of judah and caused the inhabitants of jerusalem to commit fornication and compelled judah thereto and there came a writing to him from elijah the prophet saying thus saith the lord god of david thy father because thou hast not walked in the ways of jehoshaphat thy father nor in the ways of asa king of judah but hast walked in the way of the kings of israel and hast made judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem to go a whoring like to the whoredoms of the house of ahab and also hast slain thy brethren of thy fathers house which were better than thyself behold with a great plague will the lord smite thy people and thy children and thy wives and all thy goods and thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day moreover the lord stirred up against jehoram the spirit of the philistines and of the arabians that were near the ethiopians and they came up into judah and brake into it and carried away all the substance that was found in the kings house and his sons also and his wives so that there was never a son left him save jehoahaz the youngest of his sons and after all this the lord smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease and it came to pass that in process of time after the end of two years his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness so he died of sore diseases and his people made no burning for him like the burning of his fathers thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned in jerusalem eight years and departed without being desired howbeit they buried him in the city of david but not in the sepulchres of the kings and the inhabitants of jerusalem made ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead for the band of men that came with the arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest so ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah reigned forty and two years old was ahaziah when he began to reign and he reigned one year in jerusalem his mothers name also was athaliah the daughter of omri he also walked in the ways of the house of ahab for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly wherefore he did evil in the sight of the lord like the house of ahab for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to his destruction he walked also after their counsel and went with jehoram the son of ahab king of israel to war against hazael king of syria at ramothgilead and the syrians smote joram and he returned to be healed in jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at ramah when he fought with hazael king of syria and azariah the son of jehoram king of judah went down to see jehoram the son of ahab at jezreel because he was sick and the destruction of ahaziah was of god by coming to joram for when he was come he went out with jehoram against jehu the son of nimshi whom the lord had anointed to cut off the house of ahab and it came to pass that when jehu was executing judgment upon the house of ahab and found the princes of judah and the sons of the brethren of ahaziah that ministered to ahaziah he slew them and he sought ahaziah and they caught him for he was hid in samaria and brought him to jehu and when they had slain him they buried him because said they he is the son of jehoshaphat who sought the lord with all his heart so the house of ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom but when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son was dead she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of judah but jehoshabeath the daughter of the king took joash the son of ahaziah and stole him from among the kings sons that were slain and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber so jehoshabeath the daughter of king jehoram the wife of jehoiada the priest for she was the sister of ahaziah hid him from athaliah so that she slew him not and he was with them hid in the house of god six years and athaliah reigned over the land and in the seventh year jehoiada strengthened himself and took the captains of hundreds azariah the son of jeroham and ishmael the son of jehohanan and azariah the son of obed and maaseiah the son of adaiah and elishaphat the son of zichri into covenant with him and they went about in judah and gathered the levites out of all the cities of judah and the chief of the fathers of israel and they came to jerusalem and all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of god and he said unto them behold the kings son shall reign as the lord hath said of the sons of david this is the thing that ye shall do a third part of you entering on the sabbath of the priests and of the levites shall be porters of the doors and a third part shall be at
