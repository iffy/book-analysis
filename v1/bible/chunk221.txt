arose and all the people that were with him and they passed over jordan by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over jordan and when ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed he saddled his ass and arose and gat him home to his house to his city and put his household in order and hanged himself and died and was buried in the sepulchre of his father then david came to mahanaim and absalom passed over jordan he and all the men of israel with him and absalom made amasa captain of the host instead of joab which amasa was a mans son whose name was ithra an israelite that went in to abigail the daughter of nahash sister to zeruiah joabs mother so israel and absalom pitched in the land of gilead and it came to pass when david was come to mahanaim that shobi the son of nahash of rabbah of the children of ammon and machir the son of ammiel of lodebar and barzillai the gileadite of rogelim brought beds and basons and earthen vessels and wheat and barley and flour and parched corn and beans and lentiles and parched pulse and honey and butter and sheep and cheese of kine for david and for the people that were with him to eat for they said the people is hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness and david numbered the people that were with him and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them and david sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of joab and a third part under the hand of abishai the son of zeruiah joabs brother and a third part under the hand of ittai the gittite and the king said unto the people i will surely go forth with you myself also but the people answered thou shalt not go forth for if we flee away they will not care for us neither if half of us die will they care for us but now thou art worth ten thousand of us therefore now it is better that thou succour us out of the city and the king said unto them what seemeth you best i will do and the king stood by the gate side and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands and the king commanded joab and abishai and ittai saying deal gently for my sake with the young man even with absalom and all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning absalom so the people went out into the field against israel and the battle was in the wood of ephraim where the people of israel were slain before the servants of david and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men for the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured and absalom met the servants of david and absalom rode upon a mule and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak and his head caught hold of the oak and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth and the mule that was under him went away and a certain man saw it and told joab and said behold i saw absalom hanged in an oak and joab said unto the man that told him and behold thou sawest him and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground and i would have given thee ten shekels of silver and a girdle and the man said unto joab though i should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand yet would i not put forth mine hand against the kings son for in our hearing the king charged thee and abishai and ittai saying beware that none touch the young man absalom otherwise i should have wrought falsehood against mine own life for there is no matter hid from the king and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me then said joab i may not tarry thus with thee and he took three darts in his hand and thrust them through the heart of absalom while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak and ten young men that bare joabs armour compassed about and smote absalom and slew him and joab blew the trumpet and the people returned from pursuing after israel for joab held back the people and they took absalom and cast him into a great pit in the wood and laid a very great heap of stones upon him and all israel fled every one to his tent now absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar which is in the kings dale for he said i have no son to keep my name in remembrance and he called the pillar after his own name and it is called unto this day absaloms place then said ahimaaz the son of zadok let me now run and bear the king tidings how that the lord hath avenged him of his enemies and joab said unto him thou shalt not bear tidings this day but thou shalt bear tidings another day but this day thou shalt bear no tidings because the kings son is dead then said joab to cushi go tell the king what thou hast seen and cushi bowed himself unto joab and ran then said ahimaaz the son of zadok yet again to joab but howsoever let me i pray thee also run after cushi and joab said wherefore wilt thou run my son seeing that thou hast no tidings ready but howsoever said he let me run and he said unto him run then ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain and overran cushi and david sat between the two gates and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall and lifted up his eyes and looked and behold a man running alone and the watchman cried and told the king and the king said if he be alone there is tidings in his mouth and he came apace and drew near and the watchman saw another man running and the watchman
