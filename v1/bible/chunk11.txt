hath found grace in thy sight and thou hast magnified thy mercy which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life and i cannot escape to the mountain lest some evil take me and i die behold now this city is near to flee unto and it is a little one oh let me escape thither is it not a little one and my soul shall live and he said unto him see i have accepted thee concerning this thing also that i will not overthrow this city for the which thou hast spoken haste thee escape thither for i cannot do anything till thou be come thither therefore the name of the city was called zoar the sun was risen upon the earth when lot entered into zoar then the lord rained upon sodom and upon gomorrah brimstone and fire from the lord out of heaven and he overthrew those cities and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities and that which grew upon the ground but his wife looked back from behind him and she became a pillar of salt and abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the lord and he looked toward sodom and gomorrah and toward all the land of the plain and beheld and lo the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace and it came to pass when god destroyed the cities of the plain that god remembered abraham and sent lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in the which lot dwelt and lot went up out of zoar and dwelt in the mountain and his two daughters with him for he feared to dwell in zoar and he dwelt in a cave he and his two daughters and the firstborn said unto the younger our father is old and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth come let us make our father drink wine and we will lie with him that we may preserve seed of our father and they made their father drink wine that night and the firstborn went in and lay with her father and he perceived not when she lay down nor when she arose and it came to pass on the morrow that the firstborn said unto the younger behold i lay yesternight with my father let us make him drink wine this night also and go thou in and lie with him that we may preserve seed of our father and they made their father drink wine that night also and the younger arose and lay with him and he perceived not when she lay down nor when she arose thus were both the daughters of lot with child by their father and the first born bare a son and called his name moab the same is the father of the moabites unto this day and the younger she also bare a son and called his name benammi the same is the father of the children of ammon unto this day and abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country and dwelled between kadesh and shur and sojourned in gerar and abraham said of sarah his wife she is my sister and abimelech king of gerar sent and took sarah but god came to abimelech in a dream by night and said to him behold thou art but a dead man for the woman which thou hast taken for she is a mans wife but abimelech had not come near her and he said lord wilt thou slay also a righteous nation said he not unto me she is my sister and she even she herself said he is my brother in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have i done this and god said unto him in a dream yea i know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart for i also withheld thee from sinning against me therefore suffered i thee not to touch her now therefore restore the man his wife for he is a prophet and he shall pray for thee and thou shalt live and if thou restore her not know thou that thou shalt surely die thou and all that are thine therefore abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told all these things in their ears and the men were sore afraid then abimelech called abraham and said unto him what hast thou done unto us and what have i offended thee that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done and abimelech said unto abraham what sawest thou that thou hast done this thing and abraham said because i thought surely the fear of god is not in this place and they will slay me for my wifes sake and yet indeed she is my sister she is the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother and she became my wife and it came to pass when god caused me to wander from my fathers house that i said unto her this is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me at every place whither we shall come say of me he is my brother and abimelech took sheep and oxen and menservants and womenservants and gave them unto abraham and restored him sarah his wife and abimelech said behold my land is before thee dwell where it pleaseth thee and unto sarah he said behold i have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver behold he is to thee a covering of the eyes unto all that are with thee and with all other thus she was reproved so abraham prayed unto god and god healed abimelech and his wife and his maidservants and they bare children for the lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of abimelech because of sarah abrahams wife and the lord visited sarah as he had said and the lord did unto sarah as he had spoken for sarah conceived and bare abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which god had spoken
