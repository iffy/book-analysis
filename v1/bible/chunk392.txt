for his mercy endureth for ever and made israel to pass through the midst of it for his mercy endureth for ever but overthrew pharaoh and his host in the red sea for his mercy endureth for ever to him which led his people through the wilderness for his mercy endureth for ever to him which smote great kings for his mercy endureth for ever and slew famous kings for his mercy endureth for ever sihon king of the amorites for his mercy endureth for ever and og the king of bashan for his mercy endureth for ever and gave their land for an heritage for his mercy endureth for ever even an heritage unto israel his servant for his mercy endureth for ever who remembered us in our low estate for his mercy endureth for ever and hath redeemed us from our enemies for his mercy endureth for ever who giveth food to all flesh for his mercy endureth for ever o give thanks unto the god of heaven for his mercy endureth for ever by the rivers of babylon there we sat down yea we wept when we remembered zion we hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof for there they that carried us away captive required of us a song and they that wasted us required of us mirth saying sing us one of the songs of zion how shall we sing the lords song in a strange land if i forget thee o jerusalem let my right hand forget her cunning if i do not remember thee let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if i prefer not jerusalem above my chief joy remember o lord the children of edom in the day of jerusalem who said rase it rase it even to the foundation thereof o daughter of babylon who art to be destroyed happy shall he be that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us happy shall he be that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones i will praise thee with my whole heart before the gods will i sing praise unto thee i will worship toward thy holy temple and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name in the day when i cried thou answeredst me and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul all the kings of the earth shall praise thee o lord when they hear the words of thy mouth yea they shall sing in the ways of the lord for great is the glory of the lord though the lord be high yet hath he respect unto the lowly but the proud he knoweth afar off though i walk in the midst of trouble thou wilt revive me thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies and thy right hand shall save me the lord will perfect that which concerneth me thy mercy o lord endureth for ever forsake not the works of thine own hands o lord thou hast searched me and known me thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising thou understandest my thought afar off thou compassest my path and my lying down and art acquainted with all my ways for there is not a word in my tongue but lo o lord thou knowest it altogether thou hast beset me behind and before and laid thine hand upon me such knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high i cannot attain unto it whither shall i go from thy spirit or whither shall i flee from thy presence if i ascend up into heaven thou art there if i make my bed in hell behold thou art there if i take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me if i say surely the darkness shall cover me even the night shall be light about me yea the darkness hideth not from thee but the night shineth as the day the darkness and the light are both alike to thee for thou hast possessed my reins thou hast covered me in my mothers womb i will praise thee for i am fearfully and wonderfully made marvellous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well my substance was not hid from thee when i was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them how precious also are thy thoughts unto me o god how great is the sum of them if i should count them they are more in number than the sand when i awake i am still with thee surely thou wilt slay the wicked o god depart from me therefore ye bloody men for they speak against thee wickedly and thine enemies take thy name in vain do not i hate them o lord that hate thee and am not i grieved with those that rise up against thee i hate them with perfect hatred i count them mine enemies search me o god and know my heart try me and know my

continually are they gathered together for war they have sharpened their tongues like a serpent adders poison is under their lips selah keep me o lord from the hands of the wicked preserve me from the violent man who have purposed to overthrow my goings the proud have hid a snare for me and cords they have spread a net by the wayside they have set gins for me selah i said unto the lord thou art my god hear the voice of my supplications o
