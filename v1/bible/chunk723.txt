of noah while the ark was a preparing wherein few that is eight souls were saved by water the like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good conscience toward god by the resurrection of jesus christ who is gone into heaven and is on the right hand of god angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him forasmuch then as christ hath suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men but to the will of god for the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the gentiles when we walked in lasciviousness lusts excess of wine revellings banquetings and abominable idolatries wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot speaking evil of you who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead for for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead that they might be judged according to men in the flesh but live according to god in the spirit but the end of all things is at hand be ye therefore sober and watch unto prayer and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins use hospitality one to another without grudging as every man hath received the gift even so minister the same one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of god if any man speak let him speak as the oracles of god if any man minister let him do it as of the ability which god giveth that god in all things may be glorified through jesus christ to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever amen beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you but rejoice inasmuch as ye are partakers of christs sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding joy if ye be reproached for the name of christ happy are ye for the spirit of glory and of god resteth upon you on their part he is evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified but let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an evildoer or as a busybody in other mens matters yet if any man suffer as a christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify god on this behalf for the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of god and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of god and if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of god commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing as unto a faithful creator the elders which are among you i exhort who am also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed feed the flock of god which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly not for filthy lucre but of a ready mind neither as being lords over gods heritage but being ensamples to the flock and when the chief shepherd shall appear ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the elder yea all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for god resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he careth for you be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resist stedfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the god of all grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by christ jesus after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect stablish strengthen settle you to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever amen by silvanus a faithful brother unto you as i suppose i have written briefly exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of god wherein ye stand the church that is at babylon elected together with you saluteth you and so doth marcus my son greet ye one another with a kiss of charity peace be with you all that are in christ jesus amen the second general epistle of peter simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our saviour jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye

knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you

his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make
