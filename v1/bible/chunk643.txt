was come from god and went to god he riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself after that he poureth water into a bason and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to simon peter and peter saith unto him lord dost thou wash my feet jesus answered and said unto him what i do thou knowest not now but thou shalt know hereafter peter saith unto him thou shalt never wash my feet jesus answered him if i wash thee not thou hast no part with me simon peter saith unto him lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head jesus saith to him he that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet but is clean every whit and ye are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know ye what i have done to you ye call me master and lord and ye say well for so i am if i then your lord and master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one anothers feet for i have given you an example that ye should do as i have done to you verily verily i say unto you the servant is not greater than his lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if ye know these things happy are ye if ye do them i speak not of you all i know whom i have chosen but that the scripture may be fulfilled he that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me now i tell you before it come that when it is come to pass ye may believe that i am he verily verily i say unto you he that receiveth whomsoever i send receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me when jesus had thus said he was troubled in spirit and testified and said verily verily i say unto you that one of you shall betray me then the disciples looked one on another doubting of whom he spake now there was leaning on jesus bosom one of his disciples whom jesus loved simon peter therefore beckoned to him that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake he then lying on jesus breast saith unto him lord who is it jesus answered he it is to whom i shall give a sop when i have dipped it and when he had dipped the sop he gave it to judas iscariot the son of simon and after the sop satan entered into him then said jesus unto him that thou doest do quickly now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him for some of them thought because judas had the bag that jesus had said unto him buy those things that we have need of against the feast or that he should give something to the poor he then having received the sop went immediately out and it was night therefore when he was gone out jesus said now is the son of man glorified and god is glorified in him if god be glorified in him god shall also glorify him in himself and shall straightway glorify him little children yet a little while i am with you ye shall seek me and as i said unto the jews whither i go ye cannot come so now i say to you a new commandment i give unto you that ye love one another as i have loved you that ye also love one another by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another simon peter said unto him lord whither goest thou jesus answered him whither i go thou canst not follow me now but thou shalt follow me afterwards peter said unto him lord why cannot i follow thee now i will lay down my life for thy sake jesus answered him wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake verily verily i say unto thee the cock shall not crow till thou hast denied me thrice let not your heart be troubled ye believe in god believe also in me in my fathers house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there ye may be also and whither i go ye know and the way ye know thomas saith unto him lord we know not whither thou goest and how can we know the way jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me if ye had known me ye should have known my father also and from henceforth ye know him and have seen him philip saith unto him lord shew us the father and it sufficeth us jesus saith unto him have i been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me philip he that hath seen me hath seen the father and how sayest thou then shew us the father believest thou not that i am in the father and the father in me the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works believe me that i am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very works sake verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because i go unto my father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son if ye shall ask any thing in my name i will do it
