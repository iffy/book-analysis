that believe but to them that believe not but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not but for them which believe if therefore the whole church be come together into one place and all speak with tongues and there come in those that are unlearned or unbelievers will they not say that ye are mad but if all prophesy and there come in one that believeth not or one unlearned he is convinced of all he is judged of all and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest and so falling down on his face he will worship god and report that god is in you of a truth how is it then brethren when ye come together every one of you hath a psalm hath a doctrine hath a tongue hath a revelation hath an interpretation let all things be done unto edifying if any man speak in an unknown tongue let it be by two or at the most by three and that by course and let one interpret but if there be no interpreter let him keep silence in the church and let him speak to himself and to god let the prophets speak two or three and let the other judge if any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by let the first hold his peace for ye may all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be comforted and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets for god is not the author of confusion but of peace as in all churches of the saints let your women keep silence in the churches for it is not permitted unto them to speak but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law and if they will learn any thing let them ask their husbands at home for it is a shame for women to speak in the church what came the word of god out from you or came it unto you only if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that i write unto you are the commandments of the lord but if any man be ignorant let him be ignorant wherefore brethren covet to prophesy and forbid not to speak with tongues let all things be done decently and in order moreover brethren i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you which also ye have received and wherein ye stand by which also ye are saved if ye keep in memory what i preached unto you unless ye have believed in vain for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures and that he was seen of cephas then of the twelve after that he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once of whom the greater part remain unto this present but some are fallen asleep after that he was seen of james then of all the apostles and last of all he was seen of me also as of one born out of due time for i am the least of the apostles that am not meet to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but i laboured more abundantly than they all yet not i but the grace of god which was with me therefore whether it were i or they so we preach and so ye believed now if christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead but if there be no resurrection of the dead then is christ not risen and if christ be not risen then is our preaching vain and your faith is also vain yea and we are found false witnesses of god because we have testified of god that he raised up christ whom he raised not up if so be that the dead rise not for if the dead rise not then is not christ raised and if christ be not raised your faith is vain ye are yet in your sins then they also which are fallen asleep in christ are perished if in this life only we have hope in christ we are of all men most miserable but now is christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive but every man in his own order christ the firstfruits afterward they that are christs at his coming then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to god even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power for he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death for he hath put all things under his feet but when he saith all things are put under him it is manifest that he is excepted which did put all things under him and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that god may be all in all else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead if the dead rise not at all why are they then baptized for the dead and why stand we in jeopardy every hour i protest by your rejoicing which i have in christ jesus our lord i die daily if after the manner of men i have fought with beasts at ephesus what advantageth it me if the dead rise not let us eat and drink for to morrow we die be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners awake to righteousness and sin not for some have not the knowledge of god i speak this to your shame but
