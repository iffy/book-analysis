garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth so the lord god will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations for zions sake will i not hold my peace and for jerusalems sake i will not rest until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth and the gentiles shall see thy righteousness and all kings thy glory and thou shalt be called by a new name which the mouth of the lord shall name thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the lord and a royal diadem in the hand of thy god thou shalt no more be termed forsaken neither shall thy land any more be termed desolate but thou shalt be called hephzibah and thy land beulah for the lord delighteth in thee and thy land shall be married for as a young man marrieth a virgin so shall thy sons marry thee and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride so shall thy god rejoice over thee i have set watchmen upon thy walls o jerusalem which shall never hold their peace day nor night ye that make mention of the lord keep not silence and give him no rest till he establish and till he make jerusalem a praise in the earth the lord hath sworn by his right hand and by the arm of his strength surely i will no more give thy corn to be meat for thine enemies and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine for the which thou hast laboured but they that have gathered it shall eat it and praise the lord and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness go through go through the gates prepare ye the way of the people cast up cast up the highway gather out the stones lift up a standard for the people behold the lord hath proclaimed unto the end of the world say ye to the daughter of zion behold thy salvation cometh behold his reward is with him and his work before him and they shall call them the holy people the redeemed of the lord and thou shalt be called sought out a city not forsaken who is this that cometh from edom with dyed garments from bozrah this that is glorious in his apparel travelling in the greatness of his strength i that speak in righteousness mighty to save wherefore art thou red in thine apparel and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat i have trodden the winepress alone and of the people there was none with me for i will tread them in mine anger and trample them in my fury and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments and i will stain all my raiment for the day of vengeance is in mine heart and the year of my redeemed is come and i looked and there was none to help and i wondered that there was none to uphold therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me and my fury it upheld me and i will tread down the people in mine anger and make them drunk in my fury and i will bring down their strength to the earth i will mention the lovingkindnesses of the lord and the praises of the lord according to all that the lord hath bestowed on us and the great goodness toward the house of israel which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses for he said surely they are my people children that will not lie so he was their saviour in all their affliction he was afflicted and the angel of his presence saved them in his love and in his pity he redeemed them and he bare them and carried them all the days of old but they rebelled and vexed his holy spirit therefore he was turned to be their enemy and he fought against them then he remembered the days of old moses and
