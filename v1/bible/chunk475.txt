not hearkened to receive instruction but they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name to defile it and they built the high places of baal which are in the valley of the son of hinnom to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto molech which i commanded them not neither came it into my mind that they should do this abomination to cause judah to sin and now therefore thus saith the lord the god of israel concerning this city whereof ye say it shall be delivered into the hand of the king of babylon by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence behold i will gather them out of all countries whither i have driven them in mine anger and in my fury and in great wrath and i will bring them again unto this place and i will cause them to dwell safely and they shall be my people and i will be their god and i will give them one heart and one way that they may fear me for ever for the good of them and of their children after them and i will make an everlasting covenant with them that i will not turn away from them to do them good but i will put my fear in their hearts that they shall not depart from me yea i will rejoice over them to do them good and i will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul for thus saith the lord like as i have brought all this great evil upon this people so will i bring upon them all the good that i have promised them and fields shall be bought in this land whereof ye say it is desolate without man or beast it is given into the hand of the chaldeans men shall buy fields for money and subscribe evidences and seal them and take witnesses in the land of benjamin and in the places about jerusalem and in the cities of judah and in the cities of the mountains and in the cities of the valley and in the cities of the south for i will cause their captivity to return saith the lord moreover the word of the lord came unto jeremiah the second time while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison saying thus saith the lord the maker thereof the lord that formed it to establish it the lord is his name call unto me and i will answer thee and shew thee great and mighty things which thou knowest not for thus saith the lord the god of israel concerning the houses of this city and concerning the houses of the kings of judah which are thrown down by the mounts and by the sword they come to fight with the chaldeans but it is to fill them with the dead bodies of men whom i have slain in mine anger and in my fury and for all whose wickedness i have hid my face from this city behold i will bring it health and cure and i will cure them and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth and i will cause the captivity of judah and the captivity of israel to return and will build them as at the first and i will cleanse them from all their iniquity whereby they have sinned against me and i will pardon all their iniquities whereby they have sinned and whereby they have transgressed against me and it shall be to me a name of joy a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth which shall hear all the good that i do unto them and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that i procure unto it thus saith the lord again there shall be heard in this place which ye say shall be desolate without man and without beast even in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem that are desolate without man and without inhabitant and without beast the voice of joy and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride the voice of them that shall say praise the lord of hosts for the lord is good for his mercy endureth for ever and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the lord for i will cause to return the captivity of the land as at the first saith the lord thus saith the lord of hosts again in this place which is desolate without man and without beast and in all the cities thereof shall be an habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down in the cities of the mountains in the cities of the vale and in the cities of the south and in the land of benjamin and in the places about jerusalem and in the cities of judah shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth them saith the lord behold the days come saith the lord that i will perform that good thing which i have promised unto the house of israel and to the house of judah in those days and at that time will i cause the branch of righteousness to grow up unto david and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land in those days shall judah be saved and jerusalem shall dwell safely and this is the name wherewith she shall be called the lord our righteousness for thus saith the lord david shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of israel neither shall the priests the levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings and to kindle meat offerings and to do sacrifice continually and the word of the lord came unto jeremiah saying thus saith the lord if ye can break my covenant of the day and my covenant of the night and that there should not be day and night in their season then may also my covenant be broken with david my servant that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne and with
