and to cause to perish all the power of the people and province that would assault them both little ones and women and to take the spoil of them for a prey upon one day in all the provinces of king ahasuerus namely upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month which is the month adar the copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people and that the jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies so the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out being hastened and pressed on by the kings commandment and the decree was given at shushan the palace and mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white and with a great crown of gold and with a garment of fine linen and purple and the city of shushan rejoiced and was glad the jews had light and gladness and joy and honour and in every province and in every city whithersoever the kings commandment and his decree came the jews had joy and gladness a feast and a good day and many of the people of the land became jews for the fear of the jews fell upon them now in the twelfth month that is the month adar on the thirteenth day of the same when the kings commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution in the day that the enemies of the jews hoped to have power over them though it was turned to the contrary that the jews had rule over them that hated them the jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king ahasuerus to lay hand on such as sought their hurt and no man could withstand them for the fear of them fell upon all people and all the rulers of the provinces and the lieutenants and the deputies and officers of the king helped the jews because the fear of mordecai fell upon them for mordecai was great in the kings house and his fame went out throughout all the provinces for this man mordecai waxed greater and greater thus the jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword and slaughter and destruction and did what they would unto those that hated them and in shushan the palace the jews slew and destroyed five hundred men and parshandatha and dalphon and aspatha and poratha and adalia and aridatha and parmashta and arisai and aridai and vajezatha the ten sons of haman the son of hammedatha the enemy of the jews slew they but on the spoil laid they not their hand on that day the number of those that were slain in shushan the palace was brought before the king and the king said unto esther the queen the jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in shushan the palace and the ten sons of haman what have they done in the rest of the kings provinces now what is thy petition and it shall be granted thee or what is thy request further and it shall be done then said esther if it please the king let it be granted to the jews which are in shushan to do to morrow also according unto this days decree and let hamans ten sons be hanged upon the gallows and the king commanded it so to be done and the decree was given at shushan and they hanged hamans ten sons for the jews that were in shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month adar and slew three hundred men at shushan but on the prey they laid not their hand but the other jews that were in the kings provinces gathered themselves together and stood for their lives and had rest from their enemies and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand but they laid not their hands on the prey on the thirteenth day of the month adar and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they and made it a day of feasting and gladness but the jews that were at shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof and on the fourteenth thereof and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness therefore the jews of the villages that dwelt in the unwalled towns made the fourteenth day of the month adar a day of gladness and feasting and a good day and of sending portions one to another and mordecai wrote these things and sent letters unto all the jews that were in all the provinces of the king ahasuerus both nigh and far to stablish this among them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month adar and the fifteenth day of the same yearly as the days wherein the jews rested from their enemies and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy and from mourning into a good day that they should make them days of feasting and joy and of sending portions one to another and gifts to the poor and the jews undertook to do as they had begun and as mordecai had written unto them because haman the son of hammedatha the agagite the enemy of all the jews had devised against the jews to destroy them and had cast pur that is the lot to consume them and to destroy them but when esther came before the king he commanded by letters that his wicked device which he devised against the jews should return upon his own head and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows wherefore they called these days purim after the name of pur therefore for all the words of this letter and of that which they had seen concerning this matter and which had come unto them the jews ordained and took upon them and upon their seed and upon all such as joined themselves unto them so as it should not fail that they would keep these two days according to their writing and according to their appointed time every year and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation every family
