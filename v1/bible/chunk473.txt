from the coasts of the earth and with them the blind and the lame the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together a great company shall return thither they shall come with weeping and with supplications will i lead them i will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way wherein they shall not stumble for i am a father to israel and ephraim is my firstborn hear the word of the lord o ye nations and declare it in the isles afar off and say he that scattered israel will gather him and keep him as a shepherd doth his flock for the lord hath redeemed jacob and ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he therefore they shall come and sing in the height of zion and shall flow together to the goodness of the lord for wheat and for wine and for oil and for the young of the flock and of the herd and their soul shall be as a watered garden and they shall not sorrow any more at all then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance both young men and old together for i will turn their mourning into joy and will comfort them and make them rejoice from their sorrow and i will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness saith the lord thus saith the lord a voice was heard in ramah lamentation and bitter weeping rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children because they were not thus saith the lord refrain thy voice from weeping and thine eyes from tears for thy work shall be rewarded saith the lord and they shall come again from the land of the enemy and there is hope in thine end saith the lord that thy children shall come again to their own border i have surely heard ephraim bemoaning himself thus thou hast chastised me and i was chastised as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke turn thou me and i shall be turned for thou art the lord my god surely after that i was turned i repented and after that i was instructed i smote upon my thigh i was ashamed yea even confounded because i did bear the reproach of my youth is ephraim my dear son is he a pleasant child for since i spake against him i do earnestly remember him still therefore my bowels are troubled for him i will surely have mercy upon him saith the lord set thee up waymarks make thee high heaps set thine heart toward the highway even the way which thou wentest turn again o virgin of israel turn again to these thy cities how long wilt thou go about o thou backsliding daughter for the lord hath created a new thing in the earth a woman shall compass a man thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel as yet they shall use this speech in the land of judah and in the cities thereof when i shall bring again their captivity the lord bless thee o habitation of justice and mountain of holiness and there shall dwell in judah itself and in all the cities thereof together husbandmen and they that go forth with flocks for i have satiated the weary soul and i have replenished every sorrowful soul upon this i awaked and beheld and my sleep was sweet unto me behold the days come saith the lord that i will sow the house of israel and the house of judah with the seed of man and with the seed of beast and it shall come to pass that like as i have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to throw down and to destroy and to afflict so will i watch over them to build and to plant saith the lord in those days they shall say no more the fathers have eaten a sour grape and the childrens teeth are set on edge but every one shall die for his own iniquity every man that eateth the sour grape his teeth shall be set on edge behold the days come saith the lord that i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day that i took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of egypt which my covenant they brake although i was an husband unto them saith the lord but this shall be the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord i will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be their god and they shall be my people and they shall teach no more every man his neighbour and every man his brother saying know the lord for they shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest of them saith the lord for i will forgive their iniquity and i will remember their sin no more thus saith the lord which giveth the sun for a light by day and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar the lord of hosts is his name if those ordinances depart from before me saith the lord then the seed of israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever thus saith the lord if heaven above can be measured and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath i will also cast off all the seed of israel for all that they have done saith the lord behold the days come saith the lord that the city shall be built to the lord from the tower of hananeel unto the gate of the corner and the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill gareb and shall compass about to goath and the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes and all the fields unto the brook of kidron unto the corner of the horse gate toward
