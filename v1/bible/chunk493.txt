behold o lord and consider to whom thou hast done this shall the women eat their fruit and children of a span long shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the lord the young and the old lie on the ground in the streets my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger thou hast killed and not pitied thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about so that in the day of the lords anger none escaped nor remained those that i have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed i am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath he hath led me and brought me into darkness but not into light surely against me is he turned he turneth his hand against me all the day my flesh and my skin hath he made old he hath broken my bones he hath builded against me and compassed me with gall and travail he hath set me in dark places as they that be dead of old he hath hedged me about that i cannot get out he hath made my chain heavy also when i cry and shout he shutteth out my prayer he hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone he hath made my paths crooked he was unto me as a bear lying in wait and as a lion in secret places he hath turned aside my ways and pulled me in pieces he hath made me desolate he hath bent his bow and set me as a mark for the arrow he hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins i was a derision to all my people and their song all the day he hath filled me with bitterness he hath made me drunken with wormwood he hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones he hath covered me with ashes and thou hast removed my soul far off from peace i forgat prosperity and i said my strength and my hope is perished from the lord remembering mine affliction and my misery the wormwood and the gall my soul hath them still in remembrance and is humbled in me this i recall to my mind therefore have i hope it is of the lords mercies that we are not consumed because his compassions fail not they are new every morning great is thy faithfulness the lord is my portion saith my soul therefore will i hope in him the lord is good unto them that wait for him to the soul that seeketh him it is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the lord it is good for a man that he bear the yoke of his youth he sitteth alone and keepeth silence because he hath borne it upon him he putteth his mouth in the dust if so be there may be hope he giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him he is filled full with reproach for the lord will not cast off for ever but though he cause grief yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies for he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men to crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth to turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most high to subvert a man in his cause the lord approveth not who is he that saith and it cometh to pass when the lord commandeth it not out of the mouth of the most high proceedeth not evil and good wherefore doth a living man complain a man for the punishment of his sins let us search and try our ways and turn again to the lord let us lift up our heart with our hands unto god in the heavens we have transgressed and have rebelled thou hast not pardoned thou hast covered with anger and persecuted us thou hast slain thou hast not pitied thou hast covered thyself with a cloud that our prayer should not pass through thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people all our enemies have opened their mouths against us fear and a snare is come upon us desolation and destruction mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people mine eye trickleth down and ceaseth not without any intermission till the lord look down and behold from heaven mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city mine enemies chased me sore like a bird without cause they have cut off my life in the dungeon and cast a stone upon me waters flowed over mine head then i said i am cut off i called upon thy name o lord out of the low dungeon thou hast heard my voice hide not thine ear at my breathing at my cry thou drewest near in the day that i called upon thee thou saidst fear not o lord thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul thou hast redeemed my life o lord thou hast seen my wrong judge thou my cause thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me thou hast heard their reproach o lord and all their imaginations against me the lips of those that rose up against me and their device against me all the day behold their sitting down and their rising up i am their musick render unto them a recompence o lord according to the work of their hands give them sorrow of heart thy curse unto them persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the lord how is the gold become dim how is the most fine gold changed the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street the precious sons of zion comparable to fine gold how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers the work of the hands of the potter even the sea monsters draw out the breast they give suck to their young ones the daughter of my people is become cruel like the ostriches in the
