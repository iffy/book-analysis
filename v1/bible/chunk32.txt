grieved nor angry with yourselves that ye sold me hither for god did send me before you to preserve life for these two years hath the famine been in the land and yet there are five years in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest and god sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance so now it was not you that sent me hither but god and he hath made me a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt haste ye and go up to my father and say unto him thus saith thy son joseph god hath made me lord of all egypt come down unto me tarry not and thou shalt dwell in the land of goshen and thou shalt be near unto me thou and thy children and thy childrens children and thy flocks and thy herds and all that thou hast and there will i nourish thee for yet there are five years of famine lest thou and thy household and all that thou hast come to poverty and behold your eyes see and the eyes of my brother benjamin that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you and ye shall tell my father of all my glory in egypt and of all that ye have seen and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither and he fell upon his brother benjamins neck and wept and benjamin wept upon his neck moreover he kissed all his brethren and wept upon them and after that his brethren talked with him and the fame thereof was heard in pharaohs house saying josephs brethren are come and it pleased pharaoh well and his servants and pharaoh said unto joseph say unto thy brethren this do ye lade your beasts and go get you unto the land of canaan and take your father and your households and come unto me and i will give you the good of the land of egypt and ye shall eat the fat of the land now thou art commanded this do ye take you wagons out of the land of egypt for your little ones and for your wives and bring your father and come also regard not your stuff for the good of all the land of egypt is yours and the children of israel did so and joseph gave them wagons according to the commandment of pharaoh and gave them provision for the way to all of them he gave each man changes of raiment but to benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of raiment and to his father he sent after this manner ten asses laden with the good things of egypt and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way so he sent his brethren away and they departed and he said unto them see that ye fall not out by the way and they went up out of egypt and came into the land of canaan unto jacob their father and told him saying joseph is yet alive and he is governor over all the land of egypt and jacobs heart fainted for he believed them not and they told him all the words of joseph which he had said unto them and when he saw the wagons which joseph had sent to carry him the spirit of jacob their father revived and israel said it is enough joseph my son is yet alive i will go and see him before i die and israel took his journey with all that he had and came to beersheba and offered sacrifices unto the god of his father isaac and god spake unto israel in the visions of the night and said jacob jacob and he said here am i and he said i am god the god of thy father fear not to go down into egypt for i will there make of thee a great nation i will go down with thee into egypt and i will also surely bring thee up again and joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes and jacob rose up from beersheba and the sons of israel carried jacob their father and
