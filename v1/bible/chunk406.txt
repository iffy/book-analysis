vessel for the finer take away the wicked from before the king and his throne shall be established in righteousness put not forth thyself in the presence of the king and stand not in the place of great men for better it is that it be said unto thee come up hither than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen go not forth hastily to strive lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself and discover not a secret to another lest he that heareth it put thee to shame and thine infamy turn not away a word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver as an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear as the cold of snow in the time of harvest so is a faithful messenger to them that send him for he refresheth the soul of his masters whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain by long forbearing is a prince persuaded and a soft tongue breaketh the bone hast thou found honey eat so much as is sufficient for thee lest thou be filled therewith and vomit it withdraw thy foot from thy neighbours house lest he be weary of thee and so hate thee a man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a maul and a sword and a sharp arrow confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth and a foot out of joint as he that taketh away a garment in cold weather and as vinegar upon nitre so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart if thine enemy be hungry give him bread to eat and if he be thirsty give him water to drink for thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head and the lord shall reward thee the north wind driveth away rain so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue it is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop than with a brawling woman and in a wide house as cold waters to a thirsty soul so is good news from a far country a righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain and a corrupt spring it is not good to eat much honey so for men to search their own glory is not glory he that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down and without walls as snow in summer and as rain in harvest so honour is not seemly for a fool as the bird by wandering as the swallow by flying so the curse causeless shall not come a whip for the horse a bridle for the ass and a rod for the fools back answer not a fool according to his folly lest thou also be like unto him answer a fool according to his folly lest he be wise in his own conceit he that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet and drinketh damage the legs of the lame are not equal so is a parable in the mouth of fools as he that bindeth a stone in a sling so is he that giveth honour to a fool as a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard so is a parable in the mouths of fools the great god that formed all things both rewardeth the fool and rewardeth transgressors as a dog returneth to his vomit so a fool returneth to his folly seest thou a man wise in his own conceit there is more hope of a fool than of him the slothful man saith there is a lion in the way a lion is in the streets as the door turneth upon his hinges so doth the slothful upon his bed the slothful hideth his hand in his bosom it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth the sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason he that passeth by and meddleth with strife belonging not to him is like one that taketh a dog by the ears as a mad man who casteth firebrands arrows and death so is the man that deceiveth his neighbour and saith am not i in sport where no wood is there the fire goeth out so where there is no talebearer the strife ceaseth as coals are to burning coals and wood to fire so is a contentious man to kindle strife the words of a talebearer are as wounds and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with silver dross he that hateth dissembleth with his lips and layeth up deceit within him when he speaketh fair believe him not for there are seven abominations in his heart whose hatred is covered by deceit his wickedness shall be shewed before the whole congregation whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein and he that rolleth a stone it will return upon him a lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it and a flattering mouth worketh ruin boast not thyself of to morrow for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth let another man praise thee and not thine own mouth a stranger and not thine own lips a stone is heavy and the sand weighty but a fools wrath is heavier than them both wrath is cruel and anger is outrageous but who is able to stand before envy open rebuke is better than secret love faithful are the wounds of a friend but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful the full soul loatheth an honeycomb but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet as a bird that wandereth from her nest so is a man that wandereth from his place ointment and perfume rejoice the heart so doth the sweetness of a mans friend by hearty counsel thine own friend and thy fathers friend forsake not neither go into thy brothers house in
