unto david he fell on his face and did reverence and david said mephibosheth and he answered behold thy servant and david said unto him fear not for i will surely shew thee kindness for jonathan thy fathers sake and will restore thee all the land of saul thy father and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually and he bowed himself and said what is thy servant that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as i am then the king called to ziba sauls servant and said unto him i have given unto thy masters son all that pertained to saul and to all his house thou therefore and thy sons and thy servants shall till the land for him and thou shalt bring in the fruits that thy masters son may have food to eat but mephibosheth thy masters son shall eat bread alway at my table now ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants then said ziba unto the king according to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant so shall thy servant do as for mephibosheth said the king he shall eat at my table as one of the kings sons and mephibosheth had a young son whose name was micha and all that dwelt in the house of ziba were servants unto mephibosheth so mephibosheth dwelt in jerusalem for he did eat continually at the kings table and was lame on both his feet and it came to pass after this that the king of the children of ammon died and hanun his son reigned in his stead then said david i will shew kindness unto hanun the son of nahash as his father shewed kindness unto me and david sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father and davids servants came into the land of the children of ammon and the princes of the children of ammon said unto hanun their lord thinkest thou that david doth honour thy father that he hath sent comforters unto thee hath not david rather sent his servants unto thee to search the city and to spy it out and to overthrow it wherefore hanun took davids servants and shaved off the one half of their beards and cut off their garments in the middle even to their buttocks and sent them away when they told it unto david he sent to meet them because the men were greatly ashamed and the king said tarry at jericho until your beards be grown and then return and when the children of ammon saw that they stank before david the children of ammon sent and hired the syrians of bethrehob and the syrians of zoba twenty thousand footmen and of king maacah a thousand men and of ishtob twelve thousand men and when david heard of it he sent joab and all the host of the mighty men and the children of ammon came out and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate and the syrians of zoba and of rehob and ishtob and maacah were by themselves in the field when joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind he chose of all the choice men of israel and put them in array against the syrians and the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of abishai his brother that he might put them in array against the children of ammon and he said if the syrians be too strong for me then thou shalt help me but if the children of ammon be too strong for thee then i will come and help thee be of good courage and let us play the men for our people and for the cities of our god and the lord do that which seemeth him good and joab drew nigh and the people that were with him unto the battle against the syrians and they fled before him and when the children of ammon saw that the syrians were fled then fled they also before abishai and entered into the city so joab returned from the children of ammon and came to jerusalem and when the syrians saw that they were smitten before israel they gathered themselves together and hadarezer sent and brought out the syrians that were beyond the river and they came to helam and shobach the captain of the host of hadarezer went before them and when it was told david he gathered all israel together and passed over jordan and came to helam and the syrians set themselves in array against david and fought with him and the syrians fled before israel and david slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the syrians and forty thousand horsemen and smote shobach the captain of their host who died there and when all the kings that were servants to hadarezer saw that they were smitten before israel they made peace with israel and served them so the syrians feared to help the children of ammon any more and it came to pass after the year was expired at the time when kings go forth to battle that david sent joab and his servants with him and all israel and they destroyed the children of ammon and besieged rabbah but david tarried still at jerusalem and it came to pass in an eveningtide that david arose from off his bed and walked upon the roof of the kings house and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself and the woman was very beautiful to look upon and david sent and enquired after the woman and one said is not this bathsheba the daughter of eliam the wife of uriah the hittite and david sent messengers and took her and she came in unto him and he lay with her for she was purified from her uncleanness and she returned unto her house and the woman conceived and sent and told david and said i am with child and david sent to joab saying send me uriah the hittite and joab sent uriah to david and when uriah was come unto him david demanded of him how joab did and how the people did and how the war prospered and david said to uriah go down to thy house and wash thy
