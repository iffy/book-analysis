and they that were with him said master the multitude throng thee and press thee and sayest thou who touched me and jesus said somebody hath touched me for i perceive that virtue is gone out of me and when the woman saw that she was not hid she came trembling and falling down before him she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately and he said unto her daughter be of good comfort thy faith hath made thee whole go in peace while he yet spake there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogues house saying to him thy daughter is dead trouble not the master but when jesus heard it he answered him saying fear not believe only and she shall be made whole and when he came into the house he suffered no man to go in save peter and james and john and the father and the mother of the maiden and all wept and bewailed her but he said weep not she is not dead but sleepeth and they laughed him to scorn knowing that she was dead and he put them all out and took her by the hand and called saying maid arise and her spirit came again and she arose straightway and he commanded to give her meat and her parents were astonished but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done then he called his twelve disciples together and gave them power and authority over all devils and to cure diseases and he sent them to preach the kingdom of god and to heal the sick and he said unto them take nothing for your journey neither staves nor scrip neither bread neither money neither have two coats apiece and whatsoever house ye enter into there abide and thence depart and whosoever will not receive you when ye go out of that city shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them and they departed and went through the towns preaching the gospel and healing every where now herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him and he was perplexed because that it was said of some that john was risen from the dead and of some that elias had appeared and of others that one of the old prophets was risen again and herod said john have i beheaded but who is this of whom i hear such things and he desired to see him and the apostles when they were returned told him all that they had done and he took them and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called bethsaida and the people when they knew it followed him and he received them and spake unto them of the kingdom of god and healed them that had need of healing and when the day began to wear away then came the twelve and said unto him send the multitude away that they may go into the towns and country round about and lodge and get victuals for we are here in a desert place but he said unto them give ye them to eat and they said we have no more but five loaves and two fishes except we should go and buy meat for all this people for they were about five thousand men and he said to his disciples make them sit down by fifties in a company and they did so and made them all sit down then he took the five loaves and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he blessed them and brake and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude and they did eat and were all filled and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets and it came to pass as he was alone praying his disciples were with him and he asked them saying whom say the people that i am they answering said john the baptist but some say elias and others say that one of the old prophets is risen again he said unto them but whom say ye that i am peter answering said the christ of god and he straitly charged them and commanded them to tell no man that thing saying the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be slain and be raised the third day and he said to them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it for what is a man advantaged if he gain the whole world and lose himself or be cast away for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words of him shall the son of man be ashamed when he shall come in his own glory and in his fathers and of the holy angels but i tell you of a truth there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of god and it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings he took peter and john and james and went up into a mountain to pray and as he prayed the fashion of his countenance was altered and his raiment was white and glistering and behold there talked with him two men which were moses and elias who appeared in glory and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at jerusalem but peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep and when they were awake they saw his glory and the two men that stood with him and it came to pass as they departed from him peter said unto jesus master it is good for us to be here and let us make three tabernacles one for thee and one for moses and one for elias not knowing what he said while he thus spake there came a cloud and overshadowed them and they feared as they entered into the cloud and there came a voice out of the
