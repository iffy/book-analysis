cloud saying this is my beloved son hear him and when the voice was past jesus was found alone and they kept it close and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen and it came to pass that on the next day when they were come down from the hill much people met him and behold a man of the company cried out saying master i beseech thee look upon my son for he is mine only child and lo a spirit taketh him and he suddenly crieth out and it teareth him that he foameth again and bruising him hardly departeth from him and i besought thy disciples to cast him out and they could not and jesus answering said o faithless and perverse generation how long shall i be with you and suffer you bring thy son hither and as he was yet a coming the devil threw him down and tare him and jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the child and delivered him again to his father and they were all amazed at the mighty power of god but while they wondered every one at all things which jesus did he said unto his disciples let these sayings sink down into your ears for the son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men but they understood not this saying and it was hid from them that they perceived it not and they feared to ask him of that saying then there arose a reasoning among them which of them should be greatest and jesus perceiving the thought of their heart took a child and set him by him and said unto them whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me for he that is least among you all the same shall be great and john answered and said master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and we forbad him because he followeth not with us and jesus said unto him forbid him not for he that is not against us is for us and it came to pass when the time was come that he should be received up he stedfastly set his face to go to jerusalem and sent messengers before his face and they went and entered into a village of the samaritans to make ready for him and they did not receive him because his face was as though he would go to jerusalem and when his disciples james and john saw this they said lord wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them even as elias did but he turned and rebuked them and said ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of for the son of man is not come to destroy mens lives but to save them and they went to another village and it came to pass that as they went in the way a certain man said unto him lord i will follow thee whithersoever thou goest and jesus said unto him foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the son of man hath not where to lay his head and he said unto another follow me but he said lord suffer me first to go and bury my father jesus said unto him let the dead bury their dead but go thou and preach the kingdom of god and another also said lord i will follow thee but let me first go bid them farewell which are at home at my house and jesus said unto him no man having put his hand to the plough and looking back is fit for the kingdom of god after these things the lord appointed other seventy also and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place whither he himself would come therefore said he unto them the harvest truly is great but the labourers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he would send forth labourers into his harvest go your ways behold i send you forth as lambs among wolves carry neither purse nor scrip nor shoes and salute no man by the way and into whatsoever house ye enter first say peace be to this house and if the son of peace be there your peace shall rest upon it if not it shall turn to you again and in the same house remain eating and drinking such things as they give for the labourer is worthy of his hire go not from house to house and into whatsoever city ye enter and they receive you eat such things as are set before you and heal the sick that are therein and say unto them the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you but into whatsoever city ye enter and they receive you not go your ways out into the streets of the same and say even the very dust of your city which cleaveth on us we do wipe off against you notwithstanding be ye sure of this that the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you but i say unto you that it shall be more tolerable in that day for sodom than for that city woe unto thee chorazin woe unto thee bethsaida for if the mighty works had been done in tyre and sidon which have been done in you they had a great while ago repented sitting in sackcloth and ashes but it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sidon at the judgment than for you and thou capernaum which art exalted to heaven shalt be thrust down to hell he that heareth you heareth me and he that despiseth you despiseth me and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me and the seventy returned again with joy saying lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name and he said unto them i beheld satan as lightning fall from heaven behold i give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you notwithstanding in this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather rejoice because your
