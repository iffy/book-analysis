i have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram and the lord put a word in balaams mouth and said return unto balak and thus thou shalt speak and he returned unto him and lo he stood by his burnt sacrifice he and all the princes of moab and he took up his parable and said balak the king of moab hath brought me from aram out of the mountains of the east saying come curse me jacob and come defy israel how shall i curse whom god hath not cursed or how shall i defy whom the lord hath not defied for from the top of the rocks i see him and from the hills i behold him lo the people shall dwell alone and shall not be reckoned among the nations who can count the dust of jacob and the number of the fourth part of israel let me die the death of the righteous and let my last end be like his and balak said unto balaam what hast thou done unto me i took thee to curse mine enemies and behold thou hast blessed them altogether and he answered and said must i not take heed to speak that which the lord hath put in my mouth and balak said unto him come i pray thee with me unto another place from whence thou mayest see them thou shalt see but the utmost part of them and shalt not see them all and curse me them from thence and he brought him into the field of zophim to the top of pisgah and built seven altars and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar and he said unto balak stand here by thy burnt offering while i meet the lord yonder and the lord met balaam and put a word in his mouth and said go again unto balak and say thus and when he came to him behold he stood by his burnt offering and the princes of moab with him and balak said unto him what hath the lord spoken and he took up his parable and said rise up balak and hear hearken unto me thou son of zippor god is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent hath he said and shall he not do it or hath he spoken and shall he not make it good behold i have received commandment to bless and he hath blessed and i cannot reverse it he hath not beheld iniquity in jacob neither hath he seen perverseness in israel the lord his god is with him and the shout of a king is among them god brought them out of egypt he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn surely there is no enchantment against jacob neither is there any divination against israel according to this time it shall be said of jacob and of israel what hath god wrought behold the people shall rise up as a great lion and lift up himself as a young lion he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey and drink the blood of the slain and balak said unto balaam neither curse them at all nor bless them at all but balaam answered and said unto balak told not i thee saying all that the lord speaketh that i must do and balak said unto balaam come i pray thee i will bring thee unto another place peradventure it will please god that thou mayest curse me them from thence and balak brought balaam unto the top of peor that looketh toward jeshimon and balaam said unto balak build me here seven altars and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams and balak did as balaam had said and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar and when balaam saw that it pleased the lord to bless israel he went not as at other times to seek for enchantments but he set his face toward the wilderness and balaam lifted up his eyes and he saw israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes and the spirit of god came upon him and he took up his parable and said balaam the son of beor hath said and the man whose eyes are open hath said he hath said which heard the words of god which saw the vision of the almighty falling into a trance but having his eyes open how goodly are thy tents o jacob and thy tabernacles o israel as the valleys are they spread forth as gardens by the rivers side as the trees of lign aloes which the lord hath planted and as cedar trees beside the waters he shall pour the water out of his buckets and his seed shall be in many waters and his king shall be higher than agag and his kingdom shall be exalted god brought him forth out of egypt he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn he shall eat up the nations his enemies and shall break their bones and pierce them through with his arrows he couched he lay down as a lion and as a great lion who shall stir him up blessed is he that blesseth thee and cursed is he that curseth thee and balaks anger was kindled against balaam and he smote his hands together and balak said unto balaam i called thee to curse mine enemies and behold thou hast altogether blessed them these three times therefore now flee thou to thy place i thought to promote thee unto great honour but lo the lord hath kept thee back from honour and balaam said unto balak spake i not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me saying if balak would give me his house full of silver and gold i cannot go beyond the commandment of the lord to do either good or bad of mine own mind but what the lord saith that will i speak and now behold i go unto my people come therefore and i will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days and he took up his parable and said balaam the son of beor hath said and the man whose eyes are open hath said
