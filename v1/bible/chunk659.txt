into another place now as soon as it was day there was no small stir among the soldiers what was become of peter and when herod had sought for him and found him not he examined the keepers and commanded that they should be put to death and he went down from judaea to caesarea and there abode and herod was highly displeased with them of tyre and sidon but they came with one accord to him and having made blastus the kings chamberlain their friend desired peace because their country was nourished by the kings country and upon a set day herod arrayed in royal apparel sat upon his throne and made an oration unto them and the people gave a shout saying it is the voice of a god and not of a man and immediately the angel of the lord smote him because he gave not god the glory and he was eaten of worms and gave up the ghost but the word of god grew and multiplied and barnabas and saul returned from jerusalem when they had fulfilled their ministry and took with them john whose surname was mark now there were in the church that was at antioch certain prophets and teachers as barnabas and simeon that was called niger and lucius of cyrene and manaen which had been brought up with herod the tetrarch and saul as they ministered to the lord and fasted the holy ghost said separate me barnabas and saul for the work whereunto i have called them and when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them they sent them away so they being sent forth by the holy ghost departed unto seleucia and from thence they sailed to cyprus and when they were at salamis they preached the word of god in the synagogues of the jews and they had also john to their minister and when they had gone through the isle unto paphos they found a certain sorcerer a false prophet a jew whose name was barjesus which was with the deputy of the country sergius paulus a prudent man who called for barnabas and saul and desired to hear the word of god but elymas the sorcerer for so is his name by interpretation withstood them seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith then saul who also is called paul filled with the holy ghost set his eyes on him and said o full of all subtilty and all mischief thou child of the devil thou enemy of all righteousness wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the lord and now behold the hand of the lord is upon thee and thou shalt be blind not seeing the sun for a season and immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand then the deputy when he saw what was done believed being astonished at the doctrine of the lord now when paul and his company loosed from paphos they came to perga in pamphylia and john departing from them returned to jerusalem but when they departed from perga they came to antioch in pisidia and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and sat down and after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them saying ye men and brethren if ye have any word of exhortation for the people say on then paul stood up and beckoning with his hand said men of israel and ye that fear god give audience the god of this people of israel chose our fathers and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of egypt and with an high arm brought he them out of it and about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness and when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of chanaan he divided their land to them by lot and after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years until samuel the prophet and afterward they desired a king and god gave unto them saul the son of cis a man of the tribe of benjamin by the space of forty years and when he had removed him he raised up unto them david to be their king to whom also he gave their testimony and said i have found david the son of jesse a man after mine own heart which shall fulfil all my will of this mans seed hath god according to his promise raised unto israel a saviour jesus when john had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of israel and as john fulfilled his course he said whom think ye that i am i am not he but behold there cometh one after me whose shoes of his feet i am not worthy to loose men and brethren children of the stock of abraham and whosoever among you feareth god to you is the word of this salvation sent for they that dwell at jerusalem and their rulers because they knew him not nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day they have fulfilled them in condemning him and though they found no cause of death in him yet desired they pilate that he should be slain and when they had fulfilled all that was written of him they took him down from the tree and laid him in a sepulchre but god raised him from the dead and he was seen many days of them which came up with him from galilee to jerusalem who are his witnesses unto the people and we declare unto you glad tidings how that the promise which was made unto the fathers god hath fulfilled the same unto us their children in that he hath raised up jesus again as it is also written in the second psalm thou art my son this day have i begotten thee and as concerning that he raised him up from the dead now no more to return to corruption he said on this wise i will give you the sure mercies of david wherefore he saith also in another psalm thou shalt not
