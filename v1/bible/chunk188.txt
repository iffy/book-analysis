of dagon nor any that come into dagons house tread on the threshold of dagon in ashdod unto this day but the hand of the lord was heavy upon them of ashdod and he destroyed them and smote them with emerods even ashdod and the coasts thereof and when the men of ashdod saw that it was so they said the ark of the god of israel shall not abide with us for his hand is sore upon us and upon dagon our god they sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the philistines unto them and said what shall we do with the ark of the god of israel and they answered let the ark of the god of israel be carried about unto gath and they carried the ark of the god of israel about thither and it was so that after they had carried it about the hand of the lord was against the city with a very great destruction and he smote the men of the city both small and great and they had emerods in their secret parts therefore they sent the ark of god to ekron and it came to pass as the ark of god came to ekron that the ekronites cried out saying they have brought about the ark of the god of israel to us to slay us and our people so they sent and gathered together all the lords of the philistines and said send away the ark of the god of israel and let it go again to his own place that it slay us not and our people for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city the hand of god was very heavy there and the men that died not were smitten with the emerods and the cry of the city went up to heaven and the ark of the lord was in the country of the philistines seven months and the philistines called for the priests and the diviners saying what shall we do to the ark of the lord tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place and they said if ye send away the ark of the god of israel send it not empty but in any wise return him a trespass offering then ye shall be healed and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you then said they what shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him they answered five golden emerods and five golden mice according to the number of the lords of the philistines for one plague was on you all and on your lords wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods and images of your mice that mar the land and ye shall give glory unto the god of israel peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you and from off your gods and from off your land wherefore then do ye harden your hearts as the egyptians and pharaoh hardened their hearts when he had wrought wonderfully among them did they not let the people go and they departed now therefore make a new cart and take two milch kine on which there hath come no yoke and tie the kine to the cart and bring their calves home from them and take the ark of the lord and lay it upon the cart and put the jewels of gold which ye return him for a trespass offering in a coffer by the side thereof and send it away that it may go and see if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to bethshemesh then he hath done us this great evil but if not then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us it was a chance that happened to us and the men did so and took two milch kine and tied them to the cart and shut up their calves at home and they laid the ark of the lord upon the cart and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods and the kine took the straight way to the way of bethshemesh and went along the highway lowing as they went and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left and the lords of the philistines went after them unto the border of bethshemesh and they of bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley and they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark and rejoiced to see it and the cart came into the field of joshua a bethshemite and stood there where there was a great stone and they clave the wood of the cart and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the lord and the levites took down the ark of the lord and the coffer that was with it wherein the jewels of gold were and put them on the great stone and the men of bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the lord and when the five lords of the philistines had seen it they returned to ekron the same day and these are the golden emerods which the philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the lord for ashdod one for gaza one for askelon one for gath one for ekron one and the golden mice according to the number of all the cities of the philistines belonging to the five lords both of fenced cities and of country villages even unto the great stone of abel whereon they set down the ark of the lord which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of joshua the bethshemite and he smote the men of bethshemesh because they had looked into the ark of the lord even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men and the people lamented because the lord had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter and the men of bethshemesh said who is able to stand before this holy lord god and to whom shall he go up from us and they sent messengers to the inhabitants of kirjathjearim saying the philistines have brought again the ark of the lord come ye down and fetch it up to you and the men of kirjathjearim came
