king delight to do honour more than to myself and haman answered the king for the man whom the king delighteth to honour let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear and the horse that the king rideth upon and the crown royal which is set upon his head and let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the kings most noble princes that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth to honour and bring him on horseback through the street of the city and proclaim before him thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour then the king said to haman make haste and take the apparel and the horse as thou hast said and do even so to mordecai the jew that sitteth at the kings gate let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken then took haman the apparel and the horse and arrayed mordecai and brought him on horseback through the street of the city and proclaimed before him thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour and mordecai came again to the kings gate but haman hasted to his house mourning and having his head covered and haman told zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him then said his wise men and zeresh his wife unto him if mordecai be of the seed of the jews before whom thou hast begun to fall thou shalt not prevail against him but shalt surely fall before him and while they were yet talking with him came the kings chamberlains and hasted to bring haman unto the banquet that esther had prepared so the king and haman came to banquet with esther the queen and the king said again unto esther on the second day at the banquet of wine what is thy petition queen esther and it shall be granted thee and what is thy request and it shall be performed even to the half of the kingdom then esther the queen answered and said if i have found favour in thy sight o king and if it please the king let my life be given me at my petition and my people at my request for we are sold i and my people to be destroyed to be slain and to perish but if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen i had held my tongue although the enemy could not countervail the kings damage then the king ahasuerus answered and said unto esther the queen who is he and where is he that durst presume in his heart to do so and esther said the adversary and enemy is this wicked haman then haman was afraid before the king and the queen and the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden and haman stood up to make request for his life to esther the queen for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine and haman was fallen upon the bed whereon esther was then said the king will he force the queen also before me in the house as the word went out of kings mouth they covered hamans face and harbonah one of the chamberlains said before the king behold also the gallows fifty cubits high which haman had made for mordecai who spoken good for the king standeth in the house of haman then the king said hang him thereon so they hanged haman on the gallows that he had prepared for mordecai then was the kings wrath pacified on that day did the king ahasuerus give the house of haman the jews enemy unto esther the queen and mordecai came before the king for esther had told what he was unto her and the king took off his ring which he had taken from haman and gave it unto mordecai and esther set mordecai over the house of haman and esther spake yet again before the king and fell down at his feet and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of haman the agagite and his device that he had devised against the jews then the king held out the golden sceptre toward esther so esther arose and stood before the king and said if it please the king and if i have favour in his sight and the thing seem right before the king and i be pleasing in his eyes let it be written to reverse the letters devised by haman the son of hammedatha the agagite which he wrote to destroy the jews which are in all the kings provinces for how can i endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people or how can i endure to see the destruction of my kindred then the king ahasuerus said unto esther the queen and to mordecai the jew behold i have given esther the house of haman and him they have hanged upon the gallows because he laid his hand upon the jews write ye also for the jews as it liketh you in the kings name and seal it with the kings ring for the writing which is written in the kings name and sealed with the kings ring may no man reverse then were the kings scribes called at that time in the third month that is the month sivan on the three and twentieth day thereof and it was written according to all that mordecai commanded unto the jews and to the lieutenants and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from india unto ethiopia an hundred twenty and seven provinces unto every province according to the writing thereof and unto every people after their language and to the jews according to their writing and according to their language and he wrote in the king ahasuerus name and sealed it with the kings ring and sent letters by posts on horseback and riders on mules camels and young dromedaries wherein the king granted the jews which were in every city to gather themselves together and to stand for their life to destroy to slay
