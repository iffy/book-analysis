which did eat with him by themselves because the egyptians might not eat bread with the hebrews for that is an abomination unto the egyptians and they sat before him the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth and the men marvelled one at another and he took and sent messes unto them from before him but benjamins mess was five times so much as any of theirs and they drank and were merry with him and he commanded the steward of his house saying fill the mens sacks with food as much as they can carry and put every mans money in his sacks mouth and put my cup the silver cup in the sacks mouth of the youngest and his corn money and he did according to the word that joseph had spoken as soon as the morning was light the men were sent away they and their asses and when they were gone out of the city and not yet far off joseph said unto his steward up follow after the men and when thou dost overtake them say unto them wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good is not this it in which my lord drinketh and whereby indeed he divineth ye have done evil in so doing and he overtook them and he spake unto them these same words and they said unto him wherefore saith my lord these words god forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing behold the money which we found in our sacks mouths we brought again unto thee out of the land of canaan how then should we steal out of thy lords house silver or gold with whomsoever of thy servants it be found both let him die and we also will be my lords bondmen and he said now also let it be according unto your words he with whom it is found shall be my servant and ye shall be blameless then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground and opened every man his sack and he searched and began at the eldest and left at the youngest and the cup was found in benjamins sack then they rent their clothes and laded every man his ass and returned to the city and judah and his brethren came to josephs house for he was yet there and they fell before him on the ground and joseph said unto them what deed is this that ye have done wot ye not that such a man as i can certainly divine and judah said what shall we say unto my lord what shall we speak or how shall we clear ourselves god hath found out the iniquity of thy servants behold we are my lords servants both we and he also with whom the cup is found and he said god forbid that i should do so but the man in whose hand the cup is found he shall be my servant and as for you get you up in peace unto your father then judah came near unto him and said oh my lord let thy servant i pray thee speak a word in my lords ears and let not thine anger burn against thy servant for thou art even as pharaoh my lord asked his servants saying have ye a father or a brother and we said unto my lord we have a father an old man and a child of his old age a little one and his brother is dead and he alone is left of his mother and his father loveth him and thou saidst unto thy servants bring him down unto me that i may set mine eyes upon him and we said unto my lord the lad cannot leave his father for if he should leave his father his father would die and thou saidst unto thy servants except your youngest brother come down with you ye shall see my face no more and it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father we told him the words of my lord and our father said go again and buy us a little food and we said we cannot go down if our youngest brother be with us then will we go down for we may not see the mans face except our youngest brother be with us and thy servant my father said unto us ye know that my wife bare me two sons and the one went out from me and i said surely he is torn in pieces and i saw him not since and if ye take this also from me and mischief befall him ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave now therefore when i come to thy servant my father and the lad be not with us seeing that his life is bound up in the lads life it shall come to pass when he seeth that the lad is not with us that he will die and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave for thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father saying if i bring him not unto thee then i shall bear the blame to my father for ever now therefore i pray thee let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord and let the lad go up with his brethren for how shall i go up to my father and the lad be not with me lest peradventure i see the evil that shall come on my father then joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him and he cried cause every man to go out from me and there stood no man with him while joseph made himself known unto his brethren and he wept aloud and the egyptians and the house of pharaoh heard and joseph said unto his brethren i am joseph doth my father yet live and his brethren could not answer him for they were troubled at his presence and joseph said unto his brethren come near to me i pray you and they came near and he said i am joseph your brother whom ye sold into egypt now therefore be not
