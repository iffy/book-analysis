the eyes and cause sorrow of heart and ye shall sow your seed in vain for your enemies shall eat it and i will set my face against you and ye shall be slain before your enemies they that hate you shall reign over you and ye shall flee when none pursueth you and if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me then i will punish you seven times more for your sins and i will break the pride of your power and i will make your heaven as iron and your earth as brass and your strength shall be spent in vain for your land shall not yield her increase neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits and if ye walk contrary unto me and will not hearken unto me i will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins i will also send wild beasts among you which shall rob you of your children and destroy your cattle and make you few in number and your high ways shall be desolate and if ye will not be reformed by me by these things but will walk contrary unto me then will i also walk contrary unto you and will punish you yet seven times for your sins and i will bring a sword upon you that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant and when ye are gathered together within your cities i will send the pestilence among you and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy and when i have broken the staff of your bread ten women shall bake your bread in one oven and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight and ye shall eat and not be satisfied and if ye will not for all this hearken unto me but walk contrary unto me then i will walk contrary unto you also in fury and i even i will chastise you seven times for your sins and ye shall eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat and i will destroy your high places and cut down your images and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols and my soul shall abhor you and i will make your cities waste and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation and i will not smell the savour of your sweet odours and i will bring the land into desolation and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it and i will scatter you among the heathen and will draw out a sword after you and your land shall be desolate and your cities waste then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths as long as it lieth desolate and ye be in your enemies land even then shall the land rest and enjoy her sabbaths as long as it lieth desolate it shall rest because it did not rest in your sabbaths when ye dwelt upon it and upon them that are left alive of you i will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them and they shall flee as fleeing from a sword and they shall fall when none pursueth and they shall fall one upon another as it were before a sword when none pursueth and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies and ye shall perish among the heathen and the land of your enemies shall eat you up and they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies lands and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them if they shall confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers with their trespass which they trespassed against me and that also they have walked contrary unto me and that i also have walked contrary unto them and have brought them into the land of their enemies if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity then will i remember my covenant with jacob and also my covenant with isaac and also my covenant with abraham will i remember and i will remember the land the land also shall be left of them and shall enjoy her sabbaths while she lieth desolate without them and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity because even because they despised my judgments and because their soul abhorred my statutes and yet for all that when they be in the land of their enemies i will not cast them away neither will i abhor them to destroy them utterly and to break my covenant with them for i am the lord their god but i will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors whom i brought forth out of the land of egypt in the sight of the heathen that i might be their god i am the lord these are the statutes and judgments and laws which the lord made between him and the children of israel in mount sinai by the hand of moses and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when a man shall make a singular vow the persons shall be for the lord by thy estimation and thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver after the shekel of the sanctuary and if it be a female then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels and if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels and for the female ten shekels and if it be from a month old even unto five years old then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver and if it be from sixty years old and above if it be a male then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels and for the female ten shekels but if he be poorer than thy estimation then he shall present himself before the priest and the priest shall value him
