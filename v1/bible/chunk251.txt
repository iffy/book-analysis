the king said come down quickly and elijah answered and said unto them if i be a man of god let fire come down from heaven and consume thee and thy fifty and the fire of god came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty and he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty and the third captain of fifty went up and came and fell on his knees before elijah and besought him and said unto him o man of god i pray thee let my life and the life of these fifty thy servants be precious in thy sight behold there came fire down from heaven and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight and the angel of the lord said unto elijah go down with him be not afraid of him and he arose and went down with him unto the king and he said unto him thus saith the lord forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of baalzebub the god of ekron is it not because there is no god in israel to enquire of his word therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up but shalt surely die so he died according to the word of the lord which elijah had spoken and jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of jehoram the son of jehoshaphat king of judah because he had no son now the rest of the acts of ahaziah which he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel and it came to pass when the lord would take up elijah into heaven by a whirlwind that elijah went with elisha from gilgal and elijah said unto elisha tarry here i pray thee for the lord hath sent me to bethel and elisha said unto him as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee so they went down to bethel and the sons of the prophets that were at bethel came forth to elisha and said unto him knowest thou that the lord will take away thy master from thy head to day and he said yea i know it hold ye your peace and elijah said unto him elisha tarry here i pray thee for the lord hath sent me to jericho and he said as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee so they came to jericho and the sons of the prophets that were at jericho came to elisha and said unto him knowest thou that the lord will take away thy master from thy head to day and he answered yea i know it hold ye your peace and elijah said unto him tarry i pray thee here for the lord hath sent me to jordan and he said as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee and they two went on and fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood to view afar off and they two stood by jordan and elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote the waters and they were divided hither and thither so that they two went over on dry ground and it came to pass when they were gone over that elijah said unto elisha ask what i shall do for thee before i be taken away from thee and elisha said i pray thee let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me and he said thou hast asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when i am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire and parted them both asunder and elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven and elisha saw it and he cried my father my father the chariot of israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces he took up also the mantle of elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of jordan and he took the mantle of elijah that fell from him and smote the waters and said where is the lord god of elijah and when he also had smitten the waters they parted hither and thither and elisha went over and when the sons of the prophets which were to view at jericho saw him they said the spirit of elijah doth rest on elisha and they came to meet him and bowed themselves to the ground before him and they said unto him behold now there be with thy servants fifty strong men let them go we pray thee and seek thy master lest peradventure the spirit of the lord hath taken him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley and he said ye shall not send and when they urged him till he was ashamed he said send they sent therefore fifty men and they sought three days but found him not and when they came again to him for he tarried at jericho he said unto them did i not say unto you go not and the men of the city said unto elisha behold i pray thee the situation of this city is pleasant as my lord seeth but the water is naught and the ground barren and he said bring me a new cruse and put salt therein and they brought it to him and he went forth unto the spring of the waters and cast the salt in there and said thus saith the lord i have healed these waters there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land so the waters were healed unto this day according to the saying of elisha which he spake and he went up from thence unto bethel and as he was going up by the way there came forth little children out of the city and
