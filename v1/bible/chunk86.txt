and let all the congregation stone him and thou shalt speak unto the children of israel saying whosoever curseth his god shall bear his sin and he that blasphemeth the name of the lord he shall surely be put to death and all the congregation shall certainly stone him as well the stranger as he that is born in the land when he blasphemeth the name of the lord shall be put to death and he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death and he that killeth a beast shall make it good beast for beast and if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour as he hath done so shall it be done to him breach for breach eye for eye tooth for tooth as he hath caused a blemish in a man so shall it be done to him again and he that killeth a beast he shall restore it and he that killeth a man he shall be put to death ye shall have one manner of law as well for the stranger as for one of your own country for i am the lord your god and moses spake to the children of israel that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp and stone him with stones and the children of israel did as the lord commanded moses and the lord spake unto moses in mount sinai saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when ye come into the land which i give you then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the lord six years thou shalt sow thy field and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard and gather in the fruit thereof but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land a sabbath for the lord thou shalt neither sow thy field nor prune thy vineyard that which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed for it is a year of rest unto the land and the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you for thee and for thy servant and for thy maid and for thy hired servant and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee and for thy cattle and for the beast that are in thy land shall all the increase thereof be meat and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and ye shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubile unto you and ye shall return every man unto his possession and ye shall return every man unto his family a jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you ye shall not sow neither reap that which groweth of itself in it nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed for it is the jubile it shall be holy unto you ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field in the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession and if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour or buyest ought of thy neighbours hand ye shall not oppress one another according to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee according to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee ye shall not therefore oppress one another but thou shalt fear thy godfor i am the lord your god wherefore ye shall do my statutes and keep my judgments and do them and ye shall dwell in the land in safety and the land shall yield her fruit and ye shall eat your fill and dwell therein in safety and if ye shall say what shall we eat the seventh year behold we shall not sow nor gather in our increase then i will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year and it shall bring forth fruit for three years and ye shall sow the eighth year and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store the land shall not be sold for ever for the land is mine for ye are strangers and sojourners with me and in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land if thy brother be waxen poor and hath sold away some of his possession and if any of his kin come to redeem it then shall he redeem that which his brother sold and if the man have none to redeem it and himself be able to redeem it then let him count the years of the sale thereof and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it that he may return unto his possession but if he be not able to restore it to him then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile and in the jubile it shall go out and he shall return unto his possession and if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold within a full year may he redeem it and if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations it shall not go out in the jubile but the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country they
