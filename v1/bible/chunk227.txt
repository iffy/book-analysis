of israel and they passed over jordan and pitched in aroer on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of gad and toward jazer then they came to gilead and to the land of tahtimhodshi and they came to danjaan and about to zidon and came to the strong hold of tyre and to all the cities of the hivites and of the canaanites and they went out to the south of judah even to beersheba so when they had gone through all the land they came to jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days and joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king and there were in israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword and the men of judah were five hundred thousand men and davids heart smote him after that he had numbered the people and david said unto the lord i have sinned greatly in that i have done and now i beseech thee o lord take away the iniquity of thy servant for i have done very foolishly for when david was up in the morning the word of the lord came unto the prophet gad davids seer saying go and say unto david thus saith the lord i offer thee three things choose thee one of them that i may do it unto thee so gad came to david and told him and said unto him shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies while they pursue thee or that there be three days pestilence in thy land now advise and see what answer i shall return to him that sent me and david said unto gad i am in a great strait let us fall now into the hand of the lord for his mercies are great and let me not fall into the hand of man so the lord sent a pestilence upon israel from the morning even to the time appointed and there died of the people from dan even to beersheba seventy thousand men and when the angel stretched out his hand upon jerusalem to destroy it the lord repented him of the evil and said to the angel that destroyed the people it is enough stay now thine hand and the angel of the lord was by the threshingplace of araunah the jebusite and david spake unto the lord when he saw the angel that smote the people and said lo i have sinned and i have done wickedly but these sheep what have they done let thine hand i pray thee be against me and against my fathers house and gad came that day to david and said unto him go up rear an altar unto the lord in the threshingfloor of araunah the jebusite and david according to the saying of gad went up as the lord commanded and araunah looked and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him and araunah went out and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground and araunah said wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant and david said to buy the threshingfloor of thee to build an altar unto the lord that the plague may be stayed from the people and araunah said unto david let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him behold here be oxen for burnt sacrifice and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood all these things did araunah as a king give unto the king and araunah said unto the king the lord thy god accept thee and the king said unto araunah nay but i will surely buy it of thee at a price neither will i offer burnt offerings unto the lord my god of that which doth cost me nothing so david bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver and david built there an altar unto the lord and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings so the lord was intreated for the land and the plague was stayed from israel the first book of the kings commonly called the third book of the kings now king david was old and stricken in years and they covered him with clothes but he gat no heat wherefore his servants said unto him let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin and let her stand before the king and let her cherish him and let her lie in thy bosom that my lord the king may get heat so they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of israel and found abishag a shunammite and brought her to the king and the damsel was very fair and cherished the king and ministered to him but the king knew her not then adonijah the son of haggith exalted himself saying i will be king and he prepared him chariots and horsemen and fifty men to run before him and his father had not displeased him at any time in saying why hast thou done so and he also was a very goodly man and his mother bare him after absalom and he conferred with joab the son of zeruiah and with abiathar the priest and they following adonijah helped him but zadok the priest and benaiah the son of jehoiada and nathan the prophet and shimei and rei and the mighty men which belonged to david were not with adonijah and adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of zoheleth which is by enrogel and called all his brethren the kings sons and all the men of judah the kings servants but nathan the prophet and benaiah and the mighty men and solomon his brother he called not wherefore nathan spake unto bathsheba the mother of solomon saying hast thou not heard that adonijah the son of haggith doth reign and david our lord knoweth it not now therefore come let me i pray thee give thee counsel that thou mayest save thine own life and the life of thy son solomon go and get thee in unto king david and say unto him didst not thou my lord o king swear
