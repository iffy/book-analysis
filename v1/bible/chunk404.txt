only to plenteousness but of every one that is hasty only to want the getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death the robbery of the wicked shall destroy them because they refuse to do judgment the way of man is froward and strange but as for the pure his work is right it is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop than with a brawling woman in a wide house the soul of the wicked desireth evil his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes when the scorner is punished the simple is made wise and when the wise is instructed he receiveth knowledge the righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked but god overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor he also shall cry himself but shall not be heard a gift in secret pacifieth anger and a reward in the bosom strong wrath it is joy to the just to do judgment but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity the man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead he that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich the wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous and the transgressor for the upright it is better to dwell in the wilderness than with a contentious and an angry woman there is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise but a foolish man spendeth it up he that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life righteousness and honour a wise man scaleth the city of the mighty and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles proud and haughty scorner is his name who dealeth in proud wrath the desire of the slothful killeth him for his hands refuse to labour he coveteth greedily all the day long but the righteous giveth and spareth not the sacrifice of the wicked is abomination how much more when he bringeth it with a wicked mind a false witness shall perish but the man that heareth speaketh constantly a wicked man hardeneth his face but as for the upright he directeth his way there is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the lord the horse is prepared against the day of battle but safety is of the lord a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches and loving favour rather than silver and gold the rich and poor meet together the lord is the maker of them all a prudent man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself but the simple pass on and are punished by humility and the fear of the lord are riches and honour and life thorns and snares are in the way of the froward he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it the rich ruleth over the poor and the borrower is servant to the lender he that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity and the rod of his anger shall fail he that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed for he giveth of his bread to the poor cast out the scorner and contention shall go out yea strife and reproach shall cease he that loveth pureness of heart for the grace of his lips the king shall be his friend the eyes of the lord preserve knowledge and he overthroweth the words of the transgressor the slothful man saith there is a lion without i shall be slain in the streets the mouth of strange women is a deep pit he that is abhorred of the lord shall fall therein foolishness is bound in the heart of a child but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him he that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches and he that giveth to the rich shall surely come to want bow down thine ear and hear the words of the wise and apply thine heart unto my knowledge for it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee they shall withal be fitted in thy lips that thy trust may be in the lord i have made known to thee this day even to thee have not i written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge that i might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee rob not the poor because he is poor neither oppress the afflicted in the gate for the lord will plead their cause and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them make no friendship with an angry man and with a furious man thou shalt not go lest thou learn his ways and get a snare to thy soul be not thou one of them that strike hands or of them that are sureties for debts if thou hast nothing to pay why should he take away thy bed from under thee remove not the ancient landmark which thy fathers have set seest thou a man diligent in his business he shall stand before kings he shall not stand before mean men when thou sittest to eat with a ruler consider diligently what is before thee and put a knife to thy throat if thou be a man given to appetite be not desirous of his dainties for they are deceitful meat labour not to be rich cease from thine own wisdom wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not for riches certainly make themselves wings they fly away as an eagle toward heaven eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye neither desire thou his dainty meats for as he thinketh in his heart so is he eat and drink saith he to thee but his heart is not with thee the morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up and lose thy sweet words speak not in the ears of a fool for he will despise the
