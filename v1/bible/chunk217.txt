for with such robes were the kings daughters that were virgins apparelled then his servant brought her out and bolted the door after her and tamar put ashes on her head and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her and laid her hand on her head and went on crying and absalom her brother said unto her hath amnon thy brother been with thee but hold now thy peace my sister he is thy brother regard not this thing so tamar remained desolate in her brother absaloms house but when king david heard of all these things he was very wroth and absalom spake unto his brother amnon neither good nor bad for absalom hated amnon because he had forced his sister tamar and it came to pass after two full years that absalom had sheepshearers in baalhazor which is beside ephraim and absalom invited all the kings sons and absalom came to the king and said behold now thy servant hath sheepshearers let the king i beseech thee and his servants go with thy servant and the king said to absalom nay my son let us not all now go lest we be chargeable unto thee and he pressed him howbeit he would not go but blessed him then said absalom if not i pray thee let my brother amnon go with us and the king said unto him why should he go with thee but absalom pressed him that he let amnon and all the kings sons go with him now absalom had commanded his servants saying mark ye now when amnons heart is merry with wine and when i say unto you smite amnon then kill him fear not have not i commanded you be courageous and be valiant and the servants of absalom did unto amnon as absalom had commanded then all the kings sons arose and every man gat him up upon his mule and fled and it came to pass while they were in the way that tidings came to david saying absalom hath slain all the kings sons and there is not one of them left then the king arose and tare his garments and lay on the earth and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent and jonadab the son of shimeah davids brother answered and said let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the kings sons for amnon only is dead for by the appointment of absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister tamar now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart to think that all the kings sons are dead for amnon only is dead but absalom fled and the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him and jonadab said unto the king behold the kings sons come as thy servant said so it is and it came to pass as soon as he had made an end of speaking that behold the kings sons came and lifted up their voice and wept and the king also and all his servants wept very sore but absalom fled and went to talmai the son of ammihud king of geshur and david mourned for his son every day so absalom fled and went to geshur and was there three years and the soul of king david longed to go forth unto absalom for he was comforted concerning amnon seeing he was dead now joab the son of zeruiah perceived that the kings heart was toward absalom and joab sent to tekoah and fetched thence a wise woman and said unto her i pray thee feign thyself to be a mourner and put on now mourning apparel and anoint not thyself with oil but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead and come to the king and speak on this manner unto him so joab put the words in her mouth and when the woman of tekoah spake to the king she fell on her face to the ground and did obeisance and said help o king and the king said unto her what aileth thee and she answered i am indeed a widow woman and mine husband is dead and thy handmaid had two sons and they two strove together in the field and there was none to part them but the one smote the other and slew him and behold the whole family is risen against thine handmaid and they said deliver him that smote his brother that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew and we will destroy the heir also and so they shall quench my coal which is left and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth and the king said unto the woman go to thine house and i will give charge concerning thee and the woman of tekoah said unto the king my lord o king the iniquity be on me and on my fathers house and the king and his throne be guiltless and the king said whoever saith ought unto thee bring him to me and he shall not touch thee any more then said she i pray thee let the king remember the lord thy god that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more lest they destroy my son and he said as the lord liveth there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth then the woman said let thine handmaid i pray thee speak one word unto my lord the king and he said say on and the woman said wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of god for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished for we must needs die and are as water spilt on the ground which cannot be gathered up again neither doth god respect any person yet doth he devise means that his banished be not expelled from him now therefore that i am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king
