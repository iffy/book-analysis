will lay stumblingblocks before this people and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them the neighbour and his friend shall perish thus saith the lord behold a people cometh from the north country and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth they shall lay hold on bow and spear they are cruel and have no mercy their voice roareth like the sea and they ride upon horses set in array as men for war against thee o daughter of zion we have heard the fame thereof our hands wax feeble anguish hath taken hold of us and pain as of a woman in travail go not forth into the field nor walk by the way for the sword of the enemy and fear is on every side o daughter of my people gird thee with sackcloth and wallow thyself in ashes make thee mourning as for an only son most bitter lamentation for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us i have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my people that thou mayest know and try their way they are all grievous revolters walking with slanders they are brass and iron they are all corrupters the bellows are burned the lead is consumed of the fire the founder melteth in vain for the wicked are not plucked away reprobate silver shall men call them because the lord hath rejected them the word that came to jeremiah from the lord saying stand in the gate of the lords house and proclaim there this word and say hear the word of the lord all ye of judah that enter in at these gates to worship the lord thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel amend your ways and your doings and i will cause you to dwell in this place trust ye not in lying words saying the temple of the lord the temple of the lord the temple of the lord are these for if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings if ye throughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour if ye oppress not the stranger the fatherless and the widow and shed not innocent blood in this place neither walk after other gods to your hurt then will i cause you to dwell in this place in the land that i gave to your fathers for ever and ever behold ye trust in lying words that cannot profit will ye steal murder and commit adultery and swear falsely and burn incense unto baal and walk after other gods whom ye know not and come and stand before me in this house which is called by my name and say we are delivered to do all these abominations is this house which is called by my name become a den of robbers in your eyes behold even i have seen it saith the lord but go ye now unto my place which was in shiloh where i set my name at the first and see what i did to it for the wickedness of my people israel and now because ye have done all these works saith the lord and i spake unto you rising up early and speaking but ye heard not and i called you but ye answered not therefore will i do unto this house which is called by my name wherein ye trust and unto the place which i gave to you and to your fathers as i have done to shiloh and i will cast you out of my sight as i have cast out all your brethren even the whole seed of ephraim therefore pray not thou for this people neither lift up cry nor prayer for them neither make intercession to me for i will not hear thee seest thou not what they do in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem the children gather wood and the fathers kindle the fire and the women knead their dough to make cakes to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods that they may provoke me to anger do they provoke me to anger saith the lord do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces therefore thus saith the lord god behold mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place upon man and upon beast and upon the trees of the field and upon the fruit of the ground and it shall burn and shall not be quenched thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices and eat flesh for i spake not unto your fathers nor commanded them in the day that i brought them out of the land of egypt concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices but this thing commanded i them saying obey my voice and i will be your god and ye shall be my people and walk ye in all the ways that i have commanded you that it may be well unto you but they hearkened not nor inclined their ear but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart and went backward and not forward since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of egypt unto this day i have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets daily rising up early and sending them yet they hearkened not unto me nor inclined their ear but hardened their neck they did worse than their fathers therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them but they will not hearken to thee thou shalt also call unto them but they will not answer thee but thou shalt say unto them this is a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the lord their god nor receiveth correction truth is perished and is cut off from their mouth cut off thine hair o jerusalem and cast it away and take up a lamentation on high places for the lord hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath for the children of judah have done evil in my sight saith the lord they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name to pollute it and they have built the high places of
