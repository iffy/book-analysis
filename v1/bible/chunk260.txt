and athaliah did reign over the land and the seventh year jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds with the captains and the guard and brought them to him into the house of the lord and made a covenant with them and took an oath of them in the house of the lord and shewed them the kings son and he commanded them saying this is the thing that ye shall do a third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the kings house and a third part shall be at the gate of sur and a third part at the gate behind the guard so shall ye keep the watch of the house that it be not broken down and two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath even they shall keep the watch of the house of the lord about the king and ye shall compass the king round about every man with his weapons in his hand and he that cometh within the ranges let him be slain and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in and the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that jehoiada the priest commanded and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath with them that should go out on the sabbath and came to jehoiada the priest and to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king davids spears and shields that were in the temple of the lord and the guard stood every man with his weapons in his hand round about the king from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple along by the altar and the temple and he brought forth the kings son and put the crown upon him and gave him the testimony and they made him king and anointed him and they clapped their hands and said god save the king and when athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people she came to the people into the temple of the lord and when she looked behold the king stood by a pillar as the manner was and the princes and the trumpeters by the king and all the people of the land rejoiced and blew with trumpets and athaliah rent her clothes and cried treason treason but jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds the officers of the host and said unto them have her forth without the ranges and him that followeth her kill with the sword for the priest had said let her not be slain in the house of the lord and they laid hands on her and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the kings house and there was she slain and jehoiada made a covenant between the lord and the king and the people that they should be the lords people between the king also and the people and all the people of the land went into the house of baal and brake it down his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly and slew mattan the priest of baal before the altars and the priest appointed officers over the house of the lord and he took the rulers over hundreds and the captains and the guard and all the people of the land and they brought down the king from the house of the lord and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the kings house and he sat on the throne of the kings and all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was in quiet and they slew athaliah with the sword beside the kings house seven years old was jehoash when he began to reign in the seventh year of jehu jehoash began to reign and forty years reigned he in jerusalem and his mothers name was zibiah of beersheba and jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the lord all his days wherein jehoiada the priest instructed him but the high places were not taken away the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places and jehoash said to the priests all the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the lord even the money of every one that passeth the account the money that every man is set at and all the money that cometh into any mans heart to bring into the house of the lord let the priests take it to them every man of his acquaintance and let them repair the breaches of the house wheresoever any breach shall be found but it was so that in the three and twentieth year of king jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house then king jehoash called for jehoiada the priest and the other priests and said unto them why repair ye not the breaches of the house now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance but deliver it for the breaches of the house and the priests consented to receive no more money of the people neither to repair the breaches of the house but jehoiada the priest took a chest and bored a hole in the lid of it and set it beside the altar on the right side as one cometh into the house of the lord and the priests that kept the door put therein all the money that was brought into the house of the lord and it was so when they saw that there was much money in the chest that the kings scribe and the high priest came up and they put up in bags and told the money that was found in the house of the lord and they gave the money being told into the hands of them that did the work that had the oversight of the house of the lord and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders that wrought upon the house of the lord and to masons and hewers of stone and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the lord and for all that was laid
