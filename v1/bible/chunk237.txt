my name will i cast out of my sight and israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people and at this house which is high every one that passeth by it shall be astonished and shall hiss and they shall say why hath the lord done thus unto this land and to this house and they shall answer because they forsook the lord their god who brought forth their fathers out of the land of egypt and have taken hold upon other gods and have worshipped them and served them therefore hath the lord brought upon them all this evil and it came to pass at the end of twenty years when solomon had built the two houses the house of the lord and the kings house now hiram the king of tyre had furnished solomon with cedar trees and fir trees and with gold according to all his desire that then king solomon gave hiram twenty cities in the land of galilee and hiram came out from tyre to see the cities which solomon had given him and they pleased him not and he said what cities are these which thou hast given me my brother and he called them the land of cabul unto this day and hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold and this is the reason of the levy which king solomon raised for to build the house of the lord and his own house and millo and the wall of jerusalem and hazor and megiddo and gezer for pharaoh king of egypt had gone up and taken gezer and burnt it with fire and slain the canaanites that dwelt in the city and given it for a present unto his daughter solomons wife and solomon built gezer and bethhoron the nether and baalath and tadmor in the wilderness in the land and all the cities of store that solomon had and cities for his chariots and cities for his horsemen and that which solomon desired to build in jerusalem and in lebanon and in all the land of his dominion and all the people that were left of the amorites hittites perizzites hivites and jebusites which were not of the children of israel their children that were left after them in the land whom the children of israel also were not able utterly to destroy upon those did solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day but of the children of israel did solomon make no bondmen but they were men of war and his servants and his princes and his captains and rulers of his chariots and his horsemen these were the chief of the officers that were over solomons work five hundred and fifty which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work but pharaohs daughter came up out of the city of david unto her house which solomon had built for her then did he build millo and three times in a year did solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the lord and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the lord so he finished the house and king solomon made a navy of ships in eziongeber which is beside eloth on the shore of the red sea in the land of edom and hiram sent in the navy his servants shipmen that had knowledge of the sea with the servants of solomon and they came to ophir and fetched from thence gold four hundred and twenty talents and brought it to king solomon and when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomon concerning the name of the lord she came to prove him with hard questions and she came to jerusalem with a very great train with camels that bare spices and very much gold and precious stones and when she was come to solomon she communed with him of all that was in her heart and solomon told her all her questions there was not any thing hid from the king which he told her not and when the queen of sheba had seen all solomons wisdom and the house that he had built and the meat of his table and the sitting of his servants and the attendance of his ministers and their apparel and his cupbearers and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the lord there was no more spirit in her and she said to the king it was a true report that i heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom howbeit i believed not the words until i came and mine eyes had seen it and behold the half was not told me thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which i heard happy are thy men happy are these thy servants which stand continually before thee and that hear thy wisdom blessed be the lord thy god which delighted in thee to set thee on the throne of israel because the lord loved israel for ever therefore made he thee king to do judgment and justice and she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold and of spices very great store and precious stones there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of sheba gave to king solomon and the navy also of hiram that brought gold from ophir brought in from ophir great plenty of almug trees and precious stones and the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the lord and for the kings house harps also and psalteries for singers there came no such almug trees nor were seen unto this day and king solomon gave unto the queen of sheba all her desire whatsoever she asked beside that which solomon gave her of his royal bounty so she turned and went to her own country she and her servants now the weight of gold that came to solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold beside that he had of the merchantmen and of the traffick of the spice merchants and of all the kings of arabia and of the governors of the country and king solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold six hundred shekels of gold went
