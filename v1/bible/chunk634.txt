into everlasting life the woman saith unto him sir give me this water that i thirst not neither come hither to draw jesus saith unto her go call thy husband and come hither the woman answered and said i have no husband jesus said unto her thou hast well said i have no husband for thou hast had five husbands and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband in that saidst thou truly the woman saith unto him sir i perceive that thou art a prophet our fathers worshipped in this mountain and ye say that in jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship jesus saith unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth the woman saith unto him i know that messias cometh which is called christ when he is come he will tell us all things jesus saith unto her i that speak unto thee am he and upon this came his disciples and marvelled that he talked with the woman yet no man said what seekest thou or why talkest thou with her the woman then left her waterpot and went her way into the city and saith to the men come see a man which told me all things that ever i did is not this the christ then they went out of the city and came unto him in the mean while his disciples prayed him saying master eat but he said unto them i have meat to eat that ye know not of therefore said the disciples one to another hath any man brought him ought to eat jesus saith unto them my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work say not ye there are yet four months and then cometh harvest behold i say unto you lift up your eyes and look on the fields for they are white already to harvest and he that reapeth receiveth wages and gathereth fruit unto life eternal that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together and herein is that saying true one soweth and another reapeth i sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour other men laboured and ye are entered into their labours and many of the samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman which testified he told me all that ever i did so when the samaritans were come unto him they besought him that he would tarry with them and he abode there two days and many more believed because of his own word and said unto the woman now we believe not because of thy saying for we have heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the christ the saviour of the world now after two days he departed thence and went into galilee for jesus himself testified that a prophet hath no honour in his own country then when he was come into galilee the galilaeans received him having seen all the things that he did at jerusalem at the feast for they also went unto the feast so jesus came again into cana of galilee where he made the water wine and there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at capernaum when he heard that jesus was come out of judaea into galilee he went unto him and besought him that he would come down and heal his son for he was at the point of death then said jesus unto him except ye see signs and wonders ye will not believe the nobleman saith unto him sir come down ere my child die jesus saith unto him go thy way thy son liveth and the man believed the word that jesus had spoken unto him and he went his way and as he was now going down his servants met him and told him saying thy son liveth then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend and they said unto him yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him so the father knew that it was at the same hour in the which jesus said unto him thy son liveth and himself believed and his whole house this is again the second miracle that jesus did when he was come out of judaea into galilee after this there was a feast of the jews and jesus went up to jerusalem now there is at jerusalem by the sheep market a pool which is called in the hebrew tongue bethesda having five porches in these lay a great multitude of impotent folk of blind halt withered waiting for the moving of the water for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and troubled the water whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had and a certain man was there which had an infirmity thirty and eight years when jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time in that case he saith unto him wilt thou be made whole the impotent man answered him sir i have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool but while i am coming another steppeth down before me jesus saith unto him rise take up thy bed and walk and immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked and on the same day was the sabbath the jews therefore said unto him that was cured it is the sabbath day it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed he answered them he that made me whole the same said unto me take up thy bed and walk then asked they him what man is that which said unto thee take up thy bed and walk and he that
