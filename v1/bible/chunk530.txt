right side and when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward he measured a thousand cubits and he brought me through the waters the waters were to the ankles again he measured a thousand and brought me through the waters the waters were to the knees again he measured a thousand and brought me through the waters were to the loins afterward he measured a thousand and it was a river that i could not pass over for the waters were risen waters to swim in a river that could not be passed over and he said unto me son of man hast thou seen this then he brought me and caused me to return to the brink of the river now when i had returned behold at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other then said he unto me these waters issue out toward the east country and go down into the desert and go into the sea which being brought forth into the sea the waters shall be healed and it shall come to pass that every thing that liveth which moveth whithersoever the rivers shall come shall live and there shall be a very great multitude of fish because these waters shall come thither for they shall be healed and every thing shall live whither the river cometh and it shall come to pass that the fishers shall stand upon it from engedi even unto eneglaim they shall be a place to spread forth nets their fish shall be according to their kinds as the fish of the great sea exceeding many but the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not be healed they shall be given to salt and by the river upon the bank thereof on this side and on that side shall grow all trees for meat whose leaf shall not fade neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary and the fruit thereof shall be for meat and the leaf thereof for medicine thus saith the lord god this shall be the border whereby ye shall inherit the land according to the
