and him that is shut up and left in israel and will make thine house like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat and like the house of baasha the son of ahijah for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger and made israel to sin and of jezebel also spake the lord saying the dogs shall eat jezebel by the wall of jezreel him that dieth of ahab in the city the dogs shall eat and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat but there was none like unto ahab which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the lord whom jezebel his wife stirred up and he did very abominably in following idols according to all things as did the amorites whom the lord cast out before the children of israel and it came to pass when ahab heard those words that he rent his clothes and put sackcloth upon his flesh and fasted and lay in sackcloth and went softly and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite saying seest thou how ahab humbleth himself before me because he humbleth himself before me i will not bring the evil in his days but in his sons days will i bring the evil upon his house and they continued three years without war between syria and israel and it came to pass in the third year that jehoshaphat the king of judah came down to the king of israel and the king of israel said unto his servants know ye that ramoth in gilead is ours and we be still and take it not out of the hand of the king of syria and he said unto jehoshaphat wilt thou go with me to battle to ramothgilead and jehoshaphat said to the king of israel i am as thou art my people as thy people my horses as thy horses and jehoshaphat said unto the king of israel enquire i pray thee at the word of the lord to day then the king of israel gathered the prophets together about four hundred men and said unto them shall i go against ramothgilead to battle or shall i forbear and they said go up for the lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king and jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord besides that we might enquire of him and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat there is yet one man micaiah the son of imlah by whom we may enquire of the lord but i hate him for he doth not prophesy good concerning me but evil and jehoshaphat said let not the king say so then the king of israel called an officer and said hasten hither micaiah the son of imlah and the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah sat each on his throne having put on their robes in a void place in the entrance of the gate of samaria and all the prophets prophesied before them and zedekiah the son of chenaanah made him horns of iron and he said thus saith the lord with these shalt thou push the syrians until thou have consumed them and all the prophets prophesied so saying go up to ramothgilead and prosper for the lord shall deliver it into the kings hand and the messenger that was gone to call micaiah spake unto him saying behold now the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth let thy word i pray thee be like the word of one of them and speak that which is good and micaiah said as the lord liveth what the lord saith unto me that will i speak so he came to the king and the king said unto him micaiah shall we go against ramothgilead to battle or shall we forbear and he answered him go and prosper for the lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king and the king said unto him how many times shall i adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the lord and he said i saw all israel scattered upon the hills as sheep that have not a shepherd and the lord said these have no master let them return every man to his house in peace and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat did i not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me but evil and he said hear thou therefore the word of the lord i saw the lord sitting on his throne and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left and the lord said who shall persuade ahab that he may go up and fall at ramothgilead and one said on this manner and another said on that manner and there came forth a spirit and stood before the lord and said i will persuade him and the lord said unto him wherewith and he said i will go forth and i will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets and he said thou shalt persude him and prevail also go forth and do so now therefore behold the lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets and the lord hath spoken evil concerning thee but zedekiah the son of chenaanah went near and smote micaiah on the cheek and said which way went the spirit of the lord from me to speak unto thee and micaiah said behold thou shalt see in that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself and the king of israel said take micaiah and carry him back unto amon the governor of the city and to joash the kings son and say thus saith the king put this fellow in the prison and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until i come in peace and micaiah said if thou return at all in peace the lord hath not spoken by me and he said hearken o people every one of you so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up to ramothgilead and the king of
