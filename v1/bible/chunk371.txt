themselves in an evil matter they commune of laying snares privily they say who shall see them they search out iniquities they accomplish a diligent search both the inward thought of every one of them and the heart is deep but god shall shoot at them with an arrow suddenly shall they be wounded so they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves all that see them shall flee away and all men shall fear and shall declare the work of god for they shall wisely consider of his doing the righteous shall be glad in the lord and shall trust in him and all the upright in heart shall glory praise waiteth for thee o god in sion and unto thee shall the vow be performed o thou that hearest prayer unto thee shall all flesh come iniquities prevail against me as for our transgressions thou shalt
