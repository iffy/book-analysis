blood and blood shall pursue thee sith thou hast not hated blood even blood shall pursue thee thus will i make mount seir most desolate and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth and i will fill his mountains with his slain men in thy hills and in thy valleys and in all thy rivers shall they fall that are slain with the sword i will make thee perpetual desolations and thy cities shall not return and ye shall know that i am the lord because thou hast said these two nations and these two countries shall be mine and we will possess it whereas the lord was there therefore as i live saith the lord god i will even do according to thine anger and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them and i will make myself known among them when i have judged thee and thou shalt know that i am the lord and that i have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of israel saying they are laid desolate they are given us to consume thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me and have multiplied your words against me i have heard them thus saith the lord god when the whole earth rejoiceth i will make thee desolate as thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of israel because it was desolate so will i do unto thee thou shalt be desolate o mount seir and all idumea even all of it and they shall know that i am the lord also thou son of man prophesy unto the mountains of israel and say ye mountains of israel hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord god because the enemy hath said against you aha even the ancient high places are ours in possession therefore prophesy and say thus saith the lord god because they have made you desolate and swallowed you up on every side that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the heathen and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers and are an infamy of the people therefore ye mountains of israel hear the word of the lord god thus saith the lord god to the mountains and to the hills to the rivers and to the valleys to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken which became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that are round about therefore thus saith the lord god surely in the fire of my jealousy have i spoken against the residue of the heathen and against all idumea which have appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all their heart with despiteful minds to cast it out for a prey prophesy therefore concerning the land of israel and say unto the mountains and to the hills to the rivers and to the valleys thus saith the lord god behold i have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury because ye have borne the shame of the heathen therefore thus saith the lord god i have lifted up mine hand surely the heathen that are about you they shall bear their shame but ye o mountains of israel ye shall shoot forth your branches and yield your fruit to my people of israel for they are at hand to come for behold i am for you and i will turn unto you and ye shall be tilled and sown and i will multiply men upon you all the house of israel even all of it and the cities shall be inhabited and the wastes shall be builded and i will multiply upon you man and beast and they shall increase and bring fruit and i will settle you after your old estates and will do better unto you than at your beginnings and ye shall know that i am the lord yea i will cause men to walk upon you even my people israel and they shall possess thee and thou shalt be their inheritance and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of men thus saith the lord god because they say unto you thou land devourest up men and hast bereaved thy nations therefore thou shalt devour men no more neither bereave thy nations any more saith the lord god neither will i cause men to hear in thee the shame of the heathen any more neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any more neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more saith the lord god moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man when the house of israel dwelt in their own land they defiled it by their own way and by their doings their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman wherefore i poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land and for their idols wherewith they had polluted it and i scattered them among the heathen and they were dispersed through the countries according to their way and according to their doings i judged them and when they entered unto the heathen whither they went they profaned my holy name when they said to them these are the people of the lord and are gone forth out of his land but i had pity for mine holy name which the house of israel had profaned among the heathen whither they went therefore say unto the house of israel thus saith the lord god i do not this for your sakes o house of israel but for mine holy names sake which ye have profaned among the heathen whither ye went and i will sanctify my great name which was profaned among the heathen which ye have profaned in the midst of them and the heathen shall know that i am the lord saith the lord god when i shall be sanctified in you before their eyes for i will take you from among the heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land then will i sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols
