joab and amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway and when the man saw that all the people stood still he removed amasa out of the highway into the field and cast a cloth upon him when he saw that every one that came by him stood still when he was removed out of the highway all the people went on after joab to pursue after sheba the son of bichri and he went through all the tribes of israel unto abel and to bethmaachah and all the berites and they were gathered together and went also after him and they came and besieged him in abel of bethmaachah and they cast up a bank against the city and it stood in the trench and all the people that were with joab battered the wall to throw it down then cried a wise woman out of the city hear hear say i pray you unto joab come near hither that i may speak with thee and when he was come near unto her the woman said art thou joab and he answered i am he then she said unto him hear the words of thine handmaid and he answered i do hear then she spake saying they were wont to speak in old time saying they shall surely ask counsel at abel and so they ended the matter i am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in israel thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in israel why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the lord and joab answered and said far be it far be it from me that i should swallow up or destroy the matter is not so but a man of mount ephraim sheba the son of bichri by name hath lifted up his hand against the king even against david deliver him only and i will depart from the city and the woman said unto joab behold his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom and they cut off the head of sheba the son of bichri and cast it out to joab and he blew a trumpet and they retired from the city every man to his tent and joab returned to jerusalem unto the king now joab was over all the host of israel and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the cherethites and over the pelethites and adoram was over the tribute and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud was recorder and sheva was scribe and zadok and abiathar were the priests and ira also the jairite was a chief ruler about david then there was a famine in the days of david three years year after year and david enquired of the lord and the lord answered it is for saul and for his bloody house because he slew the gibeonites and the king called the gibeonites and said unto them now the gibeonites were not of the children of israel but of the remnant of the amorites and the children of israel had sworn unto them and saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of israel and judah wherefore david said unto the gibeonites what shall i do for you and wherewith shall i make the atonement that ye may bless the inheritance of the lord and the gibeonites said unto him we will have no silver nor gold of saul nor of his house neither for us shalt thou kill any man in israel and he said what ye shall say that will i do for you and they answered the king the man that consumed us and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of israel let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us and we will hang them up unto the lord in gibeah of saul whom the lord did choose and the king said i will give them but the king spared mephibosheth the son of jonathan the son of saul because of the lords oath that was between them between david and jonathan the son of saul but the king took the two sons of rizpah the daughter of aiah whom she bare unto saul armoni and mephibosheth and the five sons of michal the daughter of saul whom she brought up for adriel the son of barzillai the meholathite and he delivered them into the hands of the gibeonites and they hanged them in the hill before the lord and they fell all seven together and were put to death in the days of harvest in the first days in the beginning of barley harvest and rizpah the daughter of aiah took sackcloth and spread it for her upon the rock from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day nor the beasts of the field by night and it was told david what rizpah the daughter of aiah the concubine of saul had done and david went and took the bones of saul and the bones of jonathan his son from the men of jabeshgilead which had stolen them from the street of bethshan where the philistines had hanged them when the philistines had slain saul in gilboa and he brought up from thence the bones of saul and the bones of jonathan his son and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged and the bones of saul and jonathan his son buried they in the country of benjamin in zelah in the sepulchre of kish his father and they performed all that the king commanded and after that god was intreated for the land moreover the philistines had yet war again with israel and david went down and his servants with him and fought against the philistines and david waxed faint and ishbibenob which was of the sons of the giant the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight he being girded with a new sword thought to have slain david but abishai the son of zeruiah succoured him and smote the philistine and killed him then the men of david sware unto him saying thou shalt go no
