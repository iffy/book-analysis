prudent and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it but the instruction of fools is folly the heart of the wise teacheth his mouth and addeth learning to his lips pleasant words are as an honeycomb sweet to the soul and health to the bones there is a way that seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death he that laboureth laboureth for himself for his mouth craveth it of him an ungodly man diggeth up evil and in his lips there is as a burning fire a froward man soweth strife and a whisperer separateth chief friends a violent man enticeth his neighbour and leadeth him into the way that is not good he shutteth his eyes to devise froward things moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass the hoary head is a crown of glory if it be found in the way of righteousness he that is slow to anger is better than the mighty and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city the lot is cast into the lap but the whole disposing thereof is of the lord better is a dry morsel and quietness therewith than an house full of sacrifices with strife a wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren the fining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold but the lord trieth the hearts a wicked doer giveth heed to false lips and a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his maker and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished childrens children are the crown of old men and the glory of children are their fathers excellent speech becometh not a fool much less do lying lips a prince a gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it whithersoever it turneth it prospereth he that covereth a transgression seeketh love but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends a reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool an evil man seeketh only rebellion therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man rather than a fool in his folly whoso rewardeth evil for good evil shall not depart from his house the beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water therefore leave off contention before it be meddled with he that justifieth the wicked and he that condemneth the just even they both are abomination to the lord wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom seeing he hath no heart to it a friend loveth at all times and a brother is born for adversity a man void of understanding striketh hands and becometh surety in the presence of his friend he loveth transgression that loveth strife and he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction he that hath a froward heart findeth no good and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief he that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow and the father of a fool hath no joy a merry heart doeth good like a medicine but a broken spirit drieth the bones a wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment wisdom is before him that hath understanding but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth a foolish son is a grief to his father and bitterness to her that bare him also to punish the just is not good nor to strike princes for equity he that hath knowledge spareth his words and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit even a fool when he holdeth his peace is counted wise and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding through desire a man having separated himself seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom a fool hath no delight in understanding but that his heart may discover itself when the wicked cometh then cometh also contempt and with ignominy reproach the words of a mans mouth are as deep waters and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook it is not good to accept the person of the wicked to overthrow the righteous in judgment a fools lips enter into contention and his mouth calleth for strokes a fools mouth is his destruction and his lips are the snare of his soul the words of a talebearer are as wounds and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly he also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster the name of the lord is a strong tower the righteous runneth into it and is safe the rich mans wealth is his strong city and as an high wall in his own conceit before destruction the heart of man is haughty and before honour is humility he that answereth a matter before he heareth it it is folly and shame unto him the spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity but a wounded spirit who can bear the heart of the prudent getteth knowledge and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge a mans gift maketh room for him and bringeth him before great men he that is first in his own cause seemeth just but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him the lot causeth contentions to cease and parteth between the mighty a brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city and their contentions are like the bars of a castle a mans belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing and obtaineth favour of the lord the poor useth intreaties but the rich answereth roughly a man that hath friends must shew himself friendly and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother better is the poor that walketh in his
