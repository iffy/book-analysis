it an house in the land of shinar and it shall be established and set there upon her own base and i turned and lifted up mine eyes and looked and behold there came four chariots out from between two mountains and the mountains were mountains of brass in the first chariot were red horses and in the second chariot black horses and in the third chariot white horses and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses then i answered and said unto the angel that talked with me what are these my lord and the angel answered and said unto me these are the four spirits of the heavens which go forth from standing before the lord of all the earth the black horses which are therein go forth into the north country and the white go forth after them and the grisled go forth toward the south country and the bay went forth and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth and he said get you hence walk to and fro through the earth so they walked to and fro through the earth then cried he upon me and spake unto me saying behold these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country and the word of the lord came unto me saying take of them of the captivity even of heldai of tobijah and of jedaiah which are come from babylon and come thou the same day and go into the house of josiah the son of zephaniah then take silver and gold and make crowns and set them upon the head of joshua the son of josedech the high priest and speak unto him saying thus speaketh the lord of hosts saying behold the man whose name is the branch and he shall grow up out of his place and he shall build the temple of the lord even he shall build the temple of the lord and he shall bear the glory and shall sit and rule upon his throne and he shall be a priest upon his throne and the counsel of peace shall be between them both and the crowns shall be to helem and to tobijah and to jedaiah and to hen the son of zephaniah for a memorial in the temple of the lord and they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the lord and ye shall know that the lord of hosts hath sent me unto you and this shall come to pass if ye will diligently obey the voice of the lord your god and it came to pass in the fourth year of king darius that the word of the lord came unto zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month even in chisleu when they had sent unto the house of god sherezer and regemmelech and their men to pray before the lord and to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the lord of hosts and to the prophets saying should i weep in the fifth month separating myself as i have done these so many years then came the word of the lord of hosts unto me saying speak unto all the people of the land and to the priests saying when ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month even those seventy years did ye at all fast unto me even to me and when ye did eat and when ye did drink did not ye eat for yourselves and drink for yourselves should ye not hear the words which the lord hath cried by the former prophets when jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity and the cities thereof round about her when men inhabited the south and the plain and the word of the lord came unto zechariah saying thus speaketh the lord of hosts saying execute true judgment and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother and oppress not the widow nor the fatherless the stranger nor the poor and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart but they refused to hearken and pulled away the shoulder and stopped their ears that they should not hear yea they made their hearts as an adamant stone lest they should hear the law and the words which the lord of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets
