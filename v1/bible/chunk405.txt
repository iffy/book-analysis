wisdom of thy words remove not the old landmark and enter not into the fields of the fatherless for their redeemer is mighty he shall plead their cause with thee apply thine heart unto instruction and thine ears to the words of knowledge withhold not correction from the child for if thou beatest him with the rod he shall not die thou shalt beat him with the rod and shalt deliver his soul from hell my son if thine heart be wise my heart shall rejoice even mine yea my reins shall rejoice when thy lips speak right things let not thine heart envy sinners but be thou in the fear of the lord all the day long for surely there is an end and thine expectation shall not be cut off hear thou my son and be wise and guide thine heart in the way be not among winebibbers among riotous eaters of flesh for the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags hearken unto thy father that begat thee and despise not thy mother when she is old buy the truth and sell it not also wisdom and instruction and understanding the father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice and he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him thy father and thy mother shall be glad and she that bare thee shall rejoice my son give me thine heart and let thine eyes observe my ways for a whore is a deep ditch and a strange woman is a narrow pit she also lieth in wait as for a prey and increaseth the transgressors among men who hath woe who hath sorrow who hath contentions who hath babbling who hath wounds without cause who hath redness of eyes they that tarry long at the wine they that go to seek mixed wine look not thou upon the wine when it is red when it giveth his colour in the cup when it moveth itself aright at the last it biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an adder thine eyes shall behold strange women and thine heart shall utter perverse things yea thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast they have stricken me shalt thou say and i was not sick they have beaten me and i felt it not when shall i awake i will seek it yet again be not thou envious against evil men neither desire to be with them for their heart studieth destruction and their lips talk of mischief through wisdom is an house builded and by understanding it is established and by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches a wise man is strong yea a man of knowledge increaseth strength for by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war and in multitude of counsellors there is safety wisdom is too high for a fool he openeth not his mouth in the gate he that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person the thought of foolishness is sin and the scorner is an abomination to men if thou faint in the day of adversity thy strength is small if thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death and those that are ready to be slain if thou sayest behold we knew it not doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it and he that keepeth thy soul doth not he know it and shall not he render to every man according to his works my son eat thou honey because it is good and the honeycomb which is sweet to thy taste so shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul when thou hast found it then there shall be a reward and thy expectation shall not be cut off lay not wait o wicked man against the dwelling of the righteous spoil not his resting place for a just man falleth seven times and riseth up again but the wicked shall fall into mischief rejoice not when thine enemy falleth and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth lest the lord see it and it displease him and he turn away his wrath from him fret not thyself because of evil men neither be thou envious at the wicked for there shall be no reward to the evil man the candle of the wicked shall be put out my son fear thou the lord and the king and meddle not with them that are given to change for their calamity shall rise suddenly and who knoweth the ruin of them both these things also belong to the wise it is not good to have respect of persons in judgment he that saith unto the wicked thou are
