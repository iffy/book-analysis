from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee thou mayest not set a stranger over thee which is not thy brother but he shall not multiply horses to himself nor cause the people to return to egypt to the end that he should multiply horses forasmuch as the lord hath said unto you ye shall henceforth return no more that way neither shall he multiply wives to himself that his heart turn not away neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold and it shall be when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the levites and it shall be with him and he shall read therein all the days of his life that he may learn to fear the lord his god to keep all the words of this law and these statutes to do them that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren and that he turn not aside from the commandment to the right hand or to the left to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom he and his children in the midst of israel the priests the levites and all the tribe of levi shall have no part nor inheritance with israel they shall eat the offerings of the lord made by fire and his inheritance therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren the lord is their inheritance as he hath said unto them and this shall be the priests due from the people from them that offer a sacrifice whether it be ox or sheep and they shall give unto the priest the shoulder and the two cheeks and the maw the firstfruit also of thy corn of thy wine and of thine oil and the first of the fleece of thy sheep shalt thou give him for the lord thy god hath chosen him out of all thy tribes to stand to minister in the name of the lord him and his sons for ever and if a levite come from any of thy gates out of all israel where he sojourned and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place which the lord shall choose then he shall minister in the name of the lord his god as all his brethren the levites do which stand there before the lord they shall have like portions to eat beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony when thou art come into the land which the lord thy god giveth thee thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations there shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire or that useth divination or an observer of times or an enchanter or a witch or a charmer or a consulter with familiar spirits or a wizard or a necromancer for all that do these things are an abomination unto the lord and because of these abominations the lord thy god doth drive them out from before thee thou shalt be perfect with the lord thy god for these nations which thou shalt possess hearkened unto observers of times and unto diviners but as for thee the lord thy god hath not suffered thee so to do the lord thy god will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee of thy brethren like unto me unto him ye shall hearken according to all that thou desiredst of the lord thy god in horeb in the day of the assembly saying let me not hear again the voice of the lord my god neither let me see this great fire any more that i die not and the lord said unto me they have well spoken that which they have spoken i will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren like unto thee and will put my words in his mouth and he shall speak unto them all that i shall command him and it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name i will require it of him but the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my name which i have not commanded him to speak or that shall speak in the name of other gods even that prophet shall die and if thou say in thine heart how shall we know the word which the lord hath not spoken when a prophet speaketh in the name of the lord if the thing follow not nor come to pass that is the thing which the lord hath not spoken but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously thou shalt not be afraid of him when the lord thy god hath cut off the nations whose land the lord thy god giveth thee and thou succeedest them and dwellest in their cities and in their houses thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land which the lord thy god giveth thee to possess it thou shalt prepare thee a way and divide the coasts of thy land which the lord thy god giveth thee to inherit into three parts that every slayer may flee thither and this is the case of the slayer which shall flee thither that he may live whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly whom he hated not in time past as when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree and the head slippeth from the helve and lighteth upon his neighbour that he die he shall flee unto one of those cities and live lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer while his heart is hot and overtake him because the way is long and slay him whereas he was not worthy of death inasmuch as he hated him not in time past wherefore i command thee saying thou shalt separate three cities for thee and if the lord thy god enlarge thy coast as he hath sworn unto thy fathers and give thee all the land which he promised to give
