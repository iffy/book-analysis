mount ephraim be too narrow for thee and the children of joseph said the hill is not enough for us and all the canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron both they who are of bethshean and her towns and they who are of the valley of jezreel and joshua spake unto the house of joseph even to ephraim and to manasseh saying thou art a great people and hast great power thou shalt not have one lot only but the mountain shall be thine for it is a wood and thou shalt cut it down and the outgoings of it shall be thine for thou shalt drive out the canaanites though they have iron chariots and though they be strong and the whole congregation of the children of israel assembled together at shiloh and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there and the land was subdued before them and there remained among the children of israel seven tribes which had not yet received their inheritance and joshua said unto the children of israel how long are ye slack to go to possess the land which the lord god of your fathers hath given you give out from among you three men for each tribe and i will send them and they shall rise and go through the land and describe it according to the inheritance of them and they shall come again to me and they shall divide it into seven parts judah shall abide in their coast on the south and the house of joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts and bring the description hither to me that i may cast lots for you here before the lord our god but the levites have no part among you for the priesthood of the lord is their inheritance and gad and reuben and half the tribe of manasseh have received their inheritance beyond jordan on the east which moses the servant of the lord gave them and the men arose and went away and joshua charged them that went to describe the land saying go and walk through the land and describe it and come again to me that i may here cast lots for you before the lord in shiloh and the men went and passed through the land and described it by cities into seven parts in a book and came again to joshua to the host at shiloh and joshua cast lots for
