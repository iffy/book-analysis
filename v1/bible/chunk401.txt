delivereth souls but a deceitful witness speaketh lies in the fear of the lord is strong confidence and his children shall have a place of refuge the fear of the lord is a fountain of life to depart from the snares of death in the multitude of people is the kings honour but in the want of people is the destruction of the prince he that is slow to wrath is of great understanding but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly a sound heart is the life of the flesh but envy the rottenness of the bones he that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his maker but he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor the wicked is driven away in his wickedness but the righteous hath hope in his death wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding but that which is in the midst of fools is made known righteousness exalteth a nation but sin is a reproach to any people the kings favour is toward a wise servant but his wrath is against him that causeth shame a soft answer turneth away wrath but grievous words stir up anger the tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness the eyes of the lord are in every place beholding the evil and the good a wholesome tongue is a tree of life but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit a fool despiseth his fathers instruction but he that regardeth reproof is prudent in the house of the righteous is much treasure but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble the lips of the wise disperse knowledge but the heart of the foolish doeth not so the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the lord but the prayer of the upright is his delight the way of the wicked is an abomination unto the lord but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way and he that hateth reproof shall die hell and destruction are before the lord how much more then the hearts of the children of men a scorner loveth not one that reproveth him neither will he go unto the wise a merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken the heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness all the days of the afflicted are evil but he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast better is little with the fear of the lord than great treasure and trouble therewith better is a dinner of herbs where love is than a stalled ox and hatred therewith a wrathful man stirreth up strife but he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife the way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns but the way of the righteous is made plain a wise son maketh a glad father but a foolish man despiseth his mother folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom but a man of understanding walketh uprightly without counsel purposes are disappointed but in the multitude of counsellors they are established a man hath joy by the answer of his mouth and a word spoken in due season how good is it the way of life is above to the wise that he may depart from hell beneath the lord will destroy the house of the proud but he will establish the border of the widow the thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the lord but the words of the pure are pleasant words he that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house but he that hateth gifts shall live the heart of the righteous studieth to answer but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things the lord is far from the wicked but he heareth the prayer of the righteous the light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart and a good report maketh the bones fat the ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise he that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding the fear of the lord is the instruction of wisdom and before honour is humility the preparations of the heart in man and the answer of the tongue is from the lord all the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes but the lord weigheth the spirits commit thy works unto the lord and thy thoughts shall be established the lord hath made all things for himself yea even the wicked for the day of evil every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the lord though hand join in hand he shall not be unpunished by mercy and truth iniquity is purged and by the fear of the lord men depart from evil when a mans ways please the lord he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right a mans heart deviseth his way but the lord directeth his steps a divine sentence is in the lips of the king his mouth transgresseth not in judgment a just weight and balance are the lords all the weights of the bag are his work it is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness for the throne is established by righteousness righteous lips are the delight of kings and they love him that speaketh right the wrath of a king is as messengers of death but a wise man will pacify it in the light of the kings countenance is life and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain how much better is it to get wisdom than gold and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver the highway of the upright is to depart from evil he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul pride goeth before destruction and an haughty spirit before a fall better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly than to divide the spoil with the proud he that handleth a matter wisely shall find good and whoso trusteth in the lord happy is he the wise in heart shall be called
