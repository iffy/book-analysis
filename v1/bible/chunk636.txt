and entered into a ship and went over the sea toward capernaum and it was now dark and jesus was not come to them and the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew so when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs they see jesus walking on the sea and drawing nigh unto the ship and they were afraid but he saith unto them it is i be not afraid then they willingly received him into the ship and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went the day following when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there save that one whereinto his disciples were entered and that jesus went not with his disciples into the boat but that his disciples were gone away alone howbeit there came other boats from tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread after that the lord had given thanks when the people therefore saw that jesus was not there neither his disciples they also took shipping and came to capernaum seeking for jesus and when they had found him on the other side of the sea they said unto him rabbi when camest thou hither jesus answered them and said verily verily i say unto you ye seek me not because ye saw the miracles but because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled labour not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath god the father sealed then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of god jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of god that ye believe on him whom he hath sent they said therefore unto him what sign shewest thou then that we may see and believe thee what dost thou work our fathers did eat manna in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from heaven to eat then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world then said they unto him lord evermore give us this bread and jesus said unto them i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst but i said unto you that ye also have seen me and believe not all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out for i came down from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the fathers will which hath sent me that of all which he hath given me i should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that every one which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i will raise him up at the last day the jews then murmured at him because he said i am the bread which came down from heaven and they said is not this jesus the son of joseph whose father and mother we know how is it then that he saith i came down from heaven jesus therefore answered and said unto them murmur not among yourselves no man can come to me except the father which hath sent me draw him and i will raise him up at the last day it is written in the prophets and they shall be all taught of god every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh unto me not that any man hath seen the father save he which is of god he hath seen the father verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life i am that bread of life your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die i am the living bread which came down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever and the bread that i will give is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world the jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you except ye eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and i in him as the living father hath sent me and i live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat manna and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever these things said he in the synagogue as he taught in capernaum many therefore of his disciples when they had heard this said this is an hard saying who can hear it when jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them doth this offend you what and if ye shall see the son of man ascend up where he was before it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life but there are some of you that believe not for jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not and who should betray him and he said therefore said i unto you that no man can come
