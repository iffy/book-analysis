shining round about me and them which journeyed with me and when we were all fallen to the earth i heard a voice speaking unto me and saying in the hebrew tongue saul saul why persecutest thou me it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks and i said who art thou lord and he said i am jesus whom thou persecutest but rise and stand upon thy feet for i have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen and of those things in the which i will appear unto thee delivering thee from the people and from the gentiles unto whom now i send thee to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me whereupon o king agrippa i was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision but shewed first unto them of damascus and at jerusalem and throughout all the coasts of judaea and then to the gentiles that they should repent and turn to god and do works meet for repentance for these causes the jews caught me in the temple and went about to kill me having therefore obtained help of god i continue unto this day witnessing both to small and great saying none other things than those which the prophets and moses did say should come that christ should suffer and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead and should shew light unto the people and to the gentiles and as he thus spake for himself festus said with a loud voice paul thou art beside thyself much learning doth make thee mad but he said i am not mad most noble festus but speak forth the words of truth and soberness for the king knoweth of these things before whom also i speak freely for i am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him for this thing was not done in a corner king agrippa believest thou the prophets i know that thou believest then agrippa said unto paul almost thou persuadest me to be a christian and paul said i would to god that not only thou but also all that hear me this day were both almost and altogether such as i am except these bonds and when he had thus spoken the king rose up and the governor and bernice and they that sat with them and when they were gone aside they talked between themselves saying this man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds then said agrippa unto festus this man might have been set at liberty if he had not appealed unto caesar and when it was determined that we should sail into italy they delivered paul and certain other prisoners unto one named julius a centurion of augustus band and entering into a ship of adramyttium we launched meaning to sail by the coasts of asia one aristarchus a macedonian of thessalonica being with us and the next day we touched at sidon and julius courteously entreated paul and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself and when we had launched from thence we sailed under cyprus because the winds were contrary and when we had sailed over the sea of cilicia and pamphylia we came to myra a city of lycia and there the centurion found a ship of alexandria sailing into italy and he put us therein and when we had sailed slowly many days and scarce were come over against cnidus the wind not suffering us we sailed under crete over against salmone and hardly passing it came unto a place which is called the fair havens nigh whereunto was the city of lasea now when much time was spent and when sailing was now dangerous because the fast was now already past paul admonished them and said unto them sirs i perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage not only of the lading and ship but also of our lives nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship more than those things which were spoken by paul and because the haven was not commodious to winter in the more part advised to depart thence also if by any means they might attain to phenice and there to winter which is an haven of crete and lieth toward the south west and north west and when the south wind blew softly supposing that they had obtained their purpose loosing thence they sailed close by crete but not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind called euroclydon and when the ship was caught and could not bear up into the wind we let her drive and running under a certain island which is called clauda we had much work to come by the boat which when they had taken up they used helps undergirding the ship and fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands strake sail and so were driven and we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest the next day they lightened the ship and the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship and when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared and no small tempest lay on us all hope that we should be saved was then taken away but after long abstinence paul stood forth in the midst of them and said sirs ye should have hearkened unto me and not have loosed from crete and to have gained this harm and loss and now i exhort you to be of good cheer for there shall be no loss of any mans life among you but of the ship for there stood by me this night the angel of god whose i am and whom i serve saying fear not paul thou must be brought before caesar and lo god hath given thee all them that sail with thee wherefore sirs be of good cheer for i believe god that it shall be even as it was told me howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island but when
