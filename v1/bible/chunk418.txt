and upon all the high mountains and upon all the hills that are lifted up and upon every high tower and upon every fenced wall and upon all the ships of tarshish and upon all pleasant pictures and the loftiness of man shall be bowed down and the haughtiness of men shall be made low and the lord alone shall be exalted in that day and the idols he shall utterly abolish and they shall go into the holes of the rocks and into the caves of the earth for fear of the lord and for the glory of his majesty when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth in that day a man shall cast his idols of silver and his idols of gold which they made each one for himself to worship to the moles and to the bats to go into the clefts of the rocks and into the tops of the ragged rocks for fear of the lord and for the glory of his majesty when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth cease ye from man whose breath is in his nostrils for wherein is he to be accounted of for behold the lord the lord of hosts doth take away from jerusalem and from judah the stay and the staff the whole stay of bread and the whole stay of water the mighty man and the man of war the judge and the prophet and the prudent and the ancient the captain of fifty and the honourable man and the counsellor and the cunning artificer and the eloquent orator and i will give children to be their princes and babes shall rule over them and the people shall be oppressed every one by another and every one by his neighbour the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient and the base against the honourable when a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father saying thou hast clothing be thou our ruler and let this ruin be under thy hand in that day shall he swear saying i will not be an healer for in my house is neither bread nor clothing make me not a ruler of the people for jerusalem is ruined and judah is fallen because their tongue and their doings are against the lord to provoke the eyes of his glory the shew of their countenance doth witness against them and they declare their sin as sodom they hide it not woe unto their soul for they have rewarded evil unto themselves say ye to the righteous that it shall be well with him for they shall eat the fruit of their doings woe unto the wicked it shall be ill with him for the reward of his hands shall be given him as for my people children are their oppressors and women rule over them o my people they which lead thee cause thee to err and destroy the way of thy paths the lord standeth up to plead and standeth to judge the people the lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people and the princes thereof for ye have eaten up the vineyard the spoil of the poor is in your houses what mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces and grind the faces of the poor saith the lord god of hosts moreover the lord saith because the daughters of zion are haughty and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes walking and mincing as they go and making a tinkling with their feet therefore the lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of zion and the lord will discover their secret parts in that day the lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet and their cauls and their round tires like the moon the chains and the bracelets and the mufflers the bonnets and the ornaments of the legs and the headbands and the tablets and the earrings the rings and nose jewels the changeable suits of apparel and the mantles and the wimples and the crisping pins the glasses and the fine linen and the hoods and the vails and it shall come to pass that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink and instead of a girdle a rent and instead of well set hair baldness and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth and burning instead of beauty thy men shall fall by the sword and thy mighty in the war and her gates shall lament and mourn and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach in that day shall the branch of the lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of israel and it shall come to pass that he that is left in zion and he that remaineth in jerusalem shall be called holy even every one that is written among the living in jerusalem when the lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of zion and shall have purged the blood of jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning and the lord will create upon every dwelling place of mount zion and upon her assemblies a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night for upon all the glory shall be a defence and there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day time from the heat and for a place of refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain now will i sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard my wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill and he fenced it and gathered out the stones thereof and planted it with the choicest vine and built a tower in the midst of it and also made a winepress therein and he looked that it should bring forth grapes and it brought forth wild grapes and now o inhabitants
