for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your redemption draweth nigh and he spake to them a parable behold the fig tree and all the trees when they now shoot forth ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand so likewise ye when ye see these things come to pass know ye that the kingdom of god is nigh at hand verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away and take heed to yourselves lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and cares of this life and so that day come upon you unawares for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth watch ye therefore and pray always that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man and in the day time he was teaching in the temple and at night he went out and abode in the mount that is called the mount of olives and all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple for to hear him now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh which is called the passover and the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him for they feared the people then entered satan into judas surnamed iscariot being of the number of the twelve and he went his way and communed with the chief priests and captains how he might betray him unto them and they were glad and covenanted to give him money and he promised and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude then came the day of unleavened bread when the passover must be killed and he sent peter and john saying go and prepare us the passover that we may eat and they said unto him where wilt thou that we prepare and he said unto them behold when ye are entered into the city there shall a man meet you bearing a pitcher of water follow him into the house where he entereth in and ye shall say unto the goodman of the house the master saith unto thee where is the guestchamber where i shall eat the passover with my disciples and he shall shew you a large upper room furnished there make ready and they went and found as he had said unto them and they made ready the passover and when the hour was come he sat down and the twelve apostles with him and he said unto them with desire i have desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer for i say unto you i will not any more eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of god and he took the cup and gave thanks and said take this and divide it among yourselves for i say unto you i will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of god shall come and he took bread and gave thanks and brake it and gave unto them saying this is my body which is given for you this do in remembrance of me likewise also the cup after supper saying this cup is the new testament in my blood which is shed for you but behold the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table and truly the son of man goeth as it was determined but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed and they began to enquire among themselves which of them it was that should do this thing and there was also a strife among them which of them should be accounted the greatest and he said unto them the kings of the gentiles exercise lordship over them and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors but ye shall not be so but he that is greatest among you let him be as the younger and he that is chief as he that doth serve for whether is greater he that sitteth at meat or he that serveth is not he that sitteth at meat but i am among you as he that serveth ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations and i appoint unto you a kingdom as my father hath appointed unto me that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel and the lord said simon simon behold satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat but i have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren and he said unto him lord i am ready to go with thee both into prison and to death and he said i tell thee peter the cock shall not crow this day before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me and he said unto them when i sent you without purse and scrip and shoes lacked ye any thing and they said nothing then said he unto them but now he that hath a purse let him take it and likewise his scrip and he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one for i say unto you that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me and he was reckoned among the transgressors for the things concerning me have an end and they said lord behold here are two swords and he said unto them it is enough and he came out and went as he was wont to the mount of olives and his disciples also followed him and when he was at the place he said unto them pray that ye enter not into temptation and he was withdrawn from them
