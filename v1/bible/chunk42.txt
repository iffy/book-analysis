to morrow about this time i will cause it to rain a very grievous hail such as hath not been in egypt since the foundation thereof even until now send therefore now and gather thy cattle and all that thou hast in the field for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field and shall not be brought home the hail shall come down upon them and they shall die he that feared the word of the lord among the servants of pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses and he that regarded not the word of the lord left his servants and his cattle in the field and the lord said unto moses stretch forth thine hand toward heaven that there may be hail in all the land of egypt upon man and upon beast and upon every herb of the field throughout the land of egypt and moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven and the lord sent thunder and hail and the fire ran along upon the ground and the lord rained hail upon the land of egypt so there was hail and fire mingled with the hail very grievous such as there was none like it in all the land of egypt since it became a nation and the hail smote throughout all the land of egypt all that was in the field both man and beast and the hail smote every herb of the field and brake every tree of the field only in the land of goshen where the children of israel were was there no hail and pharaoh sent and called for moses and aaron and said unto them i have sinned this time the lord is righteous and i and my people are wicked intreat the lord for it is enough that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail and i will let you go and ye shall stay no longer and moses said unto him as soon as i am gone out of the city i will spread abroad my hands unto the lord and the thunder shall cease neither shall there be any more hail that thou mayest know how that the earth is the lords but as for thee and thy servants i know that ye will not yet fear the lord god and the flax and the barley was smitten for the barley was in the ear and the flax was bolled but the wheat and the rie were not smitten for they were not grown up and moses went out of the city from pharaoh and spread abroad his hands unto the lord and the thunders and hail ceased and the rain was not poured upon the earth and when pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased he sinned yet more and hardened his heart he and his servants and the heart of pharaoh was hardened neither would he let the children of israel go as the lord had spoken by moses and the lord said unto moses go in unto pharaoh for i have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants that i might shew these my signs before him and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son and of thy sons son what things i have wrought in egypt and my signs which i have done among them that ye may know how that i am the lord and moses and aaron came in unto pharaoh and said unto him thus saith the lord god of the hebrews how long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me let my people go that they may serve me else if thou refuse to let my people go behold to morrow will i bring the locusts into thy coast and they shall cover the face of the earth that one cannot be able to see the earth and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped which remaineth unto you from the hail and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field and they shall fill thy houses and the houses of all thy servants and the houses of all the egyptians which neither thy fathers nor thy fathers fathers have seen since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day and he turned himself and went out from pharaoh and pharaohs servants said unto him how long shall this man be a snare unto us let the men go that they may serve the lord their god knowest thou not yet that egypt is destroyed and moses and aaron were brought again unto pharaoh and he said unto them go serve the lord your god but who are they that shall go and moses said we will go with our young and with our old with our sons and with our daughters with our flocks and with our herds will we go for we must hold a feast unto the lord and he said unto them let the lord be so with you as i will let you go and your little ones look to it for evil is before you not so go now ye that are men and serve the lord for that ye did desire and they were driven out from pharaohs presence and the lord said unto moses stretch out thine hand over the land of egypt for the locusts that they may come up upon the land of egypt and eat every herb of the land even all that the hail hath left and moses stretched forth his rod over the land of egypt and the lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all that night and when it was morning the east wind brought the locusts and the locust went up over all the land of egypt and rested in all the coasts of egypt very grievous were they before them there were no such locusts as they neither after them shall be such for they covered the face of the whole earth so that the land was darkened and they did eat every herb of the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left and there remained not any green thing in the trees or in the herbs of
