yea the wall of babylon shall fall my people go ye out of the midst of her and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the lord and lest your heart faint and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land a rumour shall both come one year and after that in another year shall come a rumour and violence in the land ruler against ruler therefore behold the days come that i will do judgment upon the graven images of babylon and her whole land shall be confounded and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her then the heaven and the earth and all that is therein shall sing for babylon for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north saith the lord as babylon hath caused the slain of israel to fall so at babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth ye that have escaped the sword go away stand not still remember the lord afar off and let jerusalem come into your mind we are confounded because we have heard reproach shame hath covered our faces for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the lords house wherefore behold the days come saith the lord that i will do judgment upon her graven images and through all her land the wounded shall groan though babylon should mount up to heaven and though she should fortify the height of her strength yet from me shall spoilers come unto her saith the lord a sound of a cry cometh from babylon and great destruction from the land of the chaldeans because the lord hath spoiled babylon and destroyed out of her the great voice when her waves do roar like great waters a noise of their voice is uttered because the spoiler is come upon her even upon babylon and her mighty men are taken every one of their bows is broken for the lord god of recompences shall surely requite and i will make drunk her princes and her wise men her captains and her rulers and her mighty men and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake saith the king whose name is the lord of hosts thus saith the lord of hosts the broad walls of babylon shall be utterly broken and her high gates shall be burned with fire and the people shall labour in vain and the folk in the fire and they shall be weary the word which jeremiah the prophet commanded seraiah the son of neriah the son of maaseiah when he went with zedekiah the king of judah into babylon in the fourth year of his reign and this seraiah was a quiet prince so jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon babylon even all these words that are written against babylon and jeremiah said to seraiah when thou comest to babylon and shalt see and shalt read all these words then shalt thou say o lord thou hast spoken against this place to cut it off that none shall remain in it neither man nor beast but that it shall be desolate for ever and it shall be when thou hast made an end of reading this book that thou shalt bind a stone to it and cast it into the midst of euphrates and thou shalt say thus shall babylon sink and shall not rise from the evil that i will bring upon her and they shall be weary thus far are the words of jeremiah zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and his mothers name was hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah and he did that which was evil in the eyes of the lord according to all that jehoiakim had done for through the anger of the lord it came to pass in jerusalem and judah till he had cast them out from his presence that zedekiah rebelled against the king of babylon and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign in the tenth month in the tenth day of the month that nebuchadrezzar king of babylon came he and all his army against jerusalem and pitched against it and built forts against it round about so the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king zedekiah and in the fourth month in the ninth day of the month the famine was sore in the city so that there was no bread for the people of the land then the city was broken up and all the men of war fled and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls which was by the kings garden now the chaldeans were by the city round about and they went by the way of the plain but the army of the chaldeans pursued after the king and overtook zedekiah in the plains of jericho and all his army was scattered from him then they took the king and carried him up unto the king of babylon to riblah in the land of hamath where he gave judgment upon him and the king of babylon slew the sons of zedekiah before his eyes he slew also all the princes of judah in riblah then he put out the eyes of zedekiah and the king of babylon bound him in chains and carried him to babylon and put him in prison till the day of his death now in the fifth month in the tenth day of the month which was the nineteenth year of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon came nebuzaradan captain of the guard which served the king of babylon into jerusalem and burned the house of the lord and the kings house and all the houses of jerusalem and all the houses of the great men burned he with fire and all the army of the chaldeans that were with the captain of the guard brake down all the walls of jerusalem round about then nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people and the residue of the people that remained in the city and those that fell away that fell to the king of babylon and the rest
