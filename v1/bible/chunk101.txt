said unto moses alas my lord i beseech thee lay not the sin upon us wherein we have done foolishly and wherein we have sinned let her not be as one dead of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mothers womb and moses cried unto the lord saying heal her now o god i beseech thee and the lord said unto moses if her father had but spit in her face should she not be ashamed seven days let her be shut out from the camp seven days and after that let her be received in again and miriam was shut out from the camp seven days and the people journeyed not till miriam was brought in again and afterward the people removed from hazeroth and pitched in the wilderness of paran and the lord spake unto moses saying send thou men that they may search the land of canaan which i give unto the children of israel of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man every one a ruler among them and moses by the commandment of the lord sent them from the wilderness of paran all those men were heads of the children of israel and these were their names of the tribe of reuben shammua the son of zaccur of the tribe of simeon shaphat the son of hori of the tribe of judah caleb the son of jephunneh of the tribe of issachar igal the son of joseph of the tribe of ephraim oshea the son of nun of the tribe of benjamin palti the son of raphu of the tribe of zebulun gaddiel the son of sodi of the tribe of joseph namely of the tribe of manasseh gaddi the son of susi of the tribe of dan ammiel the son of gemalli of the tribe of asher sethur the son of michael of the tribe of naphtali nahbi the son of vophsi of the tribe of gad geuel the son of machi these are the names of the men which moses sent to spy out the land and moses called oshea the son of nun jehoshua and moses sent them to spy out the land of canaan and said unto them get you up this way southward and go up into the mountain and see the land what it is and the people that dwelleth therein whether they be strong or weak few or many and what the land is that they dwell in whether it be good or bad and what cities they be that they dwell in whether in tents or in strong holds and what the land is whether it be fat or lean whether there be wood therein or not and be ye of good courage and bring of the fruit of the land now the time was the time of the firstripe grapes so they went up and searched the land from the wilderness of zin unto rehob as men come to hamath and they ascended by the south and came unto hebron where ahiman sheshai and talmai the children of anak were now hebron was built seven years before zoan in egypt and they came unto the brook of eshcol and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes and they bare it between two upon a staff and they brought of the pomegranates and of the figs the place was called the brook eshcol because of the cluster of grapes which the children of israel cut down from thence and they returned from searching of the land after forty days and they went and came to moses and to aaron and to all the congregation of the children of israel unto the wilderness of paran to kadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and shewed them the fruit of the land and they told him and said we came unto the land whither thou sentest us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walled and very great and moreover we saw the children of anak there the amalekites dwell in the land of the south and the hittites and the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and the canaanites dwell by the sea and by the coast of jordan and caleb stilled the people before moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature and there we saw the giants the sons of anak which come of the giants and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night and all the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron and the whole congregation said unto them would god that we had died in the land of egypt or would god we had died in this wilderness and wherefore hath the lord brought us unto this land to fall by the sword that our wives and our children should be a prey were it not better for us to return into egypt and they said one to another let us make a captain and let us return into egypt then moses and aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of israel and joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jephunneh which were of them that searched the land rent their clothes and they spake unto all the company of the children of israel saying the land which we passed through to search it is an exceeding good land if the lord delight in us then he will bring us into
