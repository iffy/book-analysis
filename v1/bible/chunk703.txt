consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all

to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus whereunto i also labour striving according to his working which worketh in me mightily for i would that ye knew what great conflict i have for you and for them at laodicea and for
