heavens shall vanish away like smoke and the earth shall wax old like a garment and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner but my salvation shall be for ever and my righteousness shall not be abolished hearken unto me ye that know righteousness the people in whose heart is my law fear ye not the reproach of men neither be ye afraid of their revilings for the moth shall eat them up like a garment and the worm shall eat them like wool but my righteousness shall be for ever and my salvation from generation to generation awake awake put on strength o arm of the lord awake as in the ancient days in the generations of old art thou not it that hath cut rahab and wounded the dragon art thou not it which hath dried the sea the waters of the great deep that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over therefore the redeemed of the lord shall return and come with singing unto zion and everlasting joy shall be upon their head they shall obtain gladness and joy and sorrow and mourning shall flee away i even i am he that comforteth you who art thou that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die and of the son of man which shall be made as grass and forgettest the lord thy maker that hath stretched forth the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor as if he were ready to destroy and where is the fury of the oppressor the captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed and that he should not die in the pit nor that his bread should fail but i am the lord thy god that divided the sea whose waves roared the lord of hosts is his name and i have put my words in thy mouth and i have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand that i may plant the heavens and lay the foundations of the earth and say unto zion thou art my people awake awake stand up o jerusalem which hast drunk at the hand of the lord the cup of his fury thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling and wrung them out there is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought up these two things are come unto thee who shall be sorry for thee desolation and destruction and the famine and the sword by whom shall i comfort thee thy sons have fainted they lie at the head of all the streets as a wild bull in a net they are full of the fury of the lord the rebuke of thy god therefore hear now this thou afflicted and drunken but not with wine thus saith thy lord the lord and thy god that pleadeth the cause of his people behold i have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling even the dregs of the cup of my fury thou shalt no more drink it again but i will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee which have said to thy soul bow down that we may go over and thou hast laid thy body as the ground and as the street to them that went over awake awake put on thy strength o zion put on thy beautiful garments o jerusalem the holy city for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean shake thyself from the dust arise and sit down o jerusalem loose thyself from the bands of thy neck o captive daughter of zion for thus saith the lord ye have sold yourselves for nought and ye shall be redeemed without money for thus saith the lord god my people went down aforetime into egypt to sojourn there and the assyrian oppressed them without cause now therefore what have i here saith the lord that my people is taken away for nought they that rule over them make them to howl saith the lord and my name continually every day is blasphemed therefore my people shall know my name therefore they shall know in that day that i am he that doth speak behold it is i how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings that publisheth peace that bringeth good tidings of good that publisheth salvation that saith unto zion thy god reigneth thy watchmen shall lift up the voice with the voice together shall they sing for they shall see eye to eye when the lord shall bring again zion break forth into joy sing together ye waste places of jerusalem for the lord hath comforted his people he hath redeemed jerusalem the lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our god depart ye depart ye go ye out from thence touch no unclean thing go ye out of the midst of her be ye clean that bear the vessels of the lord for ye shall not go out with haste nor go by flight for the lord will go before you and the god of israel will be your rereward behold my servant shall deal prudently he shall be exalted and extolled and be very high as many were astonied at thee his visage was so marred more than any man and his form more than the sons of men so shall he sprinkle many nations the kings shall shut their mouths at him for that which had not been told them shall they see and that which they had not heard shall they consider who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows
