the city which is next unto the slain man even the elders of that city shall take an heifer which hath not been wrought with and which hath not drawn in the yoke and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley which is neither eared nor sown and shall strike off the heifers neck there in the valley and the priests the sons of levi shall come near for them the lord thy god hath chosen to minister unto him and to bless in the name of the lord and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried and all the elders of that city that are next unto the slain man shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley and they shall answer and say our hands have not shed this blood neither have our eyes seen it be merciful o lord unto thy people israel whom thou hast redeemed and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of israels charge and the blood shall be forgiven them so shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the lord when thou goest forth to war against thine enemies and the lord thy god hath delivered them into thine hands and thou hast taken them captive and seest among the captives a beautiful woman and hast a desire unto her that thou wouldest have her to thy wife then thou shalt bring her home to thine house and she shall shave her head and pare her nails and she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her and shall remain in thine house and bewail her father and her mother a full month and after that thou shalt go in unto her and be her husband and she shall be thy wife and it shall be if thou have no delight in her then thou shalt let her go whither she will but thou shalt not sell her at all for money thou shalt not make merchandise of her because thou hast humbled her if a man have two wives one beloved and another hated and they have born him children both the beloved and the hated and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated then it shall be when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated which is indeed the firstborn but he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn by giving him a double portion of all that he hath for he is the beginning of his strength the right of the firstborn is his if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son which will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother and that when they have chastened him will not hearken unto them then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him and bring him out unto the elders of his city and unto the gate of his place and they shall say unto the elders of his city this our son is stubborn and rebellious he will not obey our voice he is a glutton and a drunkard and all the men of his city shall stone him with stones that he die so shalt thou put evil away from among you and all israel shall hear and fear and if a man have committed a sin worthy of death and he be to be put to death and thou hang him on a tree his body shall not remain all night upon the tree but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day for he that is hanged is accursed of god that thy land be not defiled which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance thou shalt not see thy brothers ox or his sheep go astray and hide thyself from them thou shalt in any case bring them again unto thy brother and if thy brother be not nigh unto thee or if thou know him not then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house and it shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it and thou shalt restore it to him again in like manner shalt thou do with his ass and so shalt thou do with his raiment and with all lost thing of thy brothers which he hath lost and thou hast found shalt thou do likewise thou mayest not hide thyself thou shalt not see thy brothers ass or his ox fall down by the way and hide thyself from them thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man neither shall a man put on a womans garment for all that do so are abomination unto the lord thy god if a birds nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree or on the ground whether they be young ones or eggs and the dam sitting upon the young or upon the eggs thou shalt not take the dam with the young but thou shalt in any wise let the dam go and take the young to thee that it may be well with thee and that thou mayest prolong thy days when thou buildest a new house then thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof that thou bring not blood upon thine house if any man fall from thence thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds lest the fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown and the fruit of thy vineyard be defiled thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts as of woollen and linen together thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy vesture wherewith thou coverest thyself if any man take a wife and go in unto her and hate her and give occasions of speech against her and bring up an evil name upon her and say i took this woman and when i came to her i found her not a maid
