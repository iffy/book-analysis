commended of you for in nothing am i behind the very chiefest apostles though i be nothing truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience in signs and wonders and mighty deeds for what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches except it be that i myself was not burdensome to you forgive me this wrong behold the third time i am ready to come to you and i will not be burdensome to you for i seek not yours but you for the children ought not to lay up for the parents but the parents for the children and i will very gladly spend and be spent for you though the more abundantly i love you the less i be loved but be it so i did not burden you nevertheless being crafty i caught you with guile did i make a gain of you by any of them whom i sent unto you i desired titus and with him i sent a brother did titus make a gain of you walked we not in the same spirit walked we not in the same steps again think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you we speak before god in christ but we do all things dearly beloved for your edifying for i fear lest when i come i shall not find you such as i would and that i shall be found unto you such as ye would not lest there be debates envyings wraths strifes backbitings whisperings swellings tumults and lest when i come again my god will humble me among you and that i shall bewail many which have sinned already and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed this is the third time i am coming to you in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established i told you before and foretell you as if i were present the second time and being absent now i write to them which heretofore have sinned and to all other that if i come again i will not spare since ye seek a proof of christ speaking in me which to you-ward is not weak but is mighty in you for though he was crucified through weakness yet he liveth by the power of god for we also are weak in him but we shall live with him by the power of god toward you examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith prove your own selves know ye not your own selves how that jesus christ is in you except ye be reprobates but i trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates now i pray to god that ye do no evil not that we should appear approved but that ye should do that which is honest though we be as reprobates for we can do nothing against the truth but for the truth for we are glad when we are weak and ye are strong and this also we wish even your perfection therefore i write these things being absent lest being present i should use sharpness according to the power which the lord hath given me to edification and not to destruction finally brethren farewell be perfect be of good comfort be of one mind live in peace and the god of love and peace shall be with you greet one another with an holy kiss all the saints salute you the grace of the lord jesus christ and the love of god and the communion of the holy ghost be with you all amen the epistle of paul the apostle to the galatians paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by jesus christ and god the father who raised him from the dead and all the brethren which are with me unto the churches of galatia grace be to you and peace from god the father and from our lord jesus christ who gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this present evil world according to the will of god and our father to whom be glory for ever and ever amen i marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of christ unto another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of christ but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed as we said before so say i now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received let him be accursed for do i now persuade men or god or do i seek to please men for if i yet pleased men i should not be the servant of christ but i certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man for i neither received it of man neither was i taught it but by the revelation of jesus christ for ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the jews religion how that beyond measure i persecuted the church of god and wasted it and profited in the jews religion above many my equals in mine own nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers but when it pleased god who separated me from my mothers womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me that i might preach him among the heathen immediately i conferred not with flesh and blood neither went i up to jerusalem to them which were apostles before me but i went into arabia and returned again unto damascus then after three years i went up to jerusalem to see peter and abode with him fifteen days but other of the apostles saw i none save james the lords brother now the things which i write unto you behold before god i lie not afterwards i came into the regions of syria and cilicia and was unknown by face unto the churches of judaea which were in christ but they had heard only that he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed and
