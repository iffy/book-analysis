are all of them vanity and their delectable things shall not profit and they are their own witnesses they see not nor know that they may be ashamed who hath formed a god or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing behold all his fellows shall be ashamed and the workmen they are of men let them all be gathered together let them stand up yet they shall fear and they shall be ashamed together the smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals and fashioneth it with hammers and worketh it with the strength of his arms yea he is hungry and his strength faileth he drinketh no water and is faint the carpenter stretcheth out his rule he marketh it out with a line he fitteth it with planes and he marketh it out with the compass and maketh it after the figure of a man according to the beauty of a man that it may remain in the house he heweth him down cedars and taketh the cypress and the oak which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest he planteth an ash and the rain doth nourish it then shall it be for a man to burn for he will take thereof and warm himself yea he kindleth it and baketh bread yea he maketh a god and worshippeth it he maketh it a graven image and falleth down thereto he burneth part thereof in the fire with part thereof he eateth flesh he roasteth roast and is satisfied yea he warmeth himself and saith aha i am warm i have seen the fire and the residue thereof he maketh a god even his graven image he falleth down unto it and worshippeth it and prayeth unto it and saith deliver me for thou art my god they have not known nor understood for he hath shut their eyes that they cannot see and their hearts that they cannot understand and none considereth in his heart neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say i have burned part of it in the fire yea also i have baked bread upon the coals thereof i have roasted flesh and eaten it and shall i make the residue thereof an abomination shall i fall down to the stock of a tree he feedeth on ashes a deceived heart hath turned him aside that he cannot deliver his soul nor say is there not a lie in my right hand remember these o jacob and israel for thou art my servant i have formed thee thou art my servant o israel thou shalt not be forgotten of me i have blotted out as a thick cloud thy transgressions and as a cloud thy sins return unto me for i have redeemed thee sing o ye heavens for the lord hath done it shout ye lower parts of the earth break forth into singing ye mountains o forest and every tree therein for the lord hath redeemed jacob and glorified himself in israel thus saith the lord thy redeemer and he that formed thee from the womb i am the lord that maketh all things that stretcheth forth the heavens alone that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself that frustrateth the tokens of the liars and maketh diviners mad that turneth wise men backward and maketh their knowledge foolish that confirmeth the word of his servant and performeth the counsel of his messengers that saith to jerusalem thou shalt be inhabited and to the cities of judah ye shall be built and i will raise up the decayed places thereof that saith to the deep be dry and i will dry up thy rivers that saith of cyrus he is my shepherd and shall perform all my pleasure even saying to jerusalem thou shalt be built and to the temple thy foundation shall be laid thus saith the lord to his anointed to cyrus whose right hand i have holden to subdue nations before him and i will loose the loins of kings to open before him the two leaved gates and the gates shall not be shut i will go before thee and make the crooked places straight i will break in pieces the gates of brass and cut in sunder the bars of iron and i will give thee the treasures of darkness and hidden riches of secret places that thou mayest know that i the lord which call thee by thy name am the god of israel for jacob my servants sake and israel mine elect i have even called thee by thy name i have surnamed thee though thou hast not known me i am the lord and there is none else there is no god beside me i girded thee though thou hast not known me that they may know from the rising of the

of my hands command ye me i have made the earth and created man upon it i even my hands have stretched out the heavens and all their host have i commanded i have raised him up in righteousness and i will direct all his ways he shall build my city and he shall let go my captives not for price nor reward saith the lord of hosts thus saith the lord the labour of egypt and merchandise of ethiopia and of the sabeans men of stature shall come over unto thee and they shall
