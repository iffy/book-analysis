transgression and because of their iniquities are afflicted their soul abhorreth all manner of meat and they draw near unto the gates of death then they cry unto the lord in their trouble and he saveth them out of their distresses he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men and let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving and declare his works with rejoicing they that go down to the sea in ships that do business in great waters these see the works of the lord and his wonders in the deep for he commandeth and raiseth the stormy wind which lifteth up the waves thereof they mount up to the heaven they go down again to the depths their soul is melted because of trouble they reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man and are at their wits end then they cry unto the lord in their trouble and he bringeth them out of their distresses he maketh the storm a calm so that the waves thereof are still then are they glad because they be quiet so he bringeth them unto their desired haven oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people and praise him in the assembly of the elders he turneth rivers into a wilderness and the watersprings into dry ground a fruitful land into barrenness for the wickedness of them that dwell therein he turneth the wilderness into a standing water and dry ground into watersprings and there he maketh the hungry to dwell that they may prepare a city for habitation and sow the fields and plant vineyards which may yield fruits of increase he blesseth them also so that they are multiplied greatly and suffereth not their cattle to decrease again they are minished and brought low through oppression affliction and sorrow he poureth contempt upon princes and causeth them to wander in the wilderness where there is no way yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction and maketh him families like a flock the righteous shall see it and rejoice and all iniquity shall stop her mouth whoso is wise and will observe these things even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the lord o god my heart is fixed i will sing and give praise even with my glory awake psaltery and harp i myself will awake early i will praise thee o lord among the people and i will sing praises unto thee among the nations for thy mercy is great above the heavens and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds be thou exalted o god above the heavens and thy glory above all the earth that thy beloved may be delivered save with thy right hand and answer me god hath spoken in his holiness i will rejoice i will divide shechem and mete out the valley of succoth gilead is mine manasseh is mine ephraim also is the strength of mine head judah is my lawgiver moab is my washpot over edom will i cast out my shoe over philistia will i triumph who will bring me into the strong city who will lead me into edom wilt not thou o god who hast cast us off and wilt not thou o god go forth with our hosts give us help from trouble for vain is the help of man through god we shall do valiantly for he it is that shall tread down our enemies hold not thy peace o god of my praise for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me they have spoken against me with a lying tongue they compassed me about also with words of hatred and fought against me without a cause for my love they are my adversaries but i give myself unto prayer and they have rewarded me evil for good and hatred for my love set thou a wicked man over him and let satan stand at his right hand when he shall be judged let him be condemned and let his prayer become sin let his days be few and let another take his office let his children be fatherless and his wife a widow let his children be continually vagabonds and beg let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places let the extortioner catch all that he hath and let the strangers spoil his labour let there be none to extend mercy unto him neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children let his posterity be cut off and in the generation following let their name be blotted out let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the lord and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out let them be before the lord continually that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth because that he remembered not to shew mercy but persecuted the poor and needy man that he might even slay the broken in heart as he loved cursing so let it come unto him as he delighted not in blessing so let it be far from him as he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment so let it come into his bowels like water and like oil into his bones let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the lord and of them that speak evil against my soul but do thou for me o god the lord for thy names sake because thy mercy is good deliver thou me for i am poor and needy and my heart is wounded within me i am gone like the shadow when it declineth i am tossed up and down as the locust my knees are weak through fasting and my flesh faileth of fatness i became also a reproach unto them when they looked upon me they shaked their heads help me o lord my god o save me according to thy mercy that they may know
