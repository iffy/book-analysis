waters beneath the earth thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them nor serve them for i the lord thy god am a jealous god visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain keep the sabbath day to sanctify it as the lord thy god hath commanded thee six days thou shalt labour and do all thy work but the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter nor thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor thine ox nor thine ass nor any of thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou and remember that thou wast a servant in the land of egypt and that the lord thy god brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm therefore the lord thy god commanded thee to keep the sabbath day honour thy father and thy mother as the lord thy god hath commanded thee that thy days may be prolonged and that it may go well with thee in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee thou shalt not kill neither shalt thou commit adultery neither shalt thou steal neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour neither shalt thou desire thy neighbours wife neither shalt thou covet thy neighbours house his field or his manservant or his maidservant his ox or his ass or any thing that is thy neighbours these words the lord spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire of the cloud and of the thick darkness with a great voice and he added no more and he wrote them in two tables of stone and delivered them unto me and it came to pass when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness for the mountain did burn with fire that ye came near unto me even all the heads of your tribes and your elders and ye said behold the lord our god hath shewed us his glory and his greatness and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire we have seen this day that god doth talk with man and he liveth now therefore why should we die for this great fire will consume us if we hear the voice of the lord our god any more then we shall die for who is there of all flesh that hath heard the voice of the living god speaking out of the midst of the fire as we have and lived go thou near and hear all that the lord our god shall say and speak thou unto us all that the lord our god shall speak unto thee and we will hear it and do it and the lord heard the voice of your words when ye spake unto me and the lord said unto me i have heard the voice of the words of this people which they have spoken unto thee they have well said all that they have spoken o that there were such an heart in them that they would fear me and keep all my commandments always that it might be well with them and with their children for ever go say to them get you into your tents again but as for thee stand thou here by me and i will speak unto thee all the commandments and the statutes and the judgments which thou shalt teach them that they may do them in the land which i give them to possess it ye shall observe to do therefore as the lord your god hath commanded you ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left ye shall walk in all the ways which the lord your god hath commanded you that ye may live and that it may be well with you and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess now these are the commandments the statutes and the judgments which the lord your god commanded to teach you that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it that thou mightest fear the lord thy god to keep all his statutes and his commandments which i command thee thou and thy son and thy sons son all the days of thy life and that thy days may be prolonged hear therefore o israel and observe to do it that it may be well with thee and that ye may increase mightily as the lord god of thy fathers hath promised thee in the land that floweth with milk and honey hear o israel the lord our god is one lord and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might and these words which i command thee this day shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes and thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house and on thy gates and it shall be when the lord thy god shall have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers to abraham to isaac and to jacob to give thee great and goodly cities which thou buildedst not and houses full of all good things which thou filledst not and wells digged which thou diggedst not vineyards and olive trees which thou plantedst not when thou shalt have eaten and be full then beware lest thou forget the lord which brought thee forth out of the land of egypt from the house
