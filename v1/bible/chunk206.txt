with me to battle thou and thy men and david said to achish surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do and achish said to david therefore will i make thee keeper of mine head for ever now samuel was dead and all israel had lamented him and buried him in ramah even in his own city and saul had put away those that had familiar spirits and the wizards out of the land and the philistines gathered themselves together and came and pitched in shunem and saul gathered all israel together and they pitched in gilboa and when saul saw the host of the philistines he was afraid and his heart greatly trembled and when saul enquired of the lord the lord answered him not neither by dreams nor by urim nor by prophets then said saul unto his servants seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit that i may go to her and enquire of her and his servants said to him behold there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at endor and saul disguised himself and put on other raiment and he went and two men with him and they came to the woman by night and he said i pray thee divine unto me by the familiar spirit and bring me him up whom i shall name unto thee and the woman said unto him behold thou knowest what saul hath done how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits and the wizards out of the land wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life to cause me to die and saul sware to her by the lord saying as the lord liveth there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing then said the woman whom shall i bring up unto thee and he said bring me up samuel and when the woman saw samuel she cried with a loud voice and the woman spake to saul saying why hast thou deceived me for thou art saul and the king said unto her be not afraid for what sawest thou and the woman said unto saul i saw gods ascending out of the earth and he said unto her what form is he of and she said an old man cometh up and he is covered with a mantle and saul perceived that it was samuel and he stooped with his face to the ground and bowed himself and samuel said to saul why hast thou disquieted me to bring me up and saul answered i am sore distressed for the philistines make war against me and god is departed from me and answereth me no more neither by prophets nor by dreams therefore i have called thee that thou mayest make known unto me what i shall do then said samuel wherefore then dost thou ask of me seeing the lord is departed from thee and is become thine enemy and the lord hath done to him as he spake by me for the lord hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand and given it to thy neighbour even to david because thou obeyedst not the voice of the lord nor executedst his fierce wrath upon amalek therefore hath the lord done this thing unto thee this day moreover the lord will also deliver israel with thee into the hand of the philistines and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me the lord also shall deliver the host of israel into the hand of the philistines then saul fell straightway all along on the earth and was sore afraid because of the words of samuel and there was no strength in him for he had eaten no bread all the day nor all the night and the woman came unto saul and saw that he was sore troubled and said unto him behold thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice and i have put my life in my hand and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me now therefore i pray thee hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid and let me set a morsel of bread before thee and eat that thou mayest have strength when thou goest on thy way but he refused and said i will not eat but his servants together with the woman compelled him and he hearkened unto their voice so he arose from the earth and sat upon the bed and the woman had a fat calf in the house and she hasted and killed it and took flour and kneaded it and did bake unleavened bread thereof and she brought it before saul and before his servants and they did eat then they rose up and went away that night now the philistines gathered together all their armies to aphek and the israelites pitched by a fountain which is in jezreel and the lords of the philistines passed on by hundreds and by thousands but david and his men passed on in the rereward with achish then said the princes of the philistines what do these hebrews here and achish said unto the princes of the philistines is not this david the servant of saul the king of israel which hath been with me these days or these years and i have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto this day and the princes of the philistines were wroth with him and the princes of the philistines said unto him make this fellow return that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him and let him not go down with us to battle lest in the battle he be an adversary to us for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master should it not be with the heads of these men is not this david of whom they sang one to another in dances saying saul slew his thousands and david his ten thousands then achish called david and said unto him surely as the lord liveth thou hast been upright and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight for i have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day nevertheless the lords favour thee not wherefore now return and
