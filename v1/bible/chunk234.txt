stood upon twelve oxen three looking toward the north and three looking toward the west and three looking toward the south and three looking toward the east and the sea was set above upon them and all their hinder parts were inward and it was an hand breadth thick and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup with flowers of lilies it contained two thousand baths and he made ten bases of brass four cubits was the length of one base and four cubits the breadth thereof and three cubits the height of it and the work of the bases was on this manner they had borders and the borders were between the ledges and on the borders that were between the ledges were lions oxen and cherubims and upon the ledges there was a base above and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work and every base had four brasen wheels and plates of brass and the four corners thereof had undersetters under the laver were undersetters molten at the side of every addition and the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base a cubit and an half and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders foursquare not round and under the borders were four wheels and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit and the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel their axletrees and their naves and their felloes and their spokes were all molten and there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base and the undersetters were of the very base itself and in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same for on the plates of the ledges thereof and on the borders thereof he graved cherubims lions and palm trees according to the proportion of every one and additions round about after this manner he

were on the top of the two pillars and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars and four hundred pomegranates for the two networks even two rows of pomegranates for one network to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars and the ten bases and ten lavers on the bases and one sea and twelve oxen under the sea and the pots and the shovels and the basons and all these vessels which hiram made to king solomon for the house of the lord were of bright brass in the plain of jordan did the king cast them in the clay ground between succoth and zarthan and solomon left all the vessels unweighed because they were exceeding many neither was the weight of the brass found out and solomon made all the vessels that pertained
