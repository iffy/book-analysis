which shall not be destroyed i daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body and the visions of my head troubled me i came near unto one of them that stood by and asked him the truth of all this so he told me and made me know the interpretation of the things these great beasts which are four are four kings which shall arise out of the earth but the saints of the most high shall take the kingdom and possess the kingdom for ever even for ever and ever then i would know the truth of the fourth beast which was diverse from all the others exceeding dreadful whose teeth were of iron and his nails of brass which devoured brake in pieces and stamped the residue with his feet and of the ten horns that were in his head and of the other which came up and before whom three fell even of that horn that had eyes and a mouth that spake very great things whose look was more stout than his fellows i beheld and the same horn made war with the saints and prevailed against them until the ancient of days came and judgment was given to the saints of the most high and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom thus he said the fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth which shall be diverse from all kingdoms and shall devour the whole earth and shall tread it down and break it in pieces and the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise and another shall rise after them and he shall be diverse from the first and he shall subdue three kings and he shall speak great words against the most high and shall wear out the saints of the most high and think to change times and laws and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time but the judgment shall sit and they shall take away his dominion to consume and to destroy it unto the end and the kingdom and dominion and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the most high whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and all dominions shall serve and obey him hitherto is the end of the matter as for me daniel my cogitations much troubled me and my countenance changed in me but i kept the matter in my heart in the third year of the reign of king belshazzar a vision appeared unto me even unto me daniel after that which appeared unto me at the first and i saw in a vision and it came to pass when i saw that i was at shushan in the palace which is in the province of elam and i saw in a vision and i was by the river of ulai then i lifted up mine eyes and saw and behold there stood before the river a ram which had two horns and the two horns were high but one was higher than the other and the higher came up last i saw the ram pushing westward and northward and southward so that no beasts might stand before him neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand but he did according to his will and became great and as i was considering behold an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth and touched not the ground and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes and he came to the ram that had two horns which i had seen standing before the river and ran unto him in the fury of his power and i saw him come close unto the ram and he was moved with choler against him and smote the ram and brake his two horns and there was no power in the ram to stand before him but he cast him down to the ground and stamped upon him and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand therefore the he goat waxed very great and when he was strong the great horn was broken and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven and out of one of them came forth a little horn which waxed exceeding great toward the south and toward the east and toward the pleasant land and it waxed great even to the host of heaven and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground and stamped upon them yea he magnified himself even to the prince of the host and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away and the place of the sanctuary was cast down and an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression and it cast down the truth to the ground and it practised and prospered then i heard one saint speaking and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake how long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice and the transgression of desolation to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot and he said unto me unto two thousand and three hundred days then shall the sanctuary be cleansed and it came to pass when i even i daniel had seen the vision and sought for the meaning then behold there stood before me as the appearance of a man and i heard a mans voice between the banks of ulai which called and said gabriel make this man to understand the vision so he came near where i stood and when he came i was afraid and fell upon my face but he said unto me understand o son of man for at the time of the end shall be the vision now as he was speaking with me i was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground but he touched me and set me upright and he said behold i will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation for at the time appointed the end shall be the ram which thou sawest having
