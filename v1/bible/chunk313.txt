the ordinances by the hand of moses so manasseh made judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem to err and to do worse than the heathen whom the lord had destroyed before the children of israel and the lord spake to manasseh and to his people but they would not hearken wherefore the lord brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of assyria which took manasseh among the thorns and bound him with fetters and carried him to babylon and when he was in affliction he besought the lord his god and humbled himself greatly before the god of his fathers and prayed unto him and he was intreated of him and heard his supplication and brought him again to jerusalem into his kingdom then manasseh knew that the lord he was god now after this he built a wall without the city of david on the west side of gihon in the valley even to the entering in at the fish gate and compassed about ophel and raised it up a very great height and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of judah and he took away the strange gods and the idol out of the house of the lord and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the lord and in jerusalem and cast them out of the city and he repaired the altar of the lord and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings and commanded judah to serve the lord god of israel nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places yet unto the lord their god only now the rest of the acts of manasseh and his prayer unto his god and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the lord god of israel behold they are written in the book of the kings of israel his prayer also and how god was intreated of him and all his sins and his trespass and the places wherein he built high places and set up groves and graven images before he was humbled behold they are written among the sayings of the seers so manasseh slept with his fathers and they buried him in his own house and amon his son reigned in his stead amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign and reigned two years in jerusalem but he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord as did manasseh his father for amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which manasseh his father had made and served them and humbled not himself before the lord as manasseh his father had humbled himself but amon trespassed more and more and his servants conspired against him and slew him in his own house but the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king amon and the people of the land made josiah his son king in his stead josiah was eight years old when he began to reign and he reigned in jerusalem one and thirty years and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord and walked in the ways of david his father and declined neither to the right hand nor to the left for in the eighth year of his reign while he was yet young he began to seek after the god of david his father and in the twelfth year he began to purge judah and jerusalem from the high places and the groves and the carved images and the molten images and they brake down the altars of baalim in his presence and the images that were on high above them he cut down and the groves and the carved images and the molten images he brake in pieces and made dust of them and strowed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them and he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars and cleansed judah and jerusalem and so did he in the cities of manasseh and ephraim and simeon even unto naphtali with their mattocks round about and when he had broken down the altars and the groves and had beaten the graven images into powder and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of israel he returned to jerusalem now in the eighteenth year of his reign when he had purged the land and the house he sent shaphan the son of azaliah and maaseiah the governor of the city and joah the son of joahaz the recorder to repair the house of the lord his god and when they came to hilkiah the high priest they delivered the money that was brought into the house of god which the levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of manasseh and ephraim and of all the remnant of israel and of all judah and benjamin and they returned to jerusalem and they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the lord and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the lord to repair and amend the house even to the artificers and builders gave they it to buy hewn stone and timber for couplings and to floor the houses which the kings of judah had destroyed and the men did the work faithfully and the overseers of them were jahath and obadiah the levites of the sons of merari and zechariah and meshullam of the sons of the kohathites to set it forward and other of the levites all that could skill of instruments of musick also they were over the bearers of burdens and were overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service and of the levites there were scribes and officers and porters and when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the lord hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the lord given by moses and hilkiah answered and said to shaphan the scribe i have found the book of the law in the house of the lord and hilkiah delivered the book to shaphan and shaphan carried the book to the king and brought the king word back again
