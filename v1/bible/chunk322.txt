god hath not forsaken us in our bondage but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of persia to give us a reviving to set up the house of our god and to repair the desolations thereof and to give us a wall in judah and in jerusalem and now o our god what shall we say after this for we have forsaken thy commandments which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets saying the land unto which ye go to possess it is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands with their abominations which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons neither take their daughters unto your sons nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever that ye may be strong and eat the good of the land and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever and after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great trespass seeing that thou our god hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve and hast given us such deliverance as this should we again break thy commandments and join in affinity with the people of these abominations wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us so that there should be no remnant nor escaping o lord god of israel thou art righteous for we remain yet escaped as it is this day behold we are before thee in our trespasses for we cannot stand before thee because of this now when ezra had prayed and when he had confessed weeping and casting himself down before the house of god there assembled unto him out of israel a very great congregation of men and women and children for the people wept very sore and shechaniah the son of jehiel one of the sons of elam answered and said unto ezra we have trespassed against our god and have taken strange wives of the people of the land yet now there is hope in israel concerning this thing now therefore let us make a covenant with our god to put away all the wives and such as are born of them according to the counsel of my lord and of those that tremble at the commandment of our god and let it be done according to the law arise for this matter belongeth unto thee we also will be with thee be of good courage and do it then arose ezra and made the chief priests the levites and all israel to swear that they should do according to this word and they sware then ezra rose up from before the house of god and went into the chamber of johanan the son of eliashib and when he came thither he did eat no bread nor drink water for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away and they made proclamation throughout judah and jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity that they should gather themselves together unto jerusalem and that whosoever would not come within three days according to the counsel of the princes and the elders all his substance should be forfeited and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away then all the men of judah and benjamin gathered themselves together unto jerusalem within three days it was the ninth month on the twentieth day of the month and all the people sat in the street of the house of god trembling because of this matter and for the great rain and ezra the priest stood up and said unto them ye have transgressed and have taken strange wives to increase the trespass of israel now therefore make confession unto the lord god of your fathers and do his pleasure and separate yourselves from the people of the land and from the strange wives then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice as thou hast said so must we do but the people are many and it is a time of much rain and we are not able to stand without neither is this a work of one day or two for we are many that have transgressed in this thing let now our rulers of all the congregation stand and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times and with them the elders of every city and the judges thereof until the fierce wrath of our god for this matter be turned from us only jonathan the son of asahel and jahaziah the son of tikvah were employed about this matter and meshullam and shabbethai the levite helped them and the children of the captivity did so and ezra the priest with certain chief of the fathers after the house of their fathers and all of them by their names were separated and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter and they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month and among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives namely of the sons of jeshua the son of jozadak and his brethren maaseiah and eliezer
