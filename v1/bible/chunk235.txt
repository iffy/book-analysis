seen out in the holy place before the oracle and they were not seen without and there they are unto this day there was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which moses put there at horeb when the lord made a covenant with the children of israel when they came out of the land of egypt and it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place that the cloud filled the house of the lord so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud for the glory of the lord had filled the house of the lord then spake solomon the lord said that he would dwell in the thick darkness i have surely built thee an house to dwell in a settled place for thee to abide in for ever and the king turned his face about and blessed all the congregation of israel and all the congregation of israel stood and he said blessed be the lord god of israel which spake with his mouth unto david my father and hath with his hand fulfilled it saying since the day that i brought forth my people israel out of egypt i chose no city out of all the tribes of israel to build an house that my name might be therein but i chose david to be over my people israel and it was in the heart of david my father to build an house for the name of the lord god of israel and the lord said unto david my father whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name thou didst well that it was in thine heart nevertheless thou shalt not build the house but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins he shall build the house unto my name and the lord hath performed his word that he spake and i am risen up in the room of david my father and sit on the throne of israel as the lord promised and have built an house for the name of the lord god of israel and i have set there a place for the ark wherein is the covenant of the lord which he made with our fathers when he brought them out of the land of egypt and solomon stood before the altar of the lord in the presence of all the congregation of israel and spread forth his hands toward heaven and he said lord god of israel there is no god like thee in heaven above or on earth beneath who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart who hast kept with thy servant david my father that thou promisedst him thou spakest also with thy mouth and hast fulfilled it with thine hand as it is this day therefore now lord god of israel keep with thy servant david my father that thou promisedst him saying there shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of israel so that thy children take heed to their way that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me and now o god of israel let thy word i pray thee be verified which thou spakest unto thy servant david my father but will god indeed dwell on the earth behold the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee how much less this house that i have builded yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant and to his supplication o lord my god to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee to day that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day even toward the place of which thou hast said my name shall be there that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place and hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant and of thy people israel when they shall pray toward this place and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place and when thou hearest forgive if any man trespass against his neighbour and an oath

and justifying the righteous to give him according to his righteousness when thy people israel be smitten down before the enemy because they have sinned against thee and shall turn again to thee and confess thy name and pray and make supplication unto thee in this house then hear thou in heaven and forgive the sin of thy people israel and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto

the children of men that they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers moreover concerning a stranger that is not of thy people israel but cometh out of a far country for thy names sake for they shall hear of thy great name and of thy strong
