better for me to die than to live and god said to jonah doest thou well to be angry for the gourd and he said i do well to be angry even unto death then said the lord thou hast had pity on the gourd for the which thou hast not laboured neither madest it grow which came up in a night and perished in a night and should not i spare nineveh that great city wherein are more then sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand and also much cattle micah the word of the lord that came to micah the morasthite in the days of jotham ahaz and hezekiah kings of judah which he saw concerning samaria and jerusalem hear all ye people hearken o earth and all that therein is and let the lord god be witness against you the lord from his holy temple for behold the lord cometh forth out of his place and will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth and the mountains shall be molten under him and the valleys shall be cleft as wax before the fire and as the waters that are poured down a steep place for the transgression of jacob is all this and for the sins of the house of israel what is the transgression of jacob is it not samaria and what are the high places of judah are they not jerusalem therefore i will make samaria as an heap of the field and as plantings of a vineyard and i will pour down the stones thereof into the valley and i will discover the foundations thereof and all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire and all the idols thereof will i lay desolate for she gathered it of the hire of an harlot and they shall return to the hire of an harlot therefore i will wail and howl i will go stripped and naked i will make a wailing like the dragons and mourning as the owls for her wound is incurable for it is come unto judah he is come unto the gate of my people even to jerusalem declare ye it not at gath weep ye not at all in the house of aphrah roll thyself in the dust pass ye away thou inhabitant of saphir having thy shame naked the inhabitant of zaanan came not forth in the mourning of bethezel he shall receive of you his standing for the inhabitant of maroth waited carefully for good but evil came down from the lord unto the gate of jerusalem o thou inhabitant of lachish bind the chariot to the swift beast she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of zion for the transgressions of israel were found in thee therefore shalt thou give presents to moreshethgath the houses of achzib shall be a lie to the kings of israel yet will i bring an heir unto thee o inhabitant of mareshah he shall come unto adullam the glory of israel make thee bald and poll thee for thy delicate children enlarge thy baldness as the eagle for they are gone into captivity from thee woe to them that devise iniquity and work evil upon their beds when the morning is light they practise it because it is in the power of their hand and they covet fields and take them by violence and houses and take them away so they oppress a man and his house even a man and his heritage therefore thus saith the lord behold against this family do i devise an evil from which ye shall not remove your necks neither shall ye go haughtily for this time is evil in that day shall one take up a parable against you and lament with a doleful lamentation and say we be utterly spoiled he hath changed the portion of my people how hath he removed it from me turning away he hath divided our fields therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the lord prophesy ye not say they to them that prophesy they shall not prophesy to them that they shall not take shame o thou that art named the house of jacob is the spirit of the lord straitened are these his doings do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly even of late my people is risen up as an enemy ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war the women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever arise ye and depart for this is not your rest because it is polluted it shall destroy you even with a sore destruction if a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie saying i will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink he shall even be the prophet of this people i will surely assemble o jacob all of thee i will surely gather the remnant of israel i will put them together as the sheep of bozrah as the flock in the midst of their fold they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men the breaker is come up before them they have broken up and have passed through the gate and are gone out by it and their king shall pass before them and the lord on the head of them and i said hear i pray you o heads of jacob and ye princes of the house of israel is it not for you to know judgment who hate the good and love the evil who pluck off their skin from off them and their flesh from off their bones who also eat the flesh of my people and flay their skin from off them and they break their bones and chop them in pieces as for the pot and as flesh within the caldron then shall they cry unto the lord but he will not hear them he will even hide his face from them at that time as they have behaved themselves ill in their
