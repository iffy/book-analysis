shall enter into the countries and shall overflow and pass over he shall enter also into the glorious land and many countries shall be overthrown but these shall escape out of his hand even edom and moab and the chief of the children of ammon he shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries and the land of egypt shall not escape but he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver and over all the precious things of egypt and the libyans and the ethiopians shall be at his steps but tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy and utterly to make away many and he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain yet he shall come to his end and none shall help him and at that time shall michael stand up the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever but thou o daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased then i daniel looked and behold there stood other two the one on this side of the bank of the river and the other on that side of the bank of the river and one said to the man clothed in linen which was upon the waters of the river how long shall it be to the end of these wonders and i heard the man clothed in linen which was upon the waters of the river when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time times and an half and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people all these things shall be finished and i heard but i understood not then said i o my lord what shall be the end of these things and he said go thy way daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end many shall be purified and made white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand and from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away and the abomination that maketh desolate set up there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days blessed is he that waiteth and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days but go thou thy way till the end be for thou shalt rest and stand in thy lot at the end of the days hosea the word of the lord that came unto hosea the son of beeri in the days of uzziah jotham ahaz and hezekiah kings of judah and in the days of jeroboam the son of joash king of israel the beginning of the word of the lord by hosea and the lord said to hosea go take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms for the land hath committed great whoredom departing from the lord so he went and took gomer the daughter of diblaim which conceived and bare him a son and the lord said unto him call his name jezreel for yet a little while and i will avenge the blood of jezreel upon the house of jehu and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of israel and it shall come to pass at that day that i will break the bow of israel in the valley of jezreel and she conceived again and bare a daughter and god said unto him call her name loruhamah for i will no more have mercy upon the house of israel but i will utterly take them away but i will have mercy upon the house of judah and will save them by the lord their god and will not save them by bow nor by sword nor by battle by horses nor by horsemen now when she had weaned loruhamah she conceived and bare a son then said god call his name loammi for ye are not my people and i will not be your god yet the number of the children of israel shall be as the sand of the sea which cannot be measured nor numbered and it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them ye are not my people there it shall be said unto them ye are the sons of the living god then shall the children of judah and the children of israel be gathered together and appoint themselves one head and they shall come up out of the land for great shall be the day of jezreel say ye unto your brethren ammi and to your sisters ruhamah plead with your mother plead for she is not my wife neither am i her husband let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight and her adulteries from between her breasts lest i strip her naked and set her as in the day that she was born and make her as a wilderness and set her like a dry land and slay her with thirst and i will not have mercy upon her children for they be the children of whoredoms for their mother hath played the harlot she that conceived them hath done shamefully for she said i will go after my lovers that give me my bread and my water my wool and my flax mine oil and my drink therefore behold i will hedge up thy way with thorns and
