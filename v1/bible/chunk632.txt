him and said unto him why baptizest thou then if thou be not that christ nor elias neither that prophet john answered them saying i baptize with water but there standeth one among you whom ye know not he it is who coming after me is preferred before me whose shoes latchet i am not worthy to unloose these things were done in bethabara beyond jordan where john was baptizing the next day john seeth jesus coming unto him and saith behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world this is he of whom i said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me and i knew him not but that he should be made manifest to israel therefore am i come baptizing with water and john bare record saying i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it abode upon him and i knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptizeth with the holy ghost and i saw and bare record that this is the son of god again the next day after john stood and two of his disciples and looking upon jesus as he walked he saith behold the lamb of god and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed jesus then jesus turned and saw them following and saith unto them what seek ye they said unto him rabbi which is to say being interpreted master where dwellest thou he saith unto them come and see they came and saw where he dwelt and abode with him that day for it was about the tenth hour one of the two which heard john speak and followed him was andrew simon peters brother he first findeth his own brother simon and saith unto him we have found the messias which is being interpreted the christ and he brought him to jesus and when jesus beheld him he said thou art simon the son of jona thou shalt be called cephas which is by interpretation a stone the day following jesus would go forth into galilee and findeth philip and saith unto him follow me now philip was of bethsaida the city of andrew and peter philip findeth nathanael and saith unto him we have found him of whom moses in the law and the prophets did write jesus of nazareth the son of joseph and nathanael said unto him can there any good thing come out of nazareth philip saith unto him come and see jesus saw nathanael coming to him and saith of him behold an israelite indeed in whom is no guile nathanael saith unto him whence knowest thou me jesus answered and said unto him before that philip called thee when thou wast under the fig tree i saw thee nathanael answered and saith unto him rabbi thou art the son of god thou art the king of israel jesus answered and said unto him because i said unto thee i saw thee under the fig tree believest thou thou shalt see greater things than these and he saith unto him verily verily i say unto you hereafter ye shall see heaven open and the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man and the third day there was a marriage in cana of galilee and the mother of jesus was there and both jesus was called and his disciples to the marriage and when they wanted wine the mother of jesus saith unto him they
