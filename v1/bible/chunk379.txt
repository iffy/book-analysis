horn shall be exalted for the lord is our defence and the holy one of israel is our king then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one and saidst i have laid help upon one that is mighty i have exalted one chosen out of the people i have found david my servant with my holy oil have i anointed him with whom my hand shall be established mine arm also shall strengthen him the enemy shall not exact upon him nor the son of wickedness afflict him and i will beat down his foes before his face and plague them that hate him but my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him and in my name shall his horn

all his hedges thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin all that pass by the way spoil him he is a reproach to his neighbours thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice thou hast also turned the edge of his sword and hast not made him to stand in the battle thou hast made his glory to cease and cast his throne down to the ground the days of his youth hast thou shortened thou hast covered him with shame selah how long lord wilt thou hide thyself for ever shall thy wrath burn like fire remember how short my time is wherefore hast thou made all men in vain what man is he that liveth and shall not see death shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave selah lord where are thy former lovingkindnesses which thou swarest unto david in

their strength labour and sorrow for it is soon cut off and we fly away who knoweth the power of thine anger even according to thy fear so is thy wrath so teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom return o lord how long and let it
