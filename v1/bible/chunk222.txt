called unto the porter and said behold another man running alone and the king said he also bringeth tidings and the watchman said me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of ahimaaz the son of zadok and the king said he is a good man and cometh with good tidings and ahimaaz called and said unto the king all is well and he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king and said blessed be the lord thy god which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king and the king said is the young man absalom safe and ahimaaz answered when joab sent the kings servant and me thy servant i saw a great tumult but i knew not what it was and the king said unto him turn aside and stand here and he turned aside and stood still and behold cushi came and cushi said tidings my lord the king for the lord hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee and the king said unto cushi is the young man absalom safe and cushi answered the enemies of my lord the king and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt be as that young man is and the king was much moved and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept and as he went thus he said o my son absalom my son my son absalom would god i had died for thee o absalom my son my son and it was told joab behold the king weepeth and mourneth for absalom and the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son and the people gat them by stealth that day into the city as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle but the king covered his face and the king cried with a loud voice o my son absalom o absalom my son my son and joab came into the house to the king and said thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants which this day have saved thy life and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters and the lives of thy wives and the lives of thy concubines in that thou lovest thine enemies and hatest thy friends for thou hast declared this day that thou regardest neither princes nor servants for this day i perceive that if absalom had lived and all we had died this day then it had pleased thee well now therefore arise go forth and speak comfortably unto thy servants for i swear by the lord if thou go not forth there will not tarry one with thee this night and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now then the king arose and sat in the gate and they told unto all the people saying behold the king doth sit in the gate and all the people came before the king for israel had fled every man to his tent and all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of israel saying the king saved us out of the hand of our enemies and he delivered us out of the hand of the philistines and now he is fled out of the land for absalom and absalom whom we anointed over us is dead in battle now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back and king david sent to zadok and to abiathar the priests saying speak unto the elders of judah saying why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house seeing the speech of all israel is come to the king even to his house ye are my brethren ye are my bones and my flesh wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king and say ye to amasa art thou not of my bone and of my flesh god do so to me and more also if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of joab and he bowed the heart of all the men of judah even as the heart of one man so that they sent this word unto the king return thou and all thy servants so the king returned and came to jordan and judah came to gilgal to go to meet the king to conduct the king over jordan and shimei the son of gera a benjamite which was of bahurim hasted and came down with the men of judah to meet king david and there were a thousand men of benjamin with him and ziba the servant of the house of saul and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him and they went over jordan before the king and there went over a ferry boat to carry over the kings household and to do what he thought good and shimei the son of gera fell down before the king as he was come over jordan and said unto the king let not my lord impute iniquity unto me neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of jerusalem that the king should take it to his heart for thy servant doth know that i have sinned therefore behold i am come the first this day of all the house of joseph to go down to meet my lord the king but abishai the son of zeruiah answered and said shall not shimei be put to death for this because he cursed the lords anointed and david said what have i to do with you ye sons of zeruiah that ye should this day be adversaries unto me shall there any man be put to death this day in israel for do not i know that i am this day king over israel therefore the king said unto shimei thou shalt not die and the king sware unto him and mephibosheth the son of saul came down to meet the king and had neither dressed his feet nor trimmed his beard nor washed
