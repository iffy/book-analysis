the king of assyria and i will defend this city for mine own sake and for my servant davids sake and isaiah said take a lump of figs and they took and laid it on the boil and he recovered and hezekiah said unto isaiah what shall be the sign that the lord will heal me and that i shall go up into the house of the lord the third day and isaiah said this sign shalt thou have of the lord that the lord will do the thing that he hath spoken shall the shadow go forward ten degrees or go back ten degrees and hezekiah answered it is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees nay but let the shadow return backward ten degrees and isaiah the prophet cried unto the lord and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward by which it had gone down in the dial of ahaz at that time berodachbaladan the son of baladan king of babylon sent letters and a present unto hezekiah for he had heard that hezekiah had been sick and hezekiah hearkened unto them and shewed them all the house of his precious things the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious ointment and all the house of his armour and all that was found in his treasures there was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that hezekiah shewed them not then came isaiah the prophet unto king hezekiah and said unto him what said these men and from whence came they unto thee and hezekiah said they are come from a far country even from babylon and he said what have they seen in thine house and hezekiah answered all the things that are in mine house have they seen there is nothing among my treasures that i have not shewed them and isaiah said unto hezekiah hear the word of the lord behold the days come that all that is in thine house and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day shall be carried into babylon nothing shall be left saith the lord and of thy sons that shall issue from thee which thou shalt beget shall they take away and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of babylon then said hezekiah unto isaiah good is the word of the lord which thou hast spoken and he said is it not good if peace and truth be in my days and the rest of the acts of hezekiah and all his might and how he made a pool and a conduit and brought water into the city are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah and hezekiah slept with his fathers and manasseh his son reigned in his stead manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign and reigned fifty and five years in jerusalem and his mothers name was hephzibah and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord after the abominations of the heathen whom the lord cast out before the children of israel for he built up again the high places which hezekiah his father had destroyed and he reared up altars for baal and made a grove as did ahab king of israel and worshipped all the host of heaven and served them and he built altars in the house of the lord of which the lord said in jerusalem will i put my name and he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the lord and he made his son pass through the fire and observed times and used enchantments and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger and he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house of which the lord said to david and to solomon his son in this house and in jerusalem which i have chosen out of all tribes of israel will i put my name for ever neither will i make the feet of israel move any more out of the land which i gave their fathers only if they will observe to do according to all that i have commanded them and according to all the law that my servant moses commanded them but they hearkened not and manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the lord destroyed before the children of israel and the lord spake by his servants the prophets saying because manasseh king of judah hath done these abominations and hath done wickedly above all that the amorites did which were before him and hath made judah also to sin with his idols therefore thus saith the lord god of israel behold i am bringing such evil upon jerusalem and judah that whosoever heareth of it both his ears shall tingle and i will stretch over jerusalem the line of samaria and the plummet of the house of ahab and i will wipe jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish wiping it and turning it upside down and i will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance and deliver them into the hand of their enemies and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies because they have done that which was evil in my sight and have provoked me to anger since the day their fathers came forth out of egypt even unto this day moreover manasseh shed innocent blood very much till he had filled jerusalem from one end to another beside his sin wherewith he made judah to sin in doing that which was evil in the sight of the lord now the rest of the acts of manasseh and all that he did and his sin that he sinned are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah and manasseh slept with his fathers and was buried in the garden of his own house in the garden of uzza and amon his son reigned in his stead amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign and he reigned two
