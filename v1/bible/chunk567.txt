kindled against the shepherds and i punished the goats for the lord of hosts hath visited his flock the house of judah and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle out of him came forth the corner out of him the nail out of him the battle bow out of him every oppressor together and they shall be as mighty men which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle and they shall fight because the lord is with them and the riders on horses shall be confounded and i will strengthen the house of judah and i will save the house of joseph and i will bring them again to place them for i have mercy upon them and they shall be as though i had not cast them off for i am the lord their god and will hear them and they of ephraim shall be like a mighty man and their heart shall rejoice as through wine yea their children shall see it and be glad their heart shall rejoice in the lord i will hiss for them and gather them for i have redeemed them and they shall increase as they have increased and i will sow them among the people and they shall remember me in far countries and they shall live with their children and turn again i will bring them again also out of the land of egypt and gather them out of assyria and i will bring them into the land of gilead and lebanon and place shall not be found for them and he shall pass through the sea with affliction and shall smite the waves in the sea and all the deeps of the river shall dry up and the pride of assyria shall be brought down and the sceptre of egypt shall depart away and i will strengthen them in the lord and they shall walk up and down in his name saith the lord open thy doors o lebanon that the fire may devour thy cedars howl fir tree for the cedar is fallen because the mighty are spoiled howl o ye oaks of bashan for the forest of the vintage is come down there is a voice of the howling of the shepherds for their glory is spoiled a voice of the roaring of young lions for the pride of jordan is spoiled thus saith the lord my god feed the flock of the slaughter whose possessors slay them and hold themselves not guilty and they that sell them say blessed be the lord for i am rich and their own shepherds pity them not for i will no more pity the inhabitants of the land saith the lord but lo i will deliver the men every one into his neighbours hand and into the hand of his king and they shall smite the land and out of their hand i will not deliver them and i will feed the flock of slaughter even you o poor of the flock and i took unto me two staves the one i called beauty and the other i called bands and i fed the flock three shepherds also i cut off in one month and my soul lothed them and their soul also abhorred me then said i i will not feed you that that dieth let it die and that that is to be cut off let it be cut off and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another and i took my staff even beauty and cut it asunder that i might break my covenant which i had made with all the people and it was broken in that day and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the lord and i said unto them if ye think good give me my price and if not forbear so they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver and the lord said unto me cast it unto the potter a goodly price that i was prised at of them and i took the thirty pieces of silver and cast them to the potter in the house of the lord then i cut asunder mine other staff even bands that i might break the brotherhood between judah and israel and the lord said unto me take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd for lo i will raise up a shepherd in the land which shall not visit those that be cut off neither shall seek the young one nor heal that that is broken nor feed that that standeth still but he shall eat the flesh of the fat and tear their claws in pieces woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock the sword shall be upon his arm and upon his right eye his arm shall be clean dried up and his right eye shall be utterly darkened the burden of the word of the lord for israel saith the lord which stretcheth forth the heavens and layeth the foundation of the earth and formeth the spirit of man within him behold i will make jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about when they shall be in the siege both against judah and against jerusalem

and the governors of judah shall say in their heart the inhabitants of jerusalem shall be my strength in the lord of hosts their god in that day will i make the governors of judah like an hearth of fire among the wood and like a torch of fire in a sheaf and they shall devour all the people round about on the right hand and on the left and jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place even in jerusalem the lord also shall save the tents of judah first that the glory
