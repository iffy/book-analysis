and did hastily catch it and they said thy brother benhadad then he said go ye bring him then benhadad came forth to him and he caused him to come up into the chariot and ben-hadad said unto him the cities which my father took from thy father i will restore and thou shalt make streets for thee in damascus as my father made in samaria then said ahab i will send thee away with this covenant so he made a covenant with him and sent him away and a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the lord smite me i pray thee and the man refused to smite him then said he unto him because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the lord behold as soon as thou art departed from me a lion shall slay thee and as soon as he was departed from him a lion found him and slew him then he found another man and said smite me i pray thee and the man smote him so that in smiting he wounded him so the prophet departed and waited for the king by the way and disguised himself with ashes upon his face and as the king passed by he cried unto the king and he said thy servant went out into the midst of the battle and behold a man turned aside and brought a man unto me and said keep this man if by any means he be missing then shall thy life be for his life or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver and as thy servant was busy here and there he was gone and the king of israel said unto him so shall thy judgment be thyself hast decided it and he hasted and took the ashes away from his face and the king of israel discerned him that he was of the prophets and he said unto him thus saith the lord because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom i appointed to utter destruction therefore thy life shall go for his life and thy people for his people and the king of israel went to his house heavy and displeased and came to samaria and it came to pass after these things that naboth the jezreelite had a vineyard which was in jezreel hard by the palace of ahab king of samaria and ahab spake unto naboth saying give me thy vineyard that i may have it for a garden of herbs because it is near unto my house and i will give thee for it a better vineyard than it or if it seem good to thee i will give thee the worth of it in money and naboth said to ahab the lord forbid it me that i should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee and ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which naboth the jezreelite had spoken to him for he had said i will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers and he laid him down upon his bed and turned away his face and would eat no bread but jezebel his wife came to him and said unto him why is thy spirit so sad that thou eatest no bread and he said unto her because i spake unto naboth the jezreelite and said unto him give me thy vineyard for money or else if it please thee i will give thee another vineyard for it and he answered i will not give thee my vineyard and jezebel his wife said unto him dost thou now govern the kingdom of israel arise and eat bread and let thine heart be merry i will give thee the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite so she wrote letters in ahabs name and sealed them with his seal and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city dwelling with naboth and she wrote in the letters saying proclaim a fast and set naboth on high among the people and set two men sons of belial before him to bear witness against him saying thou didst blaspheme god and the king and then carry him out and stone him that he may die and the men of his city even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city did as jezebel had sent unto them and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them they proclaimed a fast and set naboth on high among the people and there came in two men children of belial and sat before him and the men of belial witnessed against him even against naboth in the presence of the people saying naboth did blaspheme god and the king then they carried him forth out of the city and stoned him with stones that he died then they sent to jezebel saying naboth is stoned and is dead and it came to pass when jezebel heard that naboth was stoned and was dead that jezebel said to ahab arise take possession of the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite which he refused to give thee for money for naboth is not alive but dead and it came to pass when ahab heard that naboth was dead that ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite to take possession of it and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite saying arise go down to meet ahab king of israel which is in samaria behold he is in the vineyard of naboth whither he is gone down to possess it and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus saith the lord hast thou killed and also taken possession and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus saith the lord in the place where dogs licked the blood of naboth shall dogs lick thy blood even thine and ahab said to elijah hast thou found me o mine enemy and he answered i have found thee because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the lord behold i will bring evil upon thee and will take away thy posterity and will cut off from ahab him that pisseth against the wall
