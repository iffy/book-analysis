thou trustedst they wearied thee then how wilt thou do in the swelling of jordan for even thy brethren and the house of thy father even they have dealt treacherously with thee yea they have called a multitude after thee believe them not though they speak fair words unto thee i have forsaken mine house i have left mine heritage i have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest it crieth out against me therefore have i hated it mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird the birds round about are against her come ye assemble all the beasts of the field come to devour many pastors have destroyed my vineyard they have trodden my portion under foot they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness they have made it desolate and being desolate it mourneth unto me the whole land is made desolate because no man layeth it to heart the spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness for the sword of the lord shall devour from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land no flesh shall have peace they have sown wheat but shall reap thorns they have put themselves to pain but shall not profit and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the lord thus saith the lord against all mine evil neighbours that touch the inheritance which i have caused my people israel to inherit behold i will pluck them out of their land and pluck out the house of judah from among them and it shall come to pass after that i have plucked them out i will return and have compassion on them and will bring them again every man to his heritage and every man to his land and it shall come to pass if they will diligently learn the ways of my people to swear by my name the lord liveth as they taught my people to swear by baal then shall they be built in the midst of my people but if they will not obey i will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation saith the lord thus saith the lord unto me go and get thee a linen girdle and put it upon thy loins and put it not in water so i got a girdle according to the word of the lord and put it on my loins and the word of the lord came unto me the second time saying take the girdle that thou hast got which is upon thy loins and arise go to euphrates and hide it there in a hole of the rock so i went and hid it by euphrates as the lord commanded me and it came to pass after many days that the lord said unto me arise go to euphrates and take the girdle from thence which i commanded thee to hide there then i went to euphrates and digged and took the girdle from the place where i had hid it and behold the girdle was marred it was profitable for nothing then the word of the lord came unto me saying thus saith the lord after this manner will i mar the pride of judah and the great pride of jerusalem this evil people which refuse to hear my words which walk in the imagination of their heart and walk after other gods to serve them and to worship them shall even be as this girdle which is good for nothing for as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man so have i caused to cleave unto me the whole house of israel and the whole house of judah saith the lord that they might be unto me for a people and for a name and for a praise and for a glory but they would not hear therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word thus saith the lord god of israel every bottle shall be filled with wine and they shall say unto thee do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine then shalt thou say unto them thus saith the lord behold i will fill all the inhabitants of this land even the kings that sit upon davids throne and the priests and the prophets and all the inhabitants of jerusalem with drunkenness and i will dash them one against another even the fathers and the sons together saith the lord i will not pity nor spare nor have mercy but destroy them hear ye and give ear be not proud for the lord hath spoken give glory to the lord your god before he cause darkness and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains and while ye look for light he turn it into the shadow of death and make it gross darkness but if ye will not hear it my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride and mine eye shall weep sore and run down with tears because the lords flock is carried away captive say unto the king and to the queen humble yourselves sit down for your principalities shall come down even the crown of your glory the cities of the south shall be shut up and none shall open them judah shall be carried away captive all of it it shall be wholly carried away captive lift up your eyes and behold them that come from the north where is the flock that was given thee thy beautiful flock what wilt thou say when he shall punish thee for thou hast taught them to be captains and as chief over thee shall not sorrows take thee as a woman in travail and if thou say in thine heart wherefore come these things upon me for the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered and thy heels made bare can the ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots then may ye also do good that are accustomed to do evil therefore will i scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness this is thy lot the portion of thy measures from me saith the lord because thou hast forgotten me and
