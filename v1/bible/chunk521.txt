will i cleanse you a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i will give you an heart of flesh and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them and ye shall dwell in the land that i gave to your fathers and ye shall be my people and i will be your god i will also save you from all your uncleannesses and i will call for the corn and will increase it and lay no famine upon you and i will multiply the fruit of the tree and the increase of the field that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen then shall ye remember your own evil ways and your doings that were not good and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations not for your sakes do i this saith the lord god be it known unto you be ashamed and confounded for your own ways o house of israel thus saith the lord god in the day that i shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities i will also cause you to dwell in the cities and the wastes shall be builded and the desolate land shall be tilled whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by and they shall say this land that was desolate is become like the garden of eden and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced and are inhabited then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that i the lord build the ruined places and plant that that was desolate i the lord have spoken it and i will do it thus saith the lord god i will yet for this be enquired of by the house of israel to do it for them i will increase them with men like a flock as the holy flock as the flock of jerusalem in her solemn feasts so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men and they shall know that i am the lord the hand of the lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones and caused me to pass by them round about and behold there were very many in the open valley and lo they were very dry and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and i answered o lord god thou knowest again he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and say unto them o ye dry bones hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord god unto these bones behold i will cause breath to enter into you and ye shall live and i will lay sinews upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and ye shall live and ye shall know that i am the lord so i prophesied as i was commanded and as i prophesied there was a noise and behold a shaking and the bones came together bone to his bone and when i beheld lo the sinews and the flesh came up upon them and the skin covered them above but there was no breath in them then said he unto me prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind thus saith the lord god come from the four winds o breath and breathe upon these slain that they may live so i prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived and stood up upon their feet an exceeding great army then he said unto me son of man these bones are the whole house of israel behold they say our bones are dried and our hope is lost we are cut off for our parts therefore prophesy and say unto them thus saith the lord god behold o my people i will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves and bring you into the land of israel and ye shall know that i am the lord when i have opened your graves o my people and brought you up out of your graves and shall put my spirit in you and ye shall live and i shall place you in your own land then shall ye know that i the lord have spoken it and performed it saith the lord the word of the lord came again unto me saying moreover thou son of man take thee one stick and write upon it for judah and for the children of israel his companions then take another stick and write upon it for joseph the stick of ephraim and for all the house of israel his companions and join them one to another into one stick and they shall become one in thine hand and when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee saying wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these say unto them thus saith the lord god behold i will take the stick of joseph which is in the hand of ephraim and the tribes of israel his fellows and will put them with him even with the stick of judah and make them one stick and they shall be one in mine hand and the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes and say unto them thus saith the lord god behold i will take the children of israel from among the heathen whither they be gone and will gather them on every side and bring them into their own land and i will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of israel and one king shall be king to them all and they shall be no more two nations neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols nor with their detestable things nor with any of
