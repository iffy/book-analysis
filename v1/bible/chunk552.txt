beseech thee by whom shall jacob arise for he is small the lord repented for this this also shall not be saith the lord god thus he shewed me and behold the lord stood upon a wall made by a plumbline with a plumbline in his hand and the lord said unto me amos what seest thou and i said a plumbline then said the lord behold i will set a plumbline in the midst of my people israel i will not again pass by them any more and the high places of isaac shall be desolate and the sanctuaries of israel shall be laid waste and i will rise against the house of jeroboam with the sword then amaziah the priest of bethel sent to jeroboam king of israel saying amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of israel the land is not able to bear all his words for thus amos saith jeroboam shall die by the sword and israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land also amaziah said unto amos o thou seer go flee thee away into the land of judah and there eat bread and prophesy there but prophesy not again any more at bethel for it is the kings chapel and it is the kings court then answered amos and said to amaziah i was no prophet neither was i a prophets son but i was an herdman and a gatherer of sycomore fruit and the lord took me as i followed the flock and the lord said unto me go prophesy unto my people israel now therefore hear thou the word of the lord thou sayest prophesy not against israel and drop not thy word against the house of isaac therefore thus saith the lord thy wife shall be an harlot in the city and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword and thy land shall be divided by line and thou shalt die in a polluted land and israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land thus hath the lord god shewed unto me and behold a basket of summer fruit and he said amos what seest thou and i said a basket of summer fruit then said the lord unto me the end is come upon my people of israel i will not again pass by them any more and the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day saith the lord god there shall be many dead bodies in every place they shall cast them forth with silence hear this o ye that swallow up the needy even to make the poor of the land to fail saying when will the new moon be gone that we may sell corn and the sabbath that we may set forth wheat making the ephah small and the shekel great and falsifying the balances by deceit that we may buy the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of shoes yea and sell the refuse of the wheat the lord hath sworn by the excellency of jacob surely i will never forget any of their works shall not the land tremble for this and every one mourn that dwelleth therein and it shall rise up wholly as a flood and it shall be cast out and drowned as by the flood of egypt and it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord god that i will cause the sun to go down at noon and i will darken the earth in the clear day and i will turn your feasts into mourning and all your songs into lamentation and i will bring up sackcloth upon all loins and baldness upon every head and i will make it as the mourning of an only son and the end thereof as a bitter day behold the days come saith the lord god that i will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water but of hearing the words of the lord and they shall wander from sea to sea and from the north even to the east they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the lord and shall not find it in that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst they that swear by the sin of samaria and say thy god o dan liveth and the manner of beersheba liveth even they shall fall and never rise up again i saw the lord standing upon the altar and he said smite the lintel of the door that the posts may shake and cut them in the head all of them and i will slay the last of them with the sword he that fleeth of them shall not flee away and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered though they dig into hell thence shall mine hand take them though they climb up to heaven thence will i bring them down and though they hide themselves in the top of carmel i will search and take them out thence and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea thence will i command the serpent and he shall bite them and though they go into captivity before their enemies thence will i command the sword and it shall slay them and i will set mine eyes upon them for evil and not for good and the lord god of hosts is he that toucheth the land and it shall melt and all that dwell therein shall mourn and it shall rise up wholly like a flood and shall be drowned as by the flood of egypt it is he that buildeth his stories in the heaven and hath founded his troop in the earth he that calleth for the waters of the sea and poureth them out upon the face of the earth the lord is his name are ye not as children of the ethiopians unto me o children of israel saith the lord have not i brought up israel out of the land of egypt and the philistines from caphtor and the syrians from kir behold the eyes of the lord god are upon the sinful kingdom and i will destroy it from off the face of
