and say unto them when i bring the sword upon a land if the people of the land take a man of their coasts and set him for their watchman if when he seeth the sword come upon the land he blow the trumpet and warn the people then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet and taketh not warning if the sword come and take him away his blood shall be upon his own head he heard the sound of the trumpet and took not warning his blood shall be upon him but he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul but if the watchman see the sword come and blow not the trumpet and the people be not warned if the sword come and take any person from among them he is taken away in his iniquity but his blood will i require at the watchmans hand so thou o son of man i have set thee a watchman unto the house of israel therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth and warn them from me when i say unto the wicked o wicked man thou shalt surely die if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way that wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will i require at thine hand nevertheless if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it if he do not turn from his way he shall die in his iniquity but thou hast delivered thy soul therefore o thou son of man speak unto the house of israel thus ye speak saying if our transgressions and our sins be upon us and we pine away in them how should we then live say unto them as i live saith the lord god i have no pleasure in the death of the wicked but that the wicked turn from his way and live turn ye turn ye from your evil ways for why will ye die o house of israel therefore thou son of man say unto the children of thy people the righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression as for the wickedness of the wicked he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth when i shall say to the righteous that he shall surely live if he trust to his own righteousness and commit iniquity all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered but for his iniquity that he hath committed he shall die for it again when i say unto the wicked thou shalt surely die if he turn from his sin and do that which is lawful and right if the wicked restore the pledge give again that he had robbed walk in the statutes of life without committing iniquity he shall surely live he shall not die none of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him he hath done that which is lawful and right he shall surely live yet the children of thy people say the way of the lord is not equal but as for them their way is not equal when the righteous turneth from his righteousness and committeth iniquity he shall even die thereby but if the wicked turn from his wickedness and do that which is lawful and right he shall live thereby yet ye say the way of the lord is not equal o ye house of israel i will judge you every one after his ways and it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity in the tenth month in the fifth day of the month that one that had escaped out of jerusalem came unto me saying the city is smitten now the hand of the lord was upon me in the evening afore he that was escaped came and had opened my mouth until he came to me in the morning and my mouth was opened and i was no more dumb then the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man they that inhabit those wastes of the land of israel speak saying abraham was one and he inherited the land but we are many the land is given us for inheritance wherefore say unto them thus saith the lord god ye eat with the blood and lift up your eyes toward your idols and shed blood and shall ye possess the land ye stand upon your sword ye work abomination and ye defile every one his neighbours wife and shall ye possess the land say thou thus unto them thus saith the lord god as i live surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword and him that is in the open field will i give to the beasts to be devoured and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence for i will lay the land most desolate and the pomp of her strength shall cease and the mountains of israel shall be desolate that none shall pass through then shall they know that i am the lord when i have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed also thou son of man the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses and speak one to another every one to his brother saying come i pray you and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the lord and they come unto thee as the people cometh and they sit before thee as my people and they hear thy words but they will not do them for with their mouth they shew much love but their heart goeth after their covetousness and lo thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice and can play well on an instrument for they hear thy words but they do them not and when this cometh to pass lo it will come then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man prophesy against the shepherds
