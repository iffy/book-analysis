unto thine handmaid saying assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne why then doth adonijah reign behold while thou yet talkest there with the king i also will come in after thee and confirm thy words and bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber and the king was very old and abishag the shunammite ministered unto the king and bathsheba bowed and did obeisance unto the king and the king said what wouldest thou and she said unto him my lord thou swarest by the lord thy god unto thine handmaid saying assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne and now behold adonijah reigneth and now my lord the king thou knowest it not and he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance and hath called all the sons of the king and abiathar the priest and joab the captain of the host but solomon thy servant hath he not called and thou my lord o king the eyes of all israel are upon thee that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him otherwise it shall come to pass when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers that i and my son solomon shall be counted offenders and lo while she yet talked with the king nathan the prophet also came in and they told the king saying behold nathan the prophet and when he was come in before the king he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground and nathan said my lord o king hast thou said adonijah shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne for he is gone down this day and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance and hath called all the kings sons and the captains of the host and abiathar the priest and behold they eat and drink before him and say god save king adonijah but me even me thy servant and zadok the priest and benaiah the son of jehoiada and thy servant solomon hath he not called is this thing done by my lord the king and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him then king david answered and said call me bathsheba and she came into the kings presence and stood before the king and the king sware and said as the lord liveth that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress even as i sware unto thee by the lord god of israel saying assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead even so will i certainly do this day then bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth and did reverence to the king and said let my lord king david live for ever and king david said call me zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and they came before the king the king also said unto them take with you the servants of your lord and cause solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule and bring him down to gihon and let zadok the priest and nathan the prophet anoint him there king over israel and blow ye with the trumpet and say god save king solomon then ye shall come up after him that he may come and sit upon my throne for he shall be king in my stead and i have appointed him to be ruler over israel and over judah and benaiah the son of jehoiada answered the king and said amen the lord god of my lord the king say so too as the lord hath been with my lord the king even so be he with solomon and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king david so zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and the cherethites and the pelethites went down and caused solomon to ride upon king davids mule and brought him to gihon and zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle and anointed solomon and they blew the trumpet and all the people said god save king solomon and all the people came up after him and the people piped with pipes and rejoiced with great joy so that the earth rent with the sound of them and adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating and when joab heard the sound of the trumpet he said wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar and while he yet spake behold jonathan the son of abiathar the priest came and adonijah said unto him come in for thou art a valiant man and bringest good tidings and jonathan answered and said to adonijah verily our lord king david hath made solomon king and the king hath sent with him zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and the cherethites and the pelethites and they have caused him to ride upon the kings mule and zadok the priest and nathan the prophet have anointed him king in gihon and they are come up from thence rejoicing so that the city rang again this is the noise that ye have heard and also solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom and moreover the kings servants came to bless our lord king david saying god make the name of solomon better than thy name and make his throne greater than thy throne and the king bowed himself upon the bed and also thus said the king blessed be the lord god of israel which hath given one to sit on my throne this day mine eyes even seeing it and all the guests that were with adonijah were afraid and rose up and went every man his way and adonijah feared because of solomon and arose and went and caught hold on the horns of the altar and it was told solomon saying behold adonijah feareth king solomon for lo he hath caught hold
