his own sepulchres which he had made for himself in the city of david and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries art and they made a very great burning for him and jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead and strengthened himself against israel and he placed forces in all the fenced cities of judah and set garrisons in the land of judah and in the cities of ephraim which asa his father had taken and the lord was with jehoshaphat because he walked in the first ways of his father david and sought not unto baalim but sought to the lord god of his father and walked in his commandments and not after the doings of israel therefore the lord stablished the kingdom in his hand and all judah brought to jehoshaphat presents and he had riches and honour in abundance and his heart was lifted up in the ways of the lord moreover he took away the high places and groves out of judah also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes even to benhail and to obadiah and to zechariah and to nethaneel and to michaiah to teach in the cities of judah and with them he sent levites even shemaiah and nethaniah and zebadiah and asahel and shemiramoth and jehonathan and adonijah and tobijah and tobadonijah levites and with them elishama and jehoram priests and they taught in judah and had the book of the law of the lord with them and went about throughout all the cities of judah and taught the people and the fear of the lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about judah so that they made no war against jehoshaphat also some of the philistines brought jehoshaphat presents and tribute silver and the arabians brought him flocks seven thousand and seven hundred rams and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats and jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly and he built in judah castles and cities of store and he had much business in the cities of judah and the men of war mighty men of valour were in jerusalem and these are the numbers of them according to the house of their fathers of judah the captains of thousands adnah the chief and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand and next to him was jehohanan the captain and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand and next him was amasiah the son of zichri who willingly offered himself unto the lord and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour and of benjamin eliada a mighty man of valour and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand and next him was jehozabad and with him an hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war these waited on the king beside those whom the king put in the fenced cities throughout all judah now jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance and joined affinity with ahab and after certain years he went down to ahab to samaria and ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance and for the people that he had with him and persuaded him to go up with him to ramothgilead and ahab king of israel said unto jehoshaphat king of judah wilt thou go with me to ramothgilead and he answered him i am as thou art and my people as thy people and we will be with thee in the war and jehoshaphat said unto the king of israel enquire i pray thee at the word of the lord to day therefore the king of israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men and said unto them shall we go to ramothgilead to battle or shall i forbear and they said go up for god will deliver it into the kings hand but jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord besides that we might enquire of him and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat there is yet one man by whom we may enquire of the lord but i hate him for he never prophesied good unto me but always evil the same is micaiah the son of imla and jehoshaphat said let not the king say so and the king of israel called for one of his officers and said fetch quickly micaiah the son of imla and the king of israel and jehoshaphat king of judah sat either of them on his throne clothed in their robes and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of samaria and all the prophets prophesied before them and zedekiah the son of chenaanah had made him horns of iron and said thus saith the lord with these thou shalt push syria until they be consumed and all the prophets prophesied so saying go up to ramothgilead and prosper for the lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king and the messenger that went to call micaiah spake to him saying behold the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent let thy word therefore i pray thee be like one of theirs and speak thou good and micaiah said as the lord liveth even what my god saith that will i speak and when he was come to the king the king said unto him micaiah shall we go to ramothgilead to battle or shall i forbear and he said go ye up and prosper and they shall be delivered into your hand and the king said to him how many times shall i adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the lord then he said i did see all israel scattered upon the mountains as sheep that have no shepherd and the lord said these have no master let them return therefore every man to his house in peace and the king of israel said to jehoshaphat did i not tell thee that he would not prophesy good unto me but evil again he said therefore hear the word of the lord i saw the lord sitting upon his throne and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left
