david behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of saul so that his name was much set by and saul spake to jonathan his son and to all his servants that they should kill david but jonathan sauls son delighted much in david and jonathan told david saying saul my father seeketh to kill thee now therefore i pray thee take heed to thyself until the morning and abide in a secret place and hide thyself and i will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art and i will commune with my father of thee and what i see that i will tell thee and jonathan spake good of david unto saul his father and said unto him let not the king sin against his servant against david because he hath not sinned against thee and because his works have been to thee-ward very good for he did put his life in his hand and slew the philistine and the lord wrought a great salvation for all israel thou sawest it and didst rejoice wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood to slay david without a cause and saul hearkened unto the voice of jonathan and saul sware as the lord liveth he shall not be slain and jonathan called david and jonathan shewed him all those things and jonathan brought david to saul and he was in his presence as in times past and there was war again and david went out and fought with the philistines and slew them with a great slaughter and they fled from him and the evil spirit from the lord was upon saul as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand and david played with his hand and saul sought to smite david even to the wall with the javelin but he slipped away out of sauls presence and he smote the javelin into the wall and david fled and escaped that night saul also sent messengers unto davids house to watch him and to slay him in the morning and michal davids wife told him saying if thou save not thy life to night to morrow thou shalt be slain so michal let david down through a window and he went and fled and escaped and michal took an image and laid it in the bed and put a pillow of goats hair for his bolster and covered it with a cloth and when saul sent messengers to take david she said he is sick and saul sent the messengers again to see david saying bring him up to me in the bed that i may slay him and when the messengers were come in behold there was an image in the bed with a pillow of goats hair for his bolster and saul said unto michal why hast thou deceived me so and sent away mine enemy that he is escaped and michal answered saul he said unto me let me go why should i kill thee so david fled and escaped and came to samuel to ramah and told him all that saul had done to him and he and samuel went and dwelt in naioth and it was told saul saying behold david is at naioth in ramah and saul sent messengers to take david and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying and samuel standing as appointed over them the spirit of god was upon the messengers of saul and they also prophesied and when it was told saul he sent other messengers and they prophesied likewise and saul sent messengers again the third time and they prophesied also then went he also to ramah and came to a great well that is in sechu and he asked and said where are samuel and david and one said behold they be at naioth in ramah and he went thither to naioth in ramah and the spirit of god was upon him also and he went on and prophesied until he came to naioth in ramah and he stripped off his clothes also and prophesied before samuel in like manner and lay down naked all that day and all that night wherefore they say is saul also among the prophets and david fled from naioth in ramah and came and said before jonathan what have i done what is mine iniquity and what is my sin before thy father that he seeketh my life and he said unto him god forbid thou shalt not die behold my father will do nothing either great or small but that he will shew it me and why should my father hide this thing from me it is not so and david sware moreover and said thy father certainly knoweth that i have found grace in thine eyes and he saith let not jonathan know this lest he be grieved but truly as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth there is but a step between me and death then said jonathan unto david whatsoever thy soul desireth i will even do it for thee and david said unto jonathan behold to morrow is the new moon and i should not fail to sit with the king at meat but let me go that i may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even if thy father at all miss me then say david earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to bethlehem his city for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family if he say thus it is well thy servant shall have peace but if he be very wroth then be sure that evil is determined by him therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the lord with thee notwithstanding if there be in me iniquity slay me thyself for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father and jonathan said far be it from thee for if i knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee then would not i tell it thee then said david to jonathan who shall tell me or what if thy father answer thee roughly and jonathan said unto david come and let us go out into the field and they went out
