all the mercies and of all the truth which thou hast shewed unto thy servant for with my staff i passed over this jordan and now i am become two bands deliver me i pray thee from the hand of my brother from the hand of esau for i fear him lest he will come and smite me and the mother with the children and thou saidst i will surely do thee good and make thy seed as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered for multitude and he lodged there that same night and took of that which came to his hand a present for esau his brother two hundred she goats and twenty he goats two hundred ewes and twenty rams thirty milch camels with their colts forty kine and ten bulls twenty she asses and ten foals and he delivered them into the hand of his servants every drove by themselves and said unto his servants pass over before me and put a space betwixt drove and drove and he commanded the foremost saying when esau my brother meeteth thee and asketh thee saying whose art thou and whither goest thou and whose are these before thee then thou shalt say they be thy servant jacobs it is a present sent unto my lord esau and behold also he is behind us and so commanded he the second and the third and all that followed the droves saying on this manner shall ye speak unto esau when ye find him and say ye moreover behold thy servant jacob is behind us for he said i will appease him with the present that goeth before me and afterward i will see his face peradventure he will accept of me so went the present over before him and himself lodged that night in the company and he rose up that night and took his two wives and his two womenservants and his eleven sons and passed over the ford jabbok and he took them and sent them over the brook and sent over that he had and jacob was left alone and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of jacobs thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him and he said let me go for the day breaketh and he said i will not let thee go except thou bless me and he said unto him what is thy name and he said jacob and he said thy name shall be called no more jacob but israel for as a prince hast thou power with god and with men and hast prevailed and jacob asked him and said tell me i pray thee thy name and he said wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name and he blessed him there and jacob called the name of the place peniel for i have seen god face to face and my life is preserved and as he passed over penuel the sun rose upon him and he halted upon his thigh therefore the children of israel eat not of the sinew which shrank which is upon the hollow of the thigh unto this day because he touched the hollow of jacobs thigh in the sinew that shrank and jacob lifted up his eyes and looked and behold esau came and with him four hundred men and he divided the children unto leah and unto rachel and unto the two handmaids and he put the handmaids and their children foremost and leah and her children after and rachel and joseph hindermost and he passed over before them and bowed himself to the ground seven times until he came near to his brother and esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him and they wept and he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the children and said who are those with thee and he said the children which god hath graciously given thy servant then the handmaidens came near they and their children and they bowed themselves and leah also with her children came near and bowed themselves and after came joseph near and rachel and they bowed themselves and he said what meanest thou by all this drove which i met and he said these are to find grace in the sight of my lord and esau said i have enough my brother keep that thou hast unto thyself and jacob said nay i pray thee if now i have found grace in thy sight then receive my present at my hand for therefore i have seen thy face as though i had seen the face of god and thou wast pleased with me take i pray thee my blessing that is brought to thee because god hath dealt graciously with me and because i have enough and he urged him and he took it and he said let us take our journey and let us go and i will go before thee and he said unto him my lord knoweth that the children are tender and the flocks and herds with young are with me and if men should overdrive them one day all the flock will die let my lord i pray thee pass over before his servant and i will lead on softly according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure until i come unto my lord unto seir and esau said let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me and he said what needeth it let me find grace in the sight of my lord so esau returned that day on his way unto seir and jacob journeyed to succoth and built him an house and made booths for his cattle therefore the name of the place is called succoth and jacob came to shalem a city of shechem which is in the land of canaan when he came from padanaram and pitched his tent before the city and he bought a parcel of a field where he had spread his tent at the hand of the children of hamor shechems father for an hundred pieces of money and he
