other matters it shall be determined in a lawful assembly for we are in danger to be called in question for this days uproar there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse and when he had thus spoken he dismissed the assembly and after the uproar was ceased paul called unto him the disciples and embraced them and departed for to go into macedonia and when he had gone over those parts and had given them much exhortation he came into greece and there abode three months and when the jews laid wait for him as he was about to sail into syria he purposed to return through macedonia and there accompanied him into asia sopater of berea and of the thessalonians aristarchus and secundus and gaius of derbe and timotheus and of asia tychicus and trophimus these going before tarried for us at troas and we sailed away from philippi after the days of unleavened bread and came unto them to troas in five days where we abode seven days and upon the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread paul preached unto them ready to depart on the morrow and continued his speech until midnight and there were many lights in the upper chamber where they were gathered together and there sat in a window a certain young man named eutychus being fallen into a deep sleep and as paul was long preaching he sunk down with sleep and fell down from the third loft and was taken up dead and paul went down and fell on him and embracing him said trouble not yourselves for his life is in him when he therefore was come up again and had broken bread and eaten and talked a long while even till break of day so he departed and they brought the young man alive and were not a little comforted and we went before to ship and sailed unto assos there intending to take in paul for so had he appointed minding himself to go afoot and when he met with us at assos we took him in and came to mitylene and we sailed thence and came the next day over against chios and the next day we arrived at samos and tarried at trogyllium and the next day we came to miletus for paul had determined to sail by ephesus because he would not spend the time in asia for he hasted if it were possible for him to be at jerusalem the day of pentecost and from miletus he sent to ephesus and called the elders of the church and when they were come to him he said unto them ye know from the first day that i came into asia after what manner i have been with you at all seasons serving the lord with all humility of mind and with many tears and temptations which befell me by the lying in wait of the jews and how i kept back nothing that was profitable unto you but have shewed you and have taught you publickly and from house to house testifying both to the jews and also to the greeks repentance toward god and faith toward our lord jesus christ and now behold i go bound in the spirit unto jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me there save that the holy ghost witnesseth in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide me but none of these things move me neither count i my life dear unto myself so that i might finish my course with joy and the ministry which i have received of the lord jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of god and now behold i know that ye all among whom i have gone preaching the kingdom of god shall see my face no more wherefore i take you to record this day that i am pure from the blood of all men for i have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of god take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over the which the holy ghost hath made you overseers to feed the church of god which he hath purchased with his own blood for i know this that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years i ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears and now brethren i commend you to god and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified i have coveted no mans silver or gold or apparel yea ye yourselves know that these hands have ministered unto my necessities and to them that were with me i have shewed you all things how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak and to remember the words of the lord jesus how he said it is more blessed to give than to receive and when he had thus spoken he kneeled down and prayed with them all and they all wept sore and fell on pauls neck and kissed him sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake that they should see his face no more and they accompanied him unto the ship and it came to pass that after we were gotten from them and had launched we came with a straight course unto coos and the day following unto rhodes and from thence unto patara and finding a ship sailing over unto phenicia we went aboard and set forth now when we had discovered cyprus we left it on the left hand and sailed into syria and landed at tyre for there the ship was to unlade her burden and finding disciples we tarried there seven days who said to paul through the spirit that he should not go up to jerusalem and when we had accomplished those days we departed and went our way and they all brought us on our way with wives and children till we were out of the city and we kneeled down on the
