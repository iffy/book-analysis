to them which were in hormah and to them which were in chorashan and to them which were in athach and to them which were in hebron and to all the places where david himself and his men were wont to haunt now the philistines fought against israel and the men of israel fled from before the philistines and fell down slain in mount gilboa and the philistines followed hard upon saul and upon his sons and the philistines slew jonathan and abinadab and melchishua sauls sons and the battle went sore against saul and the archers hit him and he was sore wounded of the archers then said saul unto his armourbearer draw thy sword and thrust me through therewith lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through and abuse me but his armourbearer would not for he was sore afraid therefore saul took a sword and fell upon it and when his armourbearer saw that saul was dead he fell likewise upon his sword and died with him so saul died and his three sons and his armourbearer and all his men that same day together and when the men of israel that were on the other side of the valley and they that were on the other side jordan saw that the men of israel fled and that saul and his sons were dead they forsook the cities and fled and the philistines came and dwelt in them and it came to pass on the morrow when the philistines came to strip the slain that they found saul and his three sons fallen in mount gilboa and they cut off his head and stripped off his armour and sent into the land of the philistines round about to publish it in the house of their idols and among the people and they put his armour in the house of ashtaroth and they fastened his body to the wall of bethshan and when the inhabitants of jabeshgilead heard of that which the philistines had done to saul all the valiant men arose and went all night and took the body of saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of bethshan and came to jabesh and burnt them there and they took their bones and buried them under a tree at jabesh and fasted seven days the second book of samuel otherwise called the second book of the kings now it came to pass after the death of saul when david was returned from the slaughter of the amalekites and david had abode two days in ziklag it came even to pass on the third day that behold a man came out of the camp from saul with his clothes rent and earth upon his head and so it was when he came to david that he fell to the earth and did obeisance and david said unto him from whence comest thou and he said unto him out of the camp of israel am i escaped and david said unto him how went the matter i pray thee tell me and he answered that the people are fled from the battle and many of the people also are fallen and dead and saul and jonathan his son are dead also and david said unto the young man that told him how knowest thou that saul and jonathan his son be dead and the young man that told him said as i happened by chance upon mount gilboa behold saul leaned upon his spear and lo the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him and when he looked behind him he saw me and called unto me and i answered here am i and he said unto me who art thou and i answered him i am an amalekite he said unto me again stand i pray thee upon me and slay me for anguish is come upon me because my life is yet whole in me so i stood upon him and slew him because i was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen and i took the crown that was upon his head and the bracelet that was on his arm and have brought them hither unto my lord then david took hold on his clothes and rent them and likewise all the men that were with him and they mourned and wept and fasted until even for saul and for jonathan his son and for the people of the lord and for the house of israel because they were fallen by the sword and david said unto the young man that told him whence art thou and he answered i am the son of a stranger an amalekite and david said unto him how wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the lords anointed and david called one of the young men and said go near and fall upon him and he smote him that he died and david said unto him thy blood be upon thy head for thy mouth hath testified against thee saying i have slain the lords anointed and david lamented with this lamentation over saul and over jonathan his son also he bade them teach the children of judah the use of the bow behold it is written in the book of jasher the beauty of israel is slain upon thy high places how are the mighty fallen tell it not in gath publish it not in the streets of askelon lest the daughters of the philistines rejoice lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph ye mountains of gilboa let there be no dew neither let there be rain upon you nor fields of offerings for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away the shield of saul as though he had not been anointed with oil from the blood of the slain from the fat of the mighty the bow of jonathan turned not back and the sword of saul returned not empty saul and jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives and in their death they were not divided they were swifter than eagles they were stronger than lions ye daughters of israel weep over saul who clothed you in scarlet with other delights who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel how are the mighty fallen in the midst of the
