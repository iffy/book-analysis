and caleb said he that smiteth kirjathsepher and taketh it to him will i give achsah my daughter to wife and othniel the son of kenaz calebs younger brother took it and he gave him achsah his daughter to wife and it came to pass when she came to him that she moved him to ask of her father a field and she lighted from off her ass and caleb said unto her what wilt thou and she said unto him give me a blessing for thou hast given me a south land give me also springs of water and caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs and the children of the kenite moses father in law went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of judah into the wilderness of judah which lieth in the south of arad and they went and dwelt among the people and judah went with simeon his brother and they slew the canaanites that inhabited zephath and utterly destroyed it and the name of the city was called hormah also judah took gaza with the coast thereof and askelon with the coast thereof and ekron with the coast thereof and the lord was with judah and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had chariots of iron and they gave hebron unto caleb as moses said and he expelled thence the three sons of anak and the children of benjamin did not drive out the jebusites that inhabited jerusalem but the jebusites dwell with the children of benjamin in jerusalem unto this day and the house of joseph they also went up against bethel and the lord was with them and the house of joseph sent to descry bethel now the name of the city before was luz and the spies saw a man come forth out of the city and they said unto him shew us we pray thee the entrance into the city and we will shew thee mercy and when he shewed them the entrance into the city they smote the city with the edge of the sword but they let go the man and all his family and the man went into the land of the hittites and built a city and called the name thereof luz which is the name thereof unto this day neither did manasseh drive out the inhabitants of bethshean and her towns nor taanach and her towns nor the inhabitants of dor and her towns nor the inhabitants of ibleam and her towns nor the inhabitants of megiddo and her towns but the canaanites would dwell in that land and it came to pass when israel was strong that they put the canaanites to tribute and did not utterly drive them out neither did ephraim drive out the canaanites that dwelt in gezer but the canaanites dwelt in gezer among them neither did zebulun drive out the inhabitants of kitron nor the inhabitants of nahalol but the canaanites dwelt among them and became tributaries neither did asher drive out the inhabitants of accho nor the inhabitants of zidon nor of ahlab nor of achzib nor of helbah nor of aphik nor of rehob but the asherites dwelt among the canaanites the inhabitants of the land for they did not drive them out neither did naphtali drive out the inhabitants of bethshemesh nor the inhabitants of bethanath but he dwelt among the canaanites the inhabitants of the land nevertheless the inhabitants of bethshemesh and of bethanath became tributaries unto them and the amorites forced the children of dan into the mountain for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley but the amorites would dwell in mount heres in aijalon and in shaalbim yet the hand of the house of joseph prevailed so that they became tributaries and the coast of the amorites was from the going up to akrabbim from the rock and upward and an angel of the lord came up from gilgal to bochim and said i made you to go up out of egypt and have brought you unto the land which i sware unto your fathers and i said i will never break my covenant with you and ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land ye shall throw down their altars but ye have not obeyed my voice why have ye done this wherefore i also said i will not drive them out from before you but they shall be as thorns in your sides and their gods shall be a snare unto you and it came to pass when the angel of the lord spake these words unto all the children of israel that the people lifted up their voice and wept and they called the name of that place bochim and they sacrificed there unto the lord and when joshua had let the people go the children of israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land and the people served the lord all the days of joshua and all the days of the elders that outlived joshua who had seen all the great works of the lord that he did for israel and joshua the son of nun the servant of the lord died being an hundred and ten years old and they buried him in the border of his inheritance in timnathheres in the mount of ephraim on the north side of the hill gaash and also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers and there arose another generation after them which knew not the lord nor yet the works which he had done for israel and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord and served baalim and they forsook the lord god of their fathers which brought them out of the land of egypt and followed other gods of the gods of the people that were round about them and bowed themselves unto them and provoked the lord to anger and they forsook the lord and served baal and ashtaroth and the anger of the lord was hot against israel and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about so that they could not
