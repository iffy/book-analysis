princes altogether kings is not calno as carchemish is not hamath as arpad is not samaria as damascus as my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols and whose graven images did excel them of jerusalem and of samaria shall i not as i have done unto samaria and her idols so do to jerusalem and her idols wherefore it shall come to pass that when the lord hath performed his whole work upon mount zion and on jerusalem i will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of assyria and the glory of his high looks for he saith by the strength of my hand i have done it and by my wisdom for i am prudent and i have removed the bounds of the people and have robbed their treasures and i have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man and my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people and as one gathereth eggs that are left have i gathered all the earth and there was none that moved the wing or opened the mouth or peeped shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up or as if the staff should lift up itself as if it were no wood therefore shall the lord the lord of hosts send among his fat ones leanness and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire and the light of israel shall be for a fire and his holy one for a flame and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day and shall consume the glory of his forest and of his fruitful field both soul and body and they shall be as when a standard-bearer fainteth and the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few that a child may write them and it shall come to pass in that day that the remnant of israel and such as are escaped of the house of jacob shall no more again stay upon him that smote them but shall stay upon the lord the holy one of israel in truth the remnant shall return even the remnant of jacob unto the mighty god for though thy people israel be as the sand of the sea yet a remnant of them shall return the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness for the lord god of hosts shall make a consumption even determined in the midst of all the land therefore thus saith the lord god of hosts o my people that dwellest in zion be not afraid of the assyrian he shall smite thee with a rod and shall lift up his staff against thee after the manner of egypt for yet a very little while and the indignation shall cease and mine anger in their destruction and the lord of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of midian at the rock of oreb and as his rod was upon the sea so shall he lift it up after the manner of egypt and it shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder and his yoke from off thy neck and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing he is come to aiath he is passed to migron at michmash he hath laid up his carriages they are gone over the passage they have taken up their lodging at geba ramah is afraid gibeah of saul is fled lift up thy voice o daughter of gallim cause it to be heard unto laish o poor anathoth madmenah is removed the inhabitants of gebim gather themselves to flee as yet shall he remain at nob that day he shall shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of zion the hill of jerusalem behold the lord the lord of hosts shall lop the bough with terror and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down and the haughty shall be humbled and he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron and lebanon shall fall by a mighty one and there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of jesse and a branch shall grow out of his roots and the spirit of the lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the lord and shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the lord and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes neither reprove after the hearing of his ears but with righteousness shall he judge the poor and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked and righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins and faithfulness the girdle of his reins the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb and the leopard shall lie down with the kid and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together and a little child shall lead them and the cow and the bear shall feed their young ones shall lie down together and the lion shall eat straw like the ox and the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice den they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the lord as the waters cover the sea and in that day there shall be a root of jesse which shall stand for an ensign of the people to it shall the gentiles seek and his rest shall be glorious and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people which shall be left from assyria and from egypt and from pathros and from cush and from elam and from shinar and from hamath and
