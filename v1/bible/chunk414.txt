eyes to behold the sun but if a man live many years and rejoice in them all yet let him remember the days of darkness for they shall be many all that cometh is vanity rejoice o young man in thy youth and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth and walk in the ways of thine heart and in the sight of thine eyes but know thou that for all these things god will bring thee into judgment therefore remove sorrow from thy heart and put away evil from thy flesh for childhood and youth are vanity remember now thy creator in the days of thy youth while the evil days come not nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt say i have no pleasure in them while the sun or the light or the moon or the stars be not darkened nor the clouds return after the rain in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble and the strong men shall bow themselves and the grinders cease because they are few and those that look out of the windows be darkened and the doors shall be shut in the streets when the sound of the grinding is low and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low also when they shall be afraid of that which is high and fears shall be in the way and the almond tree shall flourish and the grasshopper shall be a burden and desire shall fail because man goeth to his long home and the mourners go about the streets or ever the silver cord be loosed or the golden bowl be broken or the pitcher be broken at the fountain or the wheel broken at the cistern then shall the dust return to the earth as it was and the spirit shall return unto god who gave it vanity of vanities saith the preacher all is vanity and moreover because the preacher was wise he still taught the people knowledge yea he gave good heed and sought out and set in order many proverbs the preacher sought to find out acceptable words and that which was written was upright even words of truth the words of the wise are as goads and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies which are given from one shepherd and further by these my son be admonished of making many books there is no end and much study is a weariness of the flesh let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear god and keep his commandments for this is the whole duty of man for god shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil the song of solomon the song of songs which is solomons let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth for thy love is better than wine because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth therefore do the virgins love thee draw me we will run after thee the king hath brought me into his chambers we will be glad and rejoice in thee we will remember thy love more than wine the upright love thee i am black but comely o ye daughters of jerusalem as the tents of kedar as the curtains of solomon look not upon me because i am black because the sun hath looked upon me my mothers children were angry with me they made me the keeper of the vineyards but mine own vineyard have i not kept tell me o thou whom my soul loveth where thou feedest where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon for why should i be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions if thou know not o thou fairest among women go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock and feed thy kids beside the shepherds tents i have compared thee o my love to a company of horses in pharaohs chariots thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels thy neck with chains of gold we will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver while the king sitteth at his table my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof a bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts my beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of engedi behold thou art fair my love behold thou art fair thou hast doves eyes behold thou art fair my beloved yea pleasant also our bed is green the beams of our house are cedar and our rafters of fir i am the rose of sharon and the lily of the valleys as the lily among thorns so is my love among the daughters as the apple tree among the trees of the wood so is my beloved among the sons i sat down under his shadow with great delight and his fruit was sweet to my taste he brought me to the banqueting house and his banner over me was love stay me with flagons comfort me with apples for i am sick of love his left hand is under my head and his right hand doth embrace me i charge you o ye daughters of jerusalem by the roes and by the hinds of the field that ye stir not up nor awake my love till he please the voice of my beloved behold he cometh leaping upon the mountains skipping upon the hills my beloved is like a roe or a young hart behold he standeth behind our wall he looketh forth at the windows shewing himself through the lattice my beloved spake and said unto me rise up my love my fair one and come away for lo the winter is past the rain is over and gone the flowers appear on the earth the time of the singing of birds is come and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land the fig tree putteth forth her green figs and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell arise my love my fair one and come away o my dove that art in the clefts
