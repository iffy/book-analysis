house for a great while to come and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree o lord god what can david speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant for thou knowest thy servant o lord for thy servants sake and according to thine own heart hast thou done all this greatness in making known all these great things o lord there is none like thee neither is there any god beside thee according to all that we have heard with our ears and what one nation in the earth is like thy people israel whom god went to redeem to be his own people to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness by driving out nations from before thy people whom thou hast redeemed out of egypt for thy people israel didst thou make thine own people for ever and thou lord becamest their god therefore now lord let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever and do as thou hast said let it even be established that thy name may be magnified for ever saying the lord of hosts is the god of israel even a god to israel and let the house of david thy servant be established before thee for thou o my god hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee and now lord thou art god and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant that it may be before thee for ever for thou blessest o lord and it shall be blessed for ever now after this it came to pass that david smote the philistines and subdued them and took gath and her towns out of the hand of the philistines and he smote moab and the moabites became davids servants and brought gifts and david smote hadarezer king of zobah unto hamath as he went to stablish his dominion by the river euphrates and david took from him a thousand chariots and seven thousand horsemen and twenty thousand footmen david also houghed all the chariot horses but reserved of them an hundred chariots and when the syrians of damascus came to help hadarezer king of zobah david slew of the syrians two and twenty thousand men then david put garrisons in syriadamascus and the syrians became davids servants and brought gifts thus the lord preserved david whithersoever he went and david took the shields of gold that were on the servants of hadarezer and brought them to jerusalem likewise from tibhath and from chun cities of hadarezer brought david very much brass wherewith solomon made the brasen sea and the pillars and the vessels of brass now when tou king of hamath heard how david had smitten all the host of hadarezer king of zobah he sent hadoram his son to king david to enquire of his welfare and to congratulate him because he had fought against hadarezer and smitten him for hadarezer had war with tou and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass them also king david dedicated unto the lord with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations from edom and from moab and from the children of ammon and from the philistines and from amalek moreover abishai the son of zeruiah slew of the edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand and he put garrisons in edom and all the edomites became davids servants thus the lord preserved david whithersoever he went so david reigned over all israel and executed judgment and justice among all his people and joab the son of zeruiah was over the host and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud recorder and zadok the son of ahitub and abimelech the son of abiathar were the priests and shavsha was scribe and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the cherethites and the pelethites and the sons of david were chief about the king now it came to pass after this that nahash the king of the children of ammon died and his son reigned in his stead and david said i will shew kindness unto hanun the son of nahash because his father shewed kindness to me and david sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father so the servants of david came into the land of the children of ammon to hanun to comfort him but the princes of the children of ammon said to hanun thinkest thou that david doth honour thy father that he hath sent comforters unto thee are not his servants come unto thee for to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land wherefore hanun took davids servants and shaved them and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks and sent them away then there went certain and told david how the men were served and he sent to meet them for the men were greatly ashamed and the king said tarry at jericho until your beards be grown and then return and when the children of ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to david hanun and the children of ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of mesopotamia and out of syriamaachah and out of zobah so they hired thirty and two thousand chariots and the king of maachah and his people who came and pitched before medeba and the children of ammon gathered themselves together from their cities and came to battle and when david heard of it he sent joab and all the host of the mighty men and the children of ammon came out and put the battle in array before the gate of the city and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field now when joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind he chose out of all the choice of israel and put them in array against the syrians and the rest of the people he
