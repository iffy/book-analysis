death and the men answered her our life for yours if ye utter not this our business and it shall be when the lord hath given us the land that we will deal kindly and truly with thee then she let them down by a cord through the window for her house was upon the town wall and she dwelt upon the wall and she said unto them get you to the mountain lest the pursuers meet you and hide yourselves there three days until the pursuers be returned and afterward may ye go your way and the men said unto her we will be blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear behold when we come into the land thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by and thou shalt bring thy father and thy mother and thy brethren and all thy fathers household home unto thee and it shall be that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street his blood shall be upon his head and we will be guiltless and whosoever shall be with thee in the house his blood shall be on our head if any hand be upon him and if thou utter this our business then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear and she said according unto your words so be it and she sent them away and they departed and she bound the scarlet line in the window and they went and came unto the mountain and abode there three days until the pursuers were returned and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way but found them not so the two men returned and descended from the mountain and passed over and came to joshua the son of nun and told him all things that befell them and they said unto joshua truly the lord hath delivered into our hands all the land for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us and joshua rose early in the morning and they removed from shittim and came to jordan he and all the children of israel and lodged there before they passed over and it came to pass after three days that the officers went through the host and they commanded the people saying when ye see the ark of the covenant of the lord your god and the priests the levites bearing it then ye shall remove from your place and go after it yet there shall be a space between you and it about two thousand cubits by measure come not near unto it that ye may know the way by which ye must go for ye have not passed this way heretofore and joshua said unto the people sanctify yourselves for to morrow the lord will do wonders among you and joshua spake unto the priests saying take up the ark of the covenant and pass over before the people and they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people and the lord said unto joshua this day will i begin to magnify thee in the sight of all israel that they may know that as i was with moses so i will be with thee and thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant saying when ye are come to the brink of the water of jordan ye shall stand still in jordan and joshua said unto the children of israel come hither and hear the words of the lord your god and joshua said hereby ye shall know that the living god is among you and that he will without fail drive out from before you the canaanites and the hittites and the hivites and the perizzites and the girgashites and the amorites and the jebusites behold the ark of the covenant of the lord of all the earth passeth over before you into jordan now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of israel out of every tribe a man and it shall come to pass as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the

the lord your god into the midst of jordan and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder according unto the number of the tribes of the children of israel that this may
