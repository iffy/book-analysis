unto you because they have not known the father nor me but these things have i told you that when the time shall come ye may remember that i told you of them and these things i said not unto you at the beginning because i was with you but now i go my way to him that sent me and none of you asketh me whither goest thou but because i have said these things unto you sorrow hath filled your heart nevertheless i tell you the truth it is expedient for you that i go away for if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if i depart i will send him unto you and when he is come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment of sin because they believe not on me of righteousness because i go to my father and ye see me no more of judgment because the prince of this world is judged i have yet many things to say unto you but ye cannot bear them now howbeit when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will shew you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall shew it unto you all things that the father hath are mine therefore said i that he shall take of mine and shall shew it unto you a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me because i go to the father then said some of his disciples among themselves what is this that he saith unto us a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me and because i go to the father they said therefore what is this that he saith a little while we cannot tell what he saith now jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him and said unto them do ye enquire among yourselves of that i said a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me verily verily i say unto you that ye shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into joy a woman when she is in travail hath sorrow because her hour is come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remembereth no more the anguish for joy that a man is born into the world and ye now therefore have sorrow but i will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you and in that day ye shall ask me nothing verily verily i say unto you whatsoever ye shall ask the father in my name he will give it you hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name ask and ye shall receive that your joy may be full these things have i spoken unto you in proverbs but the time cometh when i shall no more speak unto you in proverbs but i shall shew you plainly of the father at that day ye shall ask in my name and i say not unto you that i will pray the father for you for the father himself loveth you because ye have loved me and have believed that i came out from god i came forth from the father and am come into the world again i leave the world and go to the father his disciples said unto him lo now speakest thou plainly and speakest no proverb now are we sure that thou knowest all things and needest not that any man should ask thee by this we believe that thou camest forth from god jesus answered them do ye now believe behold the hour cometh yea is now come that ye shall be scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone and yet i am not alone because the father is with me these things i have spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace in the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world these words spake jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify thee as thou hast given him power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him and this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent i have glorified thee on the earth i have finished the work which thou gavest me to do and now o father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which i had with thee before the world was i have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world thine they were and thou gavest them me and they have kept thy word now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee for i have given unto them the words which thou gavest me and they have received them and have known surely that i came out from thee and they have believed that thou didst send me i pray for them i pray not for the world but for them which thou hast given me for they are thine and all mine are thine and thine are mine and i am glorified in them and now i am no more in the world but these are in the world and i come to thee holy father keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me that they may be one as we are while i was with them in the world i kept them in thy name those that thou gavest me i have kept and none of them is lost but the son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled and now come i to thee and these things i
