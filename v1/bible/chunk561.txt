great day of the lord is near it is near and hasteth greatly even the voice of the day of the lord the mighty man shall cry there bitterly that day is a day of wrath a day of trouble and distress a day of wasteness and desolation a day of darkness and gloominess a day of clouds and thick darkness a day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities and against the high towers and i will bring distress upon men that they shall walk like blind men because they have sinned against the lord and their blood shall be poured out as dust and their flesh as the dung neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the lords wrath but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land gather yourselves together yea gather together o nation not desired before the decree bring forth before the day pass as the chaff before the fierce anger of the lord come upon you before the day of the lords anger come upon you seek ye the lord all ye meek of the earth which have wrought his judgment seek righteousness seek meekness it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the lords anger for gaza shall be forsaken and ashkelon a desolation they shall drive out ashdod at the noon day and ekron shall be rooted up woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast the nation of the cherethites the word of the lord is against you o canaan the land of the philistines i will even destroy thee that there shall be no inhabitant and the sea coast shall be dwellings and cottages for shepherds and folds for flocks and the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of judah they shall feed thereupon in the houses of ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening for the lord their god shall visit them and turn away their captivity i have heard the reproach of moab and the revilings of the children of ammon whereby they have reproached my people and magnified themselves against their border therefore as i live saith the lord of hosts the god of israel surely moab shall be as sodom and the children of ammon as gomorrah even the breeding of nettles and saltpits and a perpetual desolation the residue of my people shall spoil them and the remnant of my people shall possess them this shall they have for their pride because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of the lord of hosts the lord will be terrible unto them for he will famish all the gods of the earth and men shall worship him every one from his place even all the isles of the heathen ye ethiopians also ye shall be slain by my sword and he will stretch out his hand against the north and destroy assyria and will make nineveh a desolation and dry like a wilderness and flocks shall lie down in the midst of her all the beasts of the nations both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it their voice shall sing in the windows desolation shall be in the thresholds for he shall uncover the cedar work this is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly that said in her heart i am and there is none beside me how is she become a desolation a place for beasts to lie down in every one that passeth by her shall hiss and wag his hand woe to her that is filthy and polluted to the oppressing city she obeyed not the voice she received not correction she trusted not in the lord she drew not near to her god her princes within her are roaring lions her judges are evening wolves they gnaw not the bones till the morrow her prophets are light and treacherous persons her priests have polluted the sanctuary they have done violence to the law the just lord is in the midst thereof he will not do iniquity every morning doth he bring his judgment to light he faileth not but the unjust knoweth no shame i have cut off the nations their towers are desolate i made their streets waste that none passeth by their cities are destroyed so that there is no man that there is none inhabitant i said surely thou wilt fear me thou wilt receive instruction so their dwelling should not be cut off howsoever i punished them but they rose early and corrupted all their doings therefore wait ye upon me saith the lord until the day that i rise up to the prey for my determination is to gather the nations that i may assemble the kingdoms to pour upon them mine indignation even all my fierce anger for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy for then will i turn to the people a pure language that they may all call upon the name of the lord to serve him with one consent from beyond the rivers of ethiopia my suppliants even the daughter of my dispersed shall bring mine offering in that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings wherein thou hast transgressed against me for then i will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain i will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people and they shall trust in the name of the lord the remnant of israel shall not do iniquity nor speak lies neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth for they shall feed and lie down and none shall make them afraid sing o daughter of zion shout o israel be glad and rejoice with all the heart o daughter of jerusalem the lord hath taken away thy judgments he hath cast out thine enemy the king of israel even the lord is in the midst of thee thou shalt not see evil any more in that day it shall be said to jerusalem fear thou not
