bread from heaven for their hunger and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them but they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their necks and hearkened not to thy commandments and refused to obey neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them but hardened their necks and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage but thou art a god ready to pardon gracious and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and forsookest them not yea when they had made them a molten calf and said this is thy god that brought thee up out of egypt and had wrought great provocations yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day to lead them in the way neither the pillar of fire by night to shew them light and the way wherein they should go thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth and gavest them water for their thirst yea forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness so that they lacked nothing their clothes waxed not old and their feet swelled not moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations and didst divide them into corners so they possessed the land of sihon and the land of the king of heshbon and the land of og king of bashan their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven and broughtest them into the land concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers that they should go in to possess it so the children went in and possessed the land and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land the canaanites and gavest them into their hands with their kings and the people of the land that they might do with them as they would and they took strong cities and a fat land and possessed houses full of all goods wells digged vineyards and oliveyards and fruit trees in abundance so they did eat and were filled and became fat and delighted themselves in thy great goodness nevertheless they were disobedient and rebelled against thee and cast thy law behind their backs and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee and they wrought great provocations therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies who vexed them and in the time of their trouble when they cried unto thee thou heardest them from heaven and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours who saved them out of the hand of their enemies but after they had rest they did evil again before thee therefore leftest thou them in the land of their enemies so that they had the dominion over them yet when they returned and cried unto thee thou heardest them from heaven and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies and testifiedst against them that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law yet they dealt proudly and hearkened not unto thy commandments but sinned against thy judgments which if a man do he shall live in them and withdrew the shoulder and hardened their neck and would not hear yet many years didst thou forbear them and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets yet would they not give ear therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands nevertheless for thy great mercies sake thou didst not utterly consume them nor forsake them for thou art a gracious and merciful god now therefore our god the great the mighty and the terrible god who keepest covenant and mercy let not all the trouble seem little before thee that hath come upon us on our kings on our princes and on our priests and on our prophets and on our fathers and on all thy people since the time of the kings of assyria unto this day howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us for thou hast done right but we have done wickedly neither have our kings our princes our priests nor our fathers kept thy law nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies wherewith thou didst testify against them for they have not served thee in their kingdom and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them neither turned they from their wicked works behold we are servants this day and for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof behold we are servants in it and it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins also they have dominion over our bodies and over our cattle at their pleasure and we are in great distress and because of all this we make a sure covenant and write it and our princes levites and priests seal unto it now those that sealed were nehemiah the tirshatha the son of hachaliah and zidkijah seraiah azariah jeremiah pashur amariah malchijah hattush shebaniah malluch harim meremoth obadiah
