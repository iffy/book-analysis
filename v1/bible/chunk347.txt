the stones of the brooks yea the almighty shall be thy defence and thou shalt have plenty of silver for then shalt thou have thy delight in the almighty and shalt lift up thy face unto god thou shalt make thy prayer unto him and he shall hear thee and thou shalt pay thy vows thou shalt also decree a thing and it shall be established unto thee and the light shall shine upon thy ways when men are cast down then thou shalt say there is lifting up and he shall save the humble person he shall deliver the island of the innocent and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands then job answered and said even to day is my complaint bitter my stroke is heavier than my groaning oh that i knew where i might find him that i might come even to his seat i would order my cause before him and fill my mouth with arguments i would know the words which he would answer me and understand what he would say unto me will he plead against me with his great power no but he would put strength in me there the righteous might dispute with him so should i be delivered for ever from my judge behold i go forward but he is not there and backward but i cannot perceive him on the left hand where he doth work but i cannot behold him he hideth himself on the right hand that i cannot see him but he knoweth the way that i take when he hath tried me i shall come forth as gold my foot hath held his steps his way have i kept and not declined neither have i gone back from the commandment of his lips i have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food but he is in one mind and who can turn him and what his soul desireth even that he doeth for he performeth the thing that is appointed for me and many such things are with him therefore am i troubled at his presence when i consider i am afraid of him for god maketh my heart soft and the almighty troubleth me because i was not cut off before the darkness neither hath he covered the darkness from my face why seeing times are not hidden from the almighty do they that know him not see his days some remove the landmarks they violently take away flocks and feed thereof they drive away the ass of the fatherless they take the widows ox for a pledge they turn the needy out of the way the poor of the earth hide themselves together behold as wild asses in the desert go they forth to their work rising betimes for a prey the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children they reap every one his corn in the field and they gather the vintage of the wicked they cause the naked to lodge without clothing that they have no covering in the cold they are wet with the showers of the mountains and embrace the rock for want of a shelter they pluck the fatherless from the breast and take a pledge of the poor they cause him to go naked without clothing and they take away the sheaf from the hungry which make oil within their walls and tread their winepresses and suffer thirst men groan from out of the city and the soul of the wounded crieth out yet god layeth not folly to them they are of those that rebel against the light they know not the ways thereof nor abide in the paths thereof the murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy and in the night is as a thief the eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight saying no eye shall see me and disguiseth his face in the dark they dig through houses which they had marked for themselves in the daytime they know not the light for the morning is to them even as the shadow of death if one know them they are in the terrors of the shadow of death he is swift as the waters their portion is cursed in the earth he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards drought and heat consume the snow waters so doth the grave those which have sinned the womb shall forget him the worm shall feed sweetly on him he shall be no more remembered and wickedness shall be broken as a tree he evil entreateth the barren that beareth not and doeth not good to the widow he draweth also the mighty with his power he riseth up and no man is sure of life though it be given him to be in safety whereon he resteth yet his eyes are upon their ways they are exalted for a little while but are gone and brought low they are taken out of the way as all other and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn and if it be not so now who will make me a liar and make my speech nothing worth then answered bildad the shuhite and said dominion and fear are with him he maketh peace in his high places is there any number of his armies and upon whom doth not his light arise how then can man be justified with god or how can he be clean that is born of a woman behold even to the moon and it shineth not yea the stars are not pure in his sight how much less man that is a worm and the son of man which is a worm but job answered and said how hast thou helped him that is without power how savest thou the arm that hath no strength how hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is to whom hast thou uttered words and whose spirit came from thee dead things are formed from under the waters and the inhabitants thereof hell is naked before him and destruction hath no covering he stretcheth out the north over the empty place and hangeth the earth upon nothing he bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds and the
