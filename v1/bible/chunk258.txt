said it is false tell us now and he said thus and thus spake he to me saying thus saith the lord i have anointed thee king over israel then they hasted and took every man his garment and put it under him on the top of the stairs and blew with trumpets saying jehu is king so jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi conspired against joram now joram had kept ramothgilead he and all israel because of hazael king of syria but king joram was returned to be healed in jezreel of the wounds which the syrians had given him when he fought with hazael king of syria and jehu said if it be your minds then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in jezreel so jehu rode in a chariot and went to jezreel for joram lay there and ahaziah king of judah was come down to see joram and there stood a watchman on the tower in jezreel and he spied the company of jehu as he came and said i see a company and joram said take an horseman and send to meet them and let him say is it peace so there went one on horseback to meet him and said thus saith the king is it peace and jehu said what hast thou to do with peace turn thee behind me and the watchman told saying the messenger came to them but he cometh not again then he sent out a second on horseback which came to them and said thus saith the king is it peace and jehu answered what hast thou to do with peace turn thee behind me and the watchman told saying he came even unto them and cometh not again and the driving is like the driving of jehu the son of nimshi for he driveth furiously and joram said make ready and his chariot was made ready and joram king of israel and ahaziah king of judah went out each in his chariot and they went out against jehu and met him in the portion of naboth the jezreelite and it came to pass when joram saw jehu that he said is it peace jehu and he answered what peace so long as the whoredoms of thy mother jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many and joram turned his hands and fled and said to ahaziah there is treachery o ahaziah and jehu drew a bow with his full strength and smote jehoram between his arms and the arrow went out at his heart and he sunk down in his chariot then said jehu to bidkar his captain take up and cast him in the portion of the field of naboth the jezreelite for remember how that when i and thou rode together after ahab his father the lord laid this burden upon him surely i have seen yesterday the blood of naboth and the blood of his sons saith the lord and i will requite thee in this plat saith the lord now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground according to the word of the lord but when ahaziah the king of judah saw this he fled by the way of the garden house and jehu followed after him and said smite him also in the chariot and they did so at the going up to gur which is by ibleam and he fled to megiddo and died there and his servants carried him in a chariot to jerusalem and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of david and in the eleventh year of joram the son of ahab began ahaziah to reign over judah and when jehu was come to jezreel jezebel heard of it and she painted her face and tired her head and looked out at a window and as jehu entered in at the gate she said had zimri peace who slew his master and he lifted up his face to the window and said who is on my side who and there looked out to him two or three eunuchs and he said throw her down so they threw her down and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the horses and he trode her under foot and when he was come in he did eat and drink and said go see now this cursed woman and bury her for she is a kings daughter and they went to bury her but they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands wherefore they came again and told him and he said this is the word of the lord which he spake by his servant elijah the tishbite saying in the portion of jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of jezebel and the carcase of jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of jezreel so that they shall not say this is jezebel and ahab had seventy sons in samaria and jehu wrote letters and sent to samaria unto the rulers of jezreel to the elders and to them that brought up ahabs children saying now as soon as this letter cometh to you seeing your masters sons are with you and there are with you chariots and horses a fenced city also and armour look even out the best and meetest of your masters sons and set him on his fathers throne and fight for your masters house but they were exceedingly afraid and said behold two kings stood not before him how then shall we stand and he that was over the house and he that was over the city the elders also and the bringers up of the children sent to jehu saying we are thy servants and will do all that thou shalt bid us we will not make any king do thou that which is good in thine eyes then he wrote a letter the second time to them saying if ye be mine and if ye will hearken unto my voice take ye the heads of the men your masters sons and come to me to jezreel by to morrow this time now the kings sons being seventy persons were with the great men
