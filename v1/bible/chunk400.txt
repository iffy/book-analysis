desireth the net of evil men but the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit the wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips but the just shall come out of trouble a man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth and the recompence of a mans hands shall be rendered unto him the way of a fool is right in his own eyes but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise a fools wrath is presently known but a prudent man covereth shame he that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness but a false witness deceit there is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword but the tongue of the wise is health the lip of truth shall be established for ever but a lying tongue is but for a moment deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil but to the counsellors of peace is joy there shall no evil happen to the just but the wicked shall be filled with mischief lying lips are abomination to the lord but they that deal truly are his delight a prudent man concealeth knowledge but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness the hand of the diligent shall bear rule but the slothful shall be under tribute heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop but a good word maketh it glad the righteous is more excellent than his neighbour but the way of the wicked seduceth them the slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting but the substance of a diligent man is precious in the way of righteousness is life and in the pathway thereof there is no death a wise son heareth his fathers instruction but a scorner heareth not rebuke a man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth but the soul of the transgressors shall eat violence he that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life but he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction the soul of the sluggard desireth and hath nothing but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat a righteous man hateth lying but a wicked man is loathsome and cometh to shame righteousness keepeth him that is upright in the way but wickedness overthroweth the sinner there is that maketh himself rich yet hath nothing there is that maketh himself poor yet hath great riches the ransom of a mans life are his riches but the poor heareth not rebuke the light of the righteous rejoiceth but the lamp of the wicked shall be put out only by pride cometh contention but with the well advised is wisdom wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished but he that gathereth by labour shall increase hope deferred maketh the heart sick but when the desire cometh it is a tree of life whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded the law of the wise is a fountain of life to depart from the snares of death good understanding giveth favour but the way of transgressors is hard every prudent man dealeth with knowledge but a fool layeth open his folly a wicked messenger falleth into mischief but a faithful ambassador is health poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured the desire accomplished is sweet to the soul but it is abomination to fools to depart from evil he that walketh with wise men shall be wise but a companion of fools shall be destroyed evil pursueth sinners but to the righteous good shall be repayed a good man leaveth an inheritance to his childrens children and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just much food is in the tillage of the poor but there is that is destroyed for want of judgment he that spareth his rod hateth his son but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes the righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul but the belly of the wicked shall want every wise woman buildeth her house but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands he that walketh in his uprightness feareth the lord but he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him in the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride but the lips of the wise shall preserve them where no oxen are the crib is clean but much increase is by the strength of the ox a faithful witness will not lie but a false witness will utter lies a scorner seeketh wisdom and findeth it not but knowledge is easy unto him that understandeth go from the presence of a foolish man when thou perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge the wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way but the folly of fools is deceit fools make a mock at sin but among the righteous there is favour the heart knoweth his own bitterness and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy the house of the wicked shall be overthrown but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish there is a way which seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death even in laughter the heart is sorrowful and the end of that mirth is heaviness the backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways and a good man shall be satisfied from himself the simple believeth every word but the prudent man looketh well to his going a wise man feareth and departeth from evil but the fool rageth and is confident he that is soon angry dealeth foolishly and a man of wicked devices is hated the simple inherit folly but the prudent are crowned with knowledge the evil bow before the good and the wicked at the gates of the righteous the poor is hated even of his own neighbour but the rich hath many friends he that despiseth his neighbour sinneth but he that hath mercy on the poor happy is he do they not err that devise evil but mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good in all labour there is profit but the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury the crown of the wise is their riches but the foolishness of fools is folly a true witness
