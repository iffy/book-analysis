valley of jehoshaphat for there will i sit to judge all the heathen round about put ye in the sickle for the harvest is ripe come get you down for the press is full the fats overflow for their wickedness is great multitudes multitudes in the valley of decision for the day of the lord is near in the valley of decision the sun and the moon shall be darkened and the stars shall withdraw their shining the lord also shall roar out of zion and utter his voice from jerusalem and the heavens and the earth shall shake but the lord will be the hope of his people and the strength of the children of israel so shall ye know that i am the lord your god dwelling in zion my holy mountain then shall jerusalem be holy and there shall no strangers pass through her any more and it shall come to pass in that day that the mountains shall drop down new wine and the hills shall flow with milk and all the rivers of judah shall flow with waters and a fountain shall come forth out of the house of the lord and shall water the valley of shittim egypt shall be a desolation and edom shall be a desolate wilderness for the violence against the children of judah because they have shed innocent blood in their land but judah shall dwell for ever and jerusalem from generation to generation for i will cleanse their blood that i have not cleansed for the lord dwelleth in zion amos the words of amos who was among the herdmen of tekoa which he saw concerning israel in the days of uzziah king of judah and in the days of jeroboam the son of joash king of israel two years before the earthquake and he said the lord will roar from zion and utter his voice from jerusalem and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn and the top of carmel shall wither thus saith the lord for three transgressions of damascus and for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because they have threshed gilead with threshing instruments of iron but i will send a fire into the house of hazael which shall devour the palaces of benhadad i will break also the bar of damascus and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of aven and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of eden and the people of syria shall go into captivity unto kir saith the lord thus saith the lord for three transgressions of gaza and for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because they carried away captive the whole captivity to deliver them up to edom but i will send a fire on the wall of gaza which shall devour the palaces thereof and i will cut off the inhabitant from ashdod and him that holdeth the sceptre from ashkelon and i will turn mine hand against ekron and the remnant of the philistines shall perish saith the lord god thus saith the lord for three transgressions of tyrus and for four i

pity and his anger did tear perpetually and he kept his wrath for ever but i will send a fire upon teman which shall devour the palaces of bozrah thus saith the lord for three transgressions of the children of ammon and for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because they have ripped up the women with child of gilead that they might enlarge their border but i will kindle a fire in

together saith the lord thus saith the lord for three transgressions of moab and for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because he burned the bones of the king of edom into lime but i
