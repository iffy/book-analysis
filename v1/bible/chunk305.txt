the kings house and a third part at the gate of the foundation and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the lord but let none come into the house of the lord save the priests and they that minister of the levites they shall go in for they are holy but all the people shall keep the watch of the lord and the levites shall compass the king round about every man with his weapons in his hand and whosoever else cometh into the house he shall be put to death but be ye with the king when he cometh in and when he goeth out so the levites and all judah did according to all things that jehoiada the priest had commanded and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath with them that were to go out on the sabbath for jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses moreover jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears and bucklers and shields that had been king davids which were in the house of god and he set all the people every man having his weapon in his hand from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple along by the altar and the temple by the king round about then they brought out the kings son and put upon him the crown and gave him the testimony and made him king and jehoiada and his sons anointed him and said god save the king now when athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king she came to the people into the house of the lord and she looked and behold the king stood at his pillar at the entering in and the princes and the trumpets by the king and all the people of the land rejoiced and sounded with trumpets also the singers with instruments of musick and such as taught to sing praise then athaliah rent her clothes and said treason treason then jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host and said unto them have her forth of the ranges and whoso followeth her let him be slain with the sword for the priest said slay her not in the house of the lord so they laid hands on her and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the kings house they slew her there and jehoiada made a covenant between him and between all the people and between the king that they should be the lords people then all the people went to the house of baal and brake it down and brake his altars and his images in pieces and slew mattan the priest of baal before the altars also jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the lord by the hand of the priests the levites whom david had distributed in the house of the lord to offer the burnt offerings of the lord as it is written in the law of moses with rejoicing and with singing as it was ordained by david and he set the porters at the gates of the house of the lord that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in and he took the captains of hundreds and the nobles and the governors of the people and all the people of the land and brought down the king from the house of the lord and they came through the high gate into the kings house and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom and all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet after that they had slain athaliah with the sword joash was seven years old when he began to reign and he reigned forty years in jerusalem his mothers name also was zibiah of beersheba and joash did that which was right in the sight of the lord all the days of jehoiada the priest and jehoiada took for him two wives and he begat sons and daughters and it came to pass after this that joash was minded to repair the house of the lord and he gathered together the priests and the levites and said to them go out unto the cities of judah and gather of all israel money to repair the house of your god from year to year and see that ye hasten the matter howbeit the levites hastened it not and the king called for jehoiada the chief and said unto him why hast thou not required of the levites to bring in out of judah and out of jerusalem the collection according to the commandment of moses the servant of the lord and of the congregation of israel for the tabernacle of witness for the sons of athaliah that wicked woman had broken up the house of god and also all the dedicated things of the house of the lord did they bestow upon baalim and at the kings commandment they made a chest and set it without at the gate of the house of the lord and they made a proclamation through judah and jerusalem to bring in to the lord the collection that moses the servant of god laid upon israel in the wilderness and all the princes and all the people rejoiced and brought in and cast into the chest until they had made an end now it came to pass that at what time the chest was brought unto the kings office by the hand of the levites and when they saw that there was much money the kings scribe and the high priests officer came and emptied the chest and took it and carried it to his place again thus they did day by day and gathered money in abundance and the king and jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the lord and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the lord and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the lord so the workmen wrought and the work was perfected by them and they set the house of god in his state and strengthened it and when they had finished
