not go into the land which the lord had given them and the lords anger was kindled the same time and he sware saying surely none of the men that came up out of egypt from twenty years old and upward shall see the land which i sware unto abraham unto isaac and unto jacob because they have not wholly followed me save caleb the son of jephunneh the kenezite and joshua the son of nun for they have wholly followed the lord and the lords anger was kindled against israel and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the lord was consumed and behold ye are risen up in your fathers stead an increase of sinful men to augment yet the fierce anger of the lord toward israel for if ye turn away from after him he will yet again leave them in the wilderness and ye shall destroy all this people and they came near unto him and said we will build sheepfolds here for our cattle and cities for our little ones but we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of israel until we have brought them unto their place and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land we will not return unto our houses until the children of israel have inherited every man his inheritance for we will not inherit with them on yonder side jordan or forward because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side jordan eastward and moses said unto them if ye will do this thing if ye will go armed before the lord to war and will go all of you armed over jordan before the lord until he hath driven out his enemies from before him and the land be subdued before the lord then afterward ye shall return and be guiltless before the lord and before israel and this land shall be your possession before the lord but if ye will not do so behold ye have sinned against the lord and be sure your sin will find you out build you cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth and the children of gad and the children of reuben spake unto moses saying thy servants will do as my lord commandeth our little ones our wives our flocks and all our cattle shall be there in the cities of gilead but thy servants will pass over every man armed for war before the lord to battle as my lord saith so concerning them moses commanded eleazar the priest and joshua the son of nun and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of israel and moses said unto them if the children of gad and the children of reuben will pass with you over jordan every man armed to battle before the lord and the land shall be subdued before you then ye shall give them the land of gilead for a possession but if they will not pass over with you armed they shall have possessions among you in the land of canaan and the children of gad and the children of reuben answered saying as the lord hath said unto thy servants so will we do we will pass over armed before the lord into the land of canaan that the possession of our inheritance on this side jordan may be ours and moses gave unto them even to the children of gad and to the children of reuben and unto half the tribe of manasseh the son of joseph the kingdom of sihon king of the amorites and the kingdom of og king of bashan the land with the cities thereof in the coasts even the cities of the country round about and the children of gad built dibon and ataroth and aroer and atroth shophan and jaazer and jogbehah and bethnimrah and bethharan fenced cities and folds for sheep and the children of reuben built heshbon and elealeh and kirjathaim and nebo and baalmeon their names being changed and shibmah and gave other names unto the cities which they builded and the children of machir the son of manasseh went to gilead and took it and dispossessed the amorite which was in it and moses gave gilead unto machir the son of manasseh and he dwelt therein and jair the son of manasseh went and took the small towns thereof and called them havothjair and nobah went and took kenath and the villages thereof and called it nobah after his own name these are the journeys of the children of israel which went forth out of the land of egypt with their armies under the hand of moses and aaron and moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the lord and these are their journeys according to their goings out and they departed from rameses in the first month on the fifteenth day of the first month on the morrow after the passover the children of israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the egyptians for the egyptians buried all their firstborn which the lord had smitten among them upon their gods also the lord executed judgments and the children of israel removed from rameses and pitched in succoth and they departed from succoth and pitched in etham which is in the edge of the wilderness and they removed from etham and turned again unto pihahiroth which is before baalzephon and they pitched before migdol and they departed from before pihahiroth and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness and went three days journey in the wilderness of etham and pitched in marah and they removed from marah and came unto elim and in elim were twelve fountains of water and threescore and ten palm trees and they pitched there and they removed from elim and encamped by the red sea and they removed from the red sea and encamped in the wilderness of sin and they took their journey out of the wilderness of sin and encamped in dophkah and they departed from dophkah and encamped in alush and they removed from alush and encamped at rephidim
