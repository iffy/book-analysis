house and in thy presence for thy name is in this house and cry unto thee in our affliction then thou wilt hear and help and now behold the children of ammon and moab and mount seir whom thou wouldest not let israel invade when they came out of the land of egypt but they turned from them and destroyed them not behold i say how they reward us to come to cast us out of thy possession which thou hast given us to inherit o our god wilt thou not judge them for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us neither know we what to do but our eyes are upon thee and all judah stood before the lord with their little ones their wives and their children then upon jahaziel the son of zechariah the son of benaiah the son of jeiel the son of mattaniah a levite of the sons of asaph came the spirit of the lord in the midst of the congregation and he said hearken ye all judah and ye inhabitants of jerusalem and thou king jehoshaphat thus saith the lord unto you be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but gods to morrow go ye down against them behold they come up by the cliff of ziz and ye shall find them at the end of the brook before the wilderness of jeruel ye shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand ye still and see the salvation of the lord with you o judah and jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed to morrow go out against them for the lord will be with you and jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground and all judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem fell before the lord worshipping the lord and the levites of the children of the kohathites and of the children of the korhites stood up to praise the lord god of israel with a loud voice on high and they rose early in the morning and went forth into the wilderness of tekoa and as they went forth jehoshaphat stood and said hear me o judah and ye inhabitants of jerusalem believe in the lord your god so shall ye be established believe his prophets so shall ye prosper and when he had consulted with the people he appointed singers unto the lord and that should praise the beauty of holiness as they went out before the army and to say praise the lord for his mercy endureth for ever and when they began to sing and to praise the lord set ambushments against the children of ammon moab and mount seir which were come against judah and they were smitten for the children of ammon and moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount seir utterly to slay and destroy them and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of seir every one helped to destroy another and when judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness they looked unto the multitude and behold they were dead bodies fallen to the earth and none escaped and when jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies and precious jewels which they stripped off for themselves more than they could carry away and they were three days in gathering of the spoil it was so much and on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of berachah for there they blessed the lord therefore the name of the same place was called the valley of berachah unto this day then they returned every man of judah and jerusalem and jehoshaphat in the forefront of them to go again to jerusalem with joy for the lord had made them to rejoice over their enemies and they came to jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the lord and the fear of god was on all the kingdoms of those countries when they had heard that the lord fought against the enemies of israel so the realm of jehoshaphat was quiet for his god gave him rest round about and jehoshaphat reigned over judah he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and five years in jerusalem and his mothers name was azubah the daughter of shilhi and he walked in the way of asa his father and departed not from it doing that which was right in the sight of the lord howbeit the high places were not taken away for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the god of their fathers now the rest of the acts of jehoshaphat first and last behold they are written in the book of jehu the son of hanani who is mentioned in the book of the kings of israel and after this did jehoshaphat king of judah join himself with ahaziah king of israel who did very wickedly and he joined himself with him to make ships to go to tarshish and they made the ships in eziongaber then eliezer the son of dodavah of mareshah prophesied against jehoshaphat saying because thou hast joined thyself with ahaziah the lord hath broken thy works and the ships were broken that they were not able to go to tarshish now jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david and jehoram his son reigned in his stead and he had brethren the sons of jehoshaphat azariah and jehiel and zechariah and azariah and michael and shephatiah all these were the sons of jehoshaphat king of israel and their father gave them great gifts of silver and of gold and of precious things with fenced cities in judah but the kingdom gave he to jehoram because he was the firstborn now when jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father he strengthened himself and slew all his brethren with the sword and divers also of the princes of israel jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign and he reigned eight years in jerusalem and he walked in the way of the kings of israel like
