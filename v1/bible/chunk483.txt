all the jews which dwell in the land of egypt which dwell at migdol and at tahpanhes and at noph and in the country of pathros saying thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel ye have seen all the evil that i have brought upon jerusalem and upon all the cities of judah and behold this day they are a desolation and no man dwelleth therein because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger in that they went to burn incense and to serve other gods whom they knew not neither they ye nor your fathers howbeit i sent unto you all my servants the prophets rising early and sending them saying oh do not this abominable thing that i hate but they hearkened not nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness to burn no incense unto other gods wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth and was kindled in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem and they are wasted and desolate as at this day therefore now thus saith the lord the god of hosts the god of israel wherefore commit ye this great evil against your souls to cut off from you man and woman child and suckling out of judah to leave you none to remain in that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands burning incense unto other gods in the land of egypt whither ye be gone to dwell that ye might cut yourselves off and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers and the wickedness of the kings of judah and the wickedness of their wives and your own wickedness and the wickedness of your wives which they have committed in the land of judah and in the streets of jerusalem they are not humbled even unto this day neither have they feared nor walked in my law nor in my statutes that i set before you and before your fathers therefore thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will set my face against you for evil and to cut off all judah and i will take the remnant of judah that have set their faces to go into the land of egypt to sojourn there and they shall all be consumed and fall in the land of egypt they shall even be consumed by the sword and by the famine they shall die from the least even unto the greatest by the sword and by the famine and they shall be an execration and an astonishment and a curse and a reproach for i will punish them that dwell in the land of egypt as i have punished jerusalem by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence so that none of the remnant of judah which are gone into the land of egypt to sojourn there shall escape or remain that they should return into the land of judah to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there for none shall return but such as shall escape then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods and all the women that stood by a great multitude even all the people that dwelt in the land of egypt in pathros answered jeremiah saying as for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the lord we will not hearken unto thee but we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth to burn incense unto the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto her as we have done we and our fathers our kings and our princes in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem for then had we plenty of victuals and were well and saw no evil but since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto her we have wanted all things and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine and when we burned incense to the queen of heaven and poured out drink offerings unto her did we make her cakes to worship her and pour out drink offerings unto her without our men then jeremiah said unto all the people to the men and to the women and to all the people which had given him that answer saying the incense that ye burned in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem ye and your fathers your kings and your princes and the people of the land did not the lord remember them and came it not into his mind so that the lord could no longer bear because of the evil of your doings and because of the abominations which ye have committed therefore is your land a desolation and an astonishment and a curse without an inhabitant as at this day because ye have burned incense and because ye have sinned against the lord and have not obeyed the voice of the lord nor walked in his law nor in his statutes nor in his testimonies therefore this evil is happened unto you as at this day moreover jeremiah said unto all the people and to all the women hear the word of the lord all judah that are in the land of egypt thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel saying ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths and fulfilled with your hand saying we will surely perform our vows that we have vowed to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto her ye will surely accomplish your vows and surely perform your vows therefore hear ye the word of the lord all judah that dwell in the land of egypt behold i have sworn by my great name saith the lord that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of judah in all the land of egypt saying the lord god liveth behold i will watch over them for evil and not for good and all the men of judah that
