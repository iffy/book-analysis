trusted in falsehood therefore will i discover thy skirts upon thy face that thy shame may appear i have seen thine adulteries and thy neighings the lewdness of thy whoredom and thine abominations on the hills in the fields woe unto thee o jerusalem wilt thou not be made clean when shall it once be the word of the lord that came to jeremiah concerning the dearth judah mourneth and the gates thereof languish they are black unto the ground and the cry of jerusalem is gone up and their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters they came to the pits and found no water they returned with their vessels empty they were ashamed and confounded and covered their heads because the ground is chapt for there was no rain in the earth the plowmen were ashamed they covered their heads yea the hind also calved in the field and forsook it because there was no grass and the wild asses did stand in the high places they snuffed up the wind like dragons their eyes did fail because there was no grass o lord though our iniquities testify against us do thou it for thy names sake for our backslidings are many we have sinned against thee o the hope of israel the saviour thereof in time of trouble why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night why shouldest thou be as a man astonied as a mighty man that cannot save yet thou o lord art in the midst of us and we are called by thy name leave us not thus saith the lord unto this people thus have they loved to wander they have not refrained their feet therefore the lord doth not accept them he will now remember their iniquity and visit their sins then said the lord unto me pray not for this people for their good when they fast i will not hear their cry and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation i will not accept them but i will consume them by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence then said i ah lord god behold the prophets say unto them ye shall not see the sword neither shall ye have famine but i will give you assured peace in this place then the lord said unto me the prophets prophesy lies in my name i sent them not neither have i commanded them neither spake unto them they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination and a thing of nought and the deceit of their heart therefore thus saith the lord concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name and i sent them not yet they say sword and famine shall not be in this land by sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed and the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of jerusalem because of the famine and the sword and they shall have none to bury them them their wives nor their sons nor their daughters for i will pour their wickedness upon them therefore thou shalt say this word unto them let mine eyes run down with tears night and day and let them not cease for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach with a very grievous blow if i go forth into the field then behold the slain with the sword and if i enter into the city then behold them that are sick with famine yea both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not hast thou utterly rejected judah hath thy soul lothed zion why hast thou smitten us and there is no healing for us we looked for peace and there is no good and for the time of healing and behold trouble we acknowledge o lord our wickedness and the iniquity of our fathers for we have sinned against thee do not abhor us for thy names sake do not disgrace the throne of thy glory remember break not thy covenant with us are there any among the vanities of the gentiles that can cause rain or can the heavens give showers art not thou he o lord our god therefore we will wait upon thee for thou hast made all these things then said the lord unto me though moses and samuel stood before me yet my mind could not be toward this people cast them out of my sight and let them go forth and it shall come to pass if they say unto thee whither shall we go forth then thou shalt tell them thus saith the lord such as are for death to death and such as are for the sword to the sword and such as are for the famine to the famine and such as are for the captivity to the captivity and i will appoint over them four kinds saith the lord the sword to slay and the dogs to tear and the fowls of the heaven and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy and i will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth because of manasseh the son of hezekiah king of judah for that which he did in jerusalem for who shall have pity upon thee o jerusalem or who shall bemoan thee or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest thou hast forsaken me saith the lord thou art gone backward therefore will i stretch out my hand against thee and destroy thee i am weary with repenting and i will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land i will bereave them of children i will destroy my people since they return not from their ways their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas i have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday i have caused him to fall upon it suddenly and terrors upon the city she that hath borne seven languisheth she hath given up the ghost her sun is gone down while it was yet day she hath been ashamed and confounded and the residue of them will i deliver to
