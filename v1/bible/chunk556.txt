doings thus saith the lord concerning the prophets that make my people err that bite with their teeth and cry peace and he that putteth not into their mouths they even prepare war against him therefore night shall be unto you that ye shall not have a vision and it shall be dark unto you that ye shall not divine and the sun shall go down over the prophets and the day shall be dark over them then shall the seers be ashamed and the diviners confounded yea they shall all cover their lips for there is no answer of god but truly i am full of power by the spirit of the lord and of judgment and of might to declare unto jacob his transgression and to israel his sin hear this i pray you ye heads of the house of jacob and princes of the house of israel that abhor judgment and pervert all equity they build up zion with blood and jerusalem with iniquity the heads thereof judge for reward and the priests thereof teach for hire and the prophets thereof divine for money yet will they lean upon the lord and say is not the lord among us none evil can come upon us therefore shall zion for your sake be plowed as a field and jerusalem shall become heaps and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest but in the last days it shall come to pass that the mountain of the house of the lord shall be established in the top of the mountains and it shall be exalted above the hills and people shall flow unto it and many nations shall come and say come and let us go up to the mountain of the lord and to the house of the god of jacob and he will teach us of his ways and we will walk in his paths for the law shall go forth of zion and the word of the lord from jerusalem and he shall judge among many people and rebuke strong nations afar off and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruninghooks nation shall not lift up a sword against nation neither shall they learn war any more but they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree and none shall make them afraid for the mouth of the lord of hosts hath spoken it for all people will walk every one in the name of his god and we will walk in the name of the lord our god for ever and ever in that day saith the lord will i assemble her that halteth and i will gather her that is driven out and her that i have afflicted and i will make her that halted a remnant and her that was cast far off a strong nation and the lord shall reign over them in mount zion from henceforth even for ever and thou o tower of the flock the strong hold of the daughter of zion unto thee shall it come even the first dominion the kingdom shall come to the daughter of jerusalem now why dost thou cry out aloud is there no king in thee is thy counsellor perished for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail be in pain and labour to bring forth o daughter of zion like a woman in travail for now shalt thou go forth out of the city and thou shalt dwell in the field and thou shalt go even to babylon there shalt thou be delivered there the lord shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies now also many nations are gathered against thee that say let her be defiled and let our eye look upon zion but they know not the thoughts of the lord neither understand they his counsel for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor arise and thresh o daughter of zion for i will make thine horn iron and i will make thy hoofs brass and thou shalt beat in pieces many people and i will consecrate their gain unto the lord and their substance unto the lord of the whole earth now gather thyself in troops o daughter of troops he hath laid siege against us they shall smite the judge of israel with a rod upon the cheek but thou bethlehem ephratah though thou be little among the thousands of judah yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in israel whose goings forth have been from of old from everlasting therefore will he give them up until the time that she which travaileth hath brought forth then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of israel and he shall stand and feed in the strength of the lord in the majesty of the name of the lord his god and they shall abide for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth and this man shall be the peace when the assyrian shall come into our land and when he shall tread in our palaces then shall we raise against him seven shepherds and eight principal men and they shall waste the land of assyria with the sword and the land of nimrod in the entrances thereof thus shall he deliver us from the assyrian when he cometh into our land and when he treadeth within our borders and the remnant of jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the lord as the showers upon the grass that tarrieth not for man nor waiteth for the sons of men and the remnant of jacob shall be among the gentiles in the midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest as a young lion among the flocks of sheep who if he go through both treadeth down and teareth in pieces and none can deliver thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries and all thine enemies shall be cut off and it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord that i will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee and i will destroy thy chariots and i will cut off the cities of
