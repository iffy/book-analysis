unto him i have heard thy prayer and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice if i shut up heaven that there be no rain or if i command the locusts to devour the land or if i send pestilence among my people if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will i hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land now mine eyes shall be open and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place for now have i chosen and sanctified this house that my name may be there for ever and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually and as for thee if thou wilt walk before me as david thy father walked and do according to all that i have commanded thee and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments then will i stablish the throne of thy kingdom according as i have covenanted with david thy father saying there shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in israel but if ye turn away and forsake my statutes and my commandments which i have set before you and shall go and serve other gods and worship them then will i pluck them up by the roots out of my land which i have given them and this house which i have sanctified for my name will i cast out of my sight and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all nations and this house which is high shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it so that he shall say why hath the lord done thus unto this land and unto this house and it shall be answered because they forsook the lord god of their fathers which brought them forth out of the land of egypt and laid hold on other gods and worshipped them and served them therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them and it came to pass at the end of twenty years wherein solomon had built the house of the lord and his own house that the cities which huram had restored to solomon solomon built them and caused the children of israel to dwell there and solomon went to hamathzobah and prevailed against it and he built tadmor in the wilderness and all the store cities which he built in hamath also he built bethhoron the upper and bethhoron the nether fenced cities with walls gates and bars and baalath and all the store cities that solomon had and all the chariot cities and the cities of the horsemen and all that solomon desired to build in jerusalem and in lebanon and throughout all the land of his dominion as for all the people that were left of the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites which were not of israel but of their children who were left after them in the land whom the children of israel consumed not them did solomon make to pay tribute until this day but of the children of israel did solomon make no servants for his work but they were men of war and chief of his captains and captains of his chariots and horsemen and these were the chief of king solomons officers even two hundred and fifty that bare rule over the people and solomon brought up the daughter of pharaoh out of the city of david unto the house that he had built for her for he said my wife shall not dwell in the house of david king of israel because the places are holy whereunto the ark of the lord hath come then solomon offered burnt offerings unto the lord on the altar of the lord which he had built before the porch even after a certain rate every day offering according to the commandment of moses on the sabbaths and on the new moons and on the solemn feasts three times in the year even in the feast of unleavened bread and in the feast of weeks and in the feast of tabernacles and he appointed according to the order of david his father the courses of the priests to their service and the levites to their charges to praise and minister before the priests as the duty of every day required the porters also by their courses at every gate for so had david the man of god commanded and they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and levites concerning any matter or concerning the treasures now all the work of solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the lord and until it was finished so the house of the lord was perfected then went solomon to eziongeber and to eloth at the sea side in the land of edom and huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships and servants that had knowledge of the sea and they went with the servants of solomon to ophir and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold and brought them to king solomon and when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomon she came to prove solomon with hard questions at jerusalem with a very great company and camels that bare spices and gold in abundance and precious stones and when she was come to solomon she communed with him of all that was in her heart and solomon told her all her questions and there was nothing hid from solomon which he told her not and when the queen of sheba had seen the wisdom of solomon and the house that he had built and the meat of his table and the sitting of his servants and the attendance of his ministers and their apparel his cupbearers also and their apparel and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the lord there was no more spirit in her and she said to the king it was a true report which i heard in mine own land of thine acts and of thy wisdom howbeit i believed not their words until i came and
