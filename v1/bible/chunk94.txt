upward even unto fifty years old every one that entereth into the service for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation even those that were numbered of them throughout their families by the house of their fathers were two thousand and six hundred and thirty these are they that were numbered of the families of the sons of gershon of all that might do service in the tabernacle of the congregation whom moses and aaron did number according to the commandment of the lord and those that were numbered of the families of the sons of merari throughout their families by the house of their fathers from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old every one that entereth into the service for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation even those that were numbered of them after their families were three thousand and two hundred these be those that were numbered of the families of the sons of merari whom moses and aaron numbered according to the word of the lord by the hand of moses all those that were numbered of the levites whom moses and aaron and the chief of israel numbered after their families and after the house of their fathers from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old every one that came to do the service of the ministry and the service of the burden in the tabernacle of the congregation even those that were numbered of them were eight thousand and five hundred and fourscore according to the commandment of the lord they were numbered by the hand of moses every one according to his service and according to his burden thus were they numbered of him as the lord commanded moses and the lord spake unto moses saying command the children of israel that they put out of the camp every leper and every one that hath an issue and whosoever is defiled by the dead both male and female shall ye put out without the camp shall ye put them that they defile not their camps in the midst whereof i dwell and the children of israel did so and put them out without the camp as the lord spake unto moses so did the children of israel and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel when a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit to do a trespass against the lord and that person be guilty then they shall confess their sin which they have done and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof and add unto it the fifth part thereof and give it unto him against whom he hath trespassed but if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto let the trespass be recompensed unto the lord even to the priest beside the ram of the atonement whereby an atonement shall be made for him and every offering of all the holy things of the children of israel which they bring unto the priest shall be his and every mans hallowed things shall be his whatsoever any man giveth the priest it shall be his and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them if any mans wife go aside and commit a trespass against him and a man lie with her carnally and it be hid from the eyes of her husband and be kept close and she be defiled and there be no witness against her neither she be taken with the manner and the spirit of jealousy come upon him and he be jealous of his wife and she be defiled or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him and he be jealous of his wife and she be not defiled then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest and he shall bring her offering for her the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal he shall pour no oil upon it nor put frankincense thereon for it is an offering of jealousy an offering of memorial bringing iniquity to remembrance and the priest shall bring her near and set her before the lord and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take and put it into the water and the priest shall set the woman before the lord and uncover the womans head and put the offering of memorial in her hands which is the jealousy offering and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse and the priest shall charge her by an oath and say unto the woman if no man have lain with thee and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of thy husband be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse but if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband and if thou be defiled and some man have lain with thee beside thine husband then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing and the priest shall say unto the woman the lord make thee a curse and an oath among thy people when the lord doth make thy thigh to rot and thy belly to swell and this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels to make thy belly to swell and thy thigh to rot and the woman shall say amen amen and the priest shall write these curses in a book and he shall blot them out with the bitter water and he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the womans hand and shall wave the offering before the lord and offer it upon the altar and the priest shall take an handful of the offering even the memorial thereof and burn it upon the altar and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water and when he hath made her to drink the water then it shall come to pass that if she be defiled and have done trespass
