against the merchant city to destroy the strong holds thereof and he said thou shalt no more rejoice o thou oppressed virgin daughter of zidon arise pass over to chittim there also shalt thou have no rest behold the land of the chaldeans this people was not till the assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness they set up the towers thereof they raised up the palaces thereof and he brought it to ruin howl ye ships of tarshish for your strength is laid waste and it shall come to pass in that day that tyre shall be forgotten seventy years according to the days of one king after the end of seventy years shall tyre sing as an harlot take an harp go about the city thou harlot that hast been forgotten make sweet melody sing many songs that thou mayest be remembered and it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years that the lord will visit tyre and she shall turn to her hire and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth and her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the lord it shall not be treasured nor laid up for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the lord to eat sufficiently and for durable clothing behold the lord maketh the earth empty and maketh it waste and turneth it upside down and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof and it shall be as with the people so with the priest as with the servant so with his master as with the maid so with her mistress as with the buyer so with the seller as with the lender so with the borrower as with the taker of usury so with the giver of usury to him the land shall be utterly emptied and utterly spoiled for the lord hath spoken this word the earth mourneth and fadeth away the world languisheth and fadeth away the haughty people of the earth do languish the earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof because they have transgressed the laws changed the ordinance broken the everlasting covenant therefore hath the curse devoured the earth and they that dwell therein are desolate therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned and few men left the new wine mourneth the vine languisheth all the merryhearted do sigh the mirth of tabrets ceaseth the noise of them that rejoice endeth the joy of the harp ceaseth they shall not drink wine with a song strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it the city of confusion is broken down every house is shut up that no man may come in there is a crying for wine in the streets all joy is darkened the mirth of the land is gone in the city is left desolation and the gate is smitten with destruction when thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done they shall lift up their voice they shall sing for the majesty of the lord they shall cry aloud from the sea wherefore glorify ye the lord in the fires even the name of the lord god of israel in the isles of the sea from the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs even glory to the righteous but i said my leanness my leanness woe unto me the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously yea the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously fear and the pit and the snare are upon thee o inhabitant of the earth and it shall come to pass that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare for the windows from on high are open and the foundations of the earth do shake the earth is utterly broken down the earth is clean dissolved the earth is moved exceedingly the earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard and shall be removed like a cottage and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it and it shall fall and not rise again and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high and the kings of the earth upon the earth and they shall be gathered together as prisoners are gathered in the pit and shall be shut up in the prison and after many days shall they be visited then the moon shall be confounded and the sun ashamed when the lord of hosts shall reign in mount zion and in jerusalem and before his ancients gloriously o lord thou art my god i will exalt thee i will praise thy name for thou hast done wonderful things thy counsels of old are faithfulness and truth for thou hast made of a city an heap of a defenced city a ruin a palace of strangers to be no city it shall never be built therefore shall the strong people glorify thee the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee for thou hast been a strength to the poor a strength to the needy in his distress a refuge from the storm a shadow from the heat when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers as the heat in a dry place even the heat with the shadow of a cloud the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low and in this mountain shall the lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things a feast of wines on the lees of fat things full of marrow of wines on the lees well refined and he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people and the vail that is spread over all nations he will swallow up death in victory and the lord god will wipe away tears from off all faces and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth for the lord
