priests servant came and said to the man that sacrificed give flesh to roast for the priest for he will not have sodden flesh of thee but raw and if any man said unto him let them not fail to burn the fat presently and then take as much as thy soul desireth then he would answer him nay but thou shalt give it me now and if not i will take it by force wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the lord for men abhorred the offering of the lord but samuel ministered before the lord being a child girded with a linen ephod moreover his mother made him a little coat and brought it to him from year to year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice and eli blessed elkanah and his wife and said the lord give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the lord and they went unto their own home and the lord visited hannah so that she conceived and bare three sons and two daughters and the child samuel grew before the lord now eli was very old and heard all that his sons did unto all israel and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and he said unto them why do ye such things for i hear of your evil dealings by all this people nay my sons for it is no good report that i hear ye make the lords people to transgress if one man sin against another the judge shall judge him but if a man sin against the lord who shall intreat for him notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father because the lord would slay them and the child samuel grew on and was in favour both with the lord and also with men and there came a man of god unto eli and said unto him thus saith the lord did i plainly appear unto the house of thy father when they were in egypt in pharaohs house and did i choose him out of all the tribes of israel to be my priest to offer upon mine altar to burn incense to wear an ephod before me and did i give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of israel wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering which i have commanded in my habitation and honourest thy sons above me to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of israel my people wherefore the lord god of israel saith i said indeed that thy house and the house of thy father should walk before me for ever but now the lord saith be it far from me for them that honour me i will honour and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed behold the days come that i will cut off thine arm and the arm of thy fathers house that there shall not be an old man in thine house and thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation in all the wealth which god shall give israel and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever and the man of thine whom i shall not cut off from mine altar shall be to consume thine eyes and to grieve thine heart and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age and this shall be a sign unto thee that shall come upon thy two sons on hophni and phinehas in one day they shall die both of them and i will raise me up a faithful priest that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind and i will build him a sure house and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever and it shall come to pass that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread and shall say put me i pray thee into one of the priests offices that i may eat a piece of bread and the child samuel ministered unto the lord before eli and the word of the lord was precious in those days there was no open vision and it came to pass at that time when eli was laid down in his place and his eyes began to wax dim that he could not see and ere the lamp of god went out in the temple of the lord where the ark of god was and samuel was laid down to sleep that the lord called samuel and he answered here am i and he ran unto eli and said here am i for thou calledst me and he said i called not lie down again and he went and lay down and the lord called yet again samuel and samuel arose and went to eli and said here am i for thou didst call me and he answered i called not my son lie down again now samuel did not yet know the lord neither was the word of the lord yet revealed unto him and the lord called samuel again the third time and he arose and went to eli and said here am i for thou didst call me and eli perceived that the lord had called the child therefore eli said unto samuel go lie down and it shall be if he call thee that thou shalt say speak lord for thy servant heareth so samuel went and lay down in his place and the lord came and stood and called as at other times samuel samuel then samuel answered speak for thy servant heareth and the lord said to samuel behold i will do a thing in israel at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle in that day i will perform against eli all things which i have spoken concerning his house when i begin i will also make an end for i have told him that i will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth because his sons
