the way of the mountain of the amorites as the lord our god commanded us and we came to kadeshbarnea and i said unto you ye are come unto the mountain of the amorites which the lord our god doth give unto us behold the lord thy god hath set the land before thee go up and possess it as the lord god of thy fathers hath said unto thee fear not neither be discouraged and ye came near unto me every one of you and said we will send men before us and they shall search us out the land and bring us word again by what way we must go up and into what cities we shall come and the saying pleased me well and i took twelve men of you one of a tribe and they turned and went up into the mountain and came unto the valley of eshcol and searched it out and they took of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down unto us and brought us word again and said it is a good land which the lord our god doth give us notwithstanding ye would not go up but rebelled against the commandment of the lord your god and ye murmured in your tents and said because the lord hated us he hath brought us forth out of the land of egypt to deliver us into the hand of the amorites to destroy us whither shall we go up our brethren have discouraged our heart saying the people is greater and taller than we the cities are great and walled up to heaven and moreover we have seen the sons of the anakims there then i said unto you dread not neither be afraid of them the lord your god which goeth before you he shall fight for you according to all that he did for you in egypt before your eyes and in the wilderness where thou hast seen how that the lord thy god bare thee as a man doth bear his son in all the way that ye went until ye came into this place yet in this thing ye did not believe the lord your god who went in the way before you to search you out a place to pitch your tents in in fire by night to shew you by what way ye should go and in a cloud by day and the lord heard the voice of your words and was wroth and sware saying surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land which i sware to give unto your fathers save caleb the son of jephunneh he shall see it and to him will i give the land that he hath trodden upon and to his children because he hath wholly followed the lord also the lord was angry with me for your sakes saying thou also shalt not go in thither but joshua the son of nun which standeth before thee he shall go in thither encourage him for he shall cause israel to inherit it moreover your little ones which ye said should be a prey and your children which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil they shall go in thither and unto them will i give it and they shall possess it but as for you turn you and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the red sea then ye answered and said unto me we have sinned against the lord we will go up and fight according to all that the lord our god commanded us and when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war ye were ready to go up into the hill and the lord said unto me say unto them go not up neither fight for i am not among you lest ye be smitten before your enemies so i spake unto you and ye would not hear but rebelled against the commandment of the lord and went presumptuously up into the hill and the amorites which dwelt in that mountain came out against you and chased you as bees do and destroyed you in seir even unto hormah and ye returned and wept before the lord but the lord would not hearken to your voice nor give ear unto you so ye abode in kadesh many days according unto the days that ye abode there then we turned and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the red sea as the lord spake unto me and we compassed mount seir many days and the lord spake unto me saying ye have compassed this mountain long enough turn you northward and command thou the people saying ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of esau which dwell in seir and they shall be afraid of you take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore meddle not with them for i will not give you of their land no not so much as a foot breadth because i have given mount seir unto esau for a possession ye shall buy meat of them for money that ye may eat and ye shall also buy water of them for money that ye may drink for the lord thy god hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness these forty years the lord thy god hath been with thee thou hast lacked nothing and when we passed by from our brethren the children of esau which dwelt in seir through the way of the plain from elath and from eziongaber we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of moab and the lord said unto me distress not the moabites neither contend with them in battle for i will not give thee of their land for a possession because i have given ar unto the children of lot for a possession the emims dwelt therein in times past a people great and many and tall as the anakims which also were accounted giants as the anakims but the moabites called them emims the horims also dwelt in seir beforetime but the children of esau succeeded them when they had destroyed them from before them and
