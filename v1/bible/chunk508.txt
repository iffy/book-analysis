i live saith the lord god i will not be enquired of by you and that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all that ye say we will be as the heathen as the families of the countries to serve wood and stone as i live saith the lord god surely with a mighty hand and with a stretched out arm and with fury poured out will i rule over you and i will bring you out from the people and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered with a mighty hand and with a stretched out arm and with fury poured out and i will bring you into the wilderness of the people and there will i plead with you face to face like as i pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of egypt so will i plead with you saith the lord god and i will cause you to pass under the rod and i will bring you into the bond of the covenant and i will purge out from among you the rebels and them that transgress against me i will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn and they shall not enter into the land of israel and ye shall know that i am the lord as for you o house of israel thus saith the lord god go ye serve ye every one his idols and hereafter also if ye will not hearken unto me but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts and with your idols for in mine holy mountain in the mountain of the height of israel saith the lord god there shall all the house of israel all of them in the land serve me there will i accept them and there will i require your offerings and the firstfruits of your oblations with all your holy things i will accept you with your sweet savour when i bring you out from the people and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered and i will be sanctified in you before the heathen and ye shall know that i am the lord when i shall bring you into the land of israel into the country for the which i lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers and there shall ye remember your ways and all your doings wherein ye have been defiled and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed and ye shall know that i am the lord when i have wrought with you for my names sake not according to your wicked ways nor according to your corrupt doings o ye house of israel saith the lord god moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man set thy face toward the south and drop thy word toward the south and prophesy against the forest of the south field and say to the forest of the south hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord god behold i will kindle a fire in thee and it shall devour every green tree in thee and every dry tree the flaming flame shall not be quenched and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein and all flesh shall see that i the lord have kindled it it shall not be quenched then said i ah lord god they say of me doth he not speak parables and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man set thy face toward jerusalem and drop thy word toward the holy places and prophesy against the land of israel and say to the land of israel thus saith the lord behold i am against thee and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked seeing then that i will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north that all flesh may know that i the lord have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath it shall not return any more sigh therefore thou son of man with the breaking of thy loins and with bitterness sigh before their eyes and it shall be when they say unto thee wherefore sighest thou that thou shalt answer for the tidings because it cometh and every heart shall melt and all hands shall be feeble and every spirit shall faint and all knees shall be weak as water behold it cometh and shall be brought to pass saith the lord god again the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man prophesy and say thus saith the lord say a sword a sword is sharpened and also furbished it is sharpened to make a sore slaughter it is furbished that it may glitter should we then make mirth it contemneth the rod of my son as every tree and he hath given it to be furbished that it may be handled this sword is sharpened and it is furbished to give it into the hand of the slayer cry and howl son of man for it shall be upon my people it shall be upon all the princes of israel terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people smite therefore upon thy thigh because it is a trial and what if the sword contemn even the rod it shall be no more saith the lord god thou therefore son of man prophesy and smite thine hands together and let the sword be doubled the third time the sword of the slain it is the sword of the great men that are slain which entereth into their privy chambers i have set the point of the sword against all their gates that their heart may faint and their ruins be multiplied ah it is made bright it is wrapped up for the slaughter go thee one way or other either on the right hand or on the left whithersoever thy face is set i will also smite mine hands together and i will cause my fury to rest i the lord
