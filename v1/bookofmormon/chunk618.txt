unto such shall ye continue to minister for ye know not but what they will return and repent and come unto me with full purpose of heart and i shall heal them and ye shall be the means of bringing salvation unto them therefore keep these sayings which i have commanded you that ye come not under condemnation for wo unto him whom the father condemneth and i give you these commandments because of the disputations which have been among you and blessed are ye if ye have no disputations among you and now i go unto the father because it is expedient that i should go unto the father for your sakes and it came to pass that when jesus had made an end of these sayings he touched with his hand the disciples whom he had chosen one by one even until he had touched them all and spake unto them as he touched them and the multitude heard not the words which he spake therefore they did not bear record but the disciples bare record that he gave them power to give the holy ghost and i will show unto you hereafter that this record is true and it came to pass that when jesus had touched them all there came a cloud and overshadowed the multitude that they could not see jesus and while they were overshadowed he departed from them and ascended into heaven and the disciples saw and did bear record that he ascended again into heaven nephi chapter and now it came to pass that when jesus had ascended into heaven the multitude did disperse and every man did take his wife and his children and did return to his own home and it was noised abroad among the people immediately before it was yet dark that the multitude had seen jesus and that he had ministered unto them and that he would also show himself on the morrow unto the multitude yea and even all the night it was noised abroad concerning jesus and insomuch did they send forth unto the people that there were many yea an exceedingly great number did labor exceedingly all
