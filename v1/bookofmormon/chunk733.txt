christ and setteth at naught the atonement of him and the power of his redemption wo unto such for they are in danger of death hell and an endless torment i speak it boldly god hath commanded me listen unto them and give heed or they stand against you at the judgment-seat of christ for behold that all little children are alive in christ and also all they that are without the law for the power of redemption cometh on all them that have no law wherefore he that is not condemned or he that is under no condemnation cannot repent and unto such baptism availeth nothing but it is mockery before god denying the mercies of christ and the power of his holy spirit and putting trust in dead works behold my son this thing ought not to be for repentance is unto them that are under condemnation and under the curse of a broken law and the first fruits of repentance is baptism and baptism cometh by faith unto the fulfilling the commandments and the fulfilling the commandments bringeth remission of sins and the remission of sins bringeth meekness and lowliness of heart and because of meekness and lowliness of heart cometh the visitation of the holy ghost which comforter filleth with hope and perfect love which love endureth by diligence unto prayer until the end shall come when all the saints shall dwell with god behold my son i will write unto you again if i go not out soon against the lamanites behold the pride of this nation or the people of the nephites hath proven their destruction except they should repent pray for them my son that repentance may come unto them but behold i fear lest the spirit hath ceased striving with them and in this part of the land they are also seeking to put down all power and authority which cometh from god and they are denying the holy ghost and after rejecting so great a knowledge my son they must perish soon unto the fulfilling of the prophecies which were spoken by the prophets as well as the words of our savior himself farewell
