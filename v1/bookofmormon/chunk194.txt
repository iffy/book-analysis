spend my days in your service even up to this time and have not sought gold nor silver nor any manner of riches of you neither have i suffered that ye should be confined in dungeons nor that ye should make slaves one of another nor that ye should murder or plunder or steal or commit adultery nor even have i suffered that ye should commit any manner of wickedness and have taught you that ye should keep the commandments of the lord in all things which he hath commanded you and even i myself have labored with mine own hands that i might serve you and that ye should not be laden with taxes and that there should nothing come upon you which was grievous to be borne and of all these things which i have spoken ye yourselves are witnesses this day yet my brethren i have not done these things that i might boast neither do i tell these things that thereby i might accuse you but i tell you these things that ye may know that i can answer a clear conscience before god this day behold i say unto you that because i said unto you that i had spent my days in your service i do not desire to boast for i have only been in the service of god and behold i tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your god behold ye have called me your king and if i whom ye call your king do labor to serve you then ought not ye to labor to serve one another and behold also if i whom ye call your king who has spent his days in your service and yet has been in the service of god do merit any thanks from you o how you ought to thank your heavenly king i say unto you my brethren that if you should render all the thanks and praise which your whole soul has power to possess to that god who has created
