nephites and they fled again from before them and they came to the city boaz and there they did stand against the lamanites with exceeding boldness insomuch that the lamanites did not beat them until they had come again the second time and when they had come the second time the nephites were driven and slaughtered with an exceedingly great slaughter their women and their children were again sacrificed unto idols and it came to pass that the nephites did again flee from before them taking all the inhabitants with them both in towns and villages and now i mormon seeing that the lamanites were about to overthrow the land therefore i did go to the hill shim and did take up all the records which ammaron had hid up unto the lord mormon chapter and it came to pass that i did go forth among the nephites and did repent of the oath which i had made that i would no more assist them and they gave me command again of their armies for they looked upon me as though i could deliver them from their afflictions but behold i was without hope for i knew the judgments of the lord which should come upon them for they repented not of their iniquities but did struggle for their lives without calling upon that being who created them and it came to pass that the lamanites did come against us as we had fled to the city of jordan but behold they were driven back that they did not take the city at that time and it came to pass that they came against us again and we did maintain the city and there were also other cities which were maintained by nephites which strongholds did cut them off that they could not get into the country which lay before us to destroy the inhabitants of our land and it came to pass that whatsoever lands we had passed by and the inhabitants thereof were not gathered in were destroyed by the lamanites and their towns and villages and cities were burned with fire and thus three hundred and seventy and nine years
