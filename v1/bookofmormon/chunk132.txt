slay them wherefore the cry of the blood of the saints shall ascend up to god from the ground against them wherefore all those who are proud and that do wickedly the day that cometh shall burn them up saith the lord of hosts for they shall be as stubble and they that kill the prophets and the saints the depths of the earth shall swallow them up saith the lord of hosts and mountains shall cover them and whirlwinds shall carry them away and buildings shall fall upon them and crush them to pieces and grind them to powder and they shall be visited with thunderings and lightnings and earthquakes and all manner of destructions for the fire of the anger of the lord shall be kindled against them and they shall be as stubble and the day that cometh shall consume them saith the lord of hosts o the pain and the anguish of my soul for the loss of the slain of my people for i nephi have seen it and it well nigh consumeth me before the presence of the lord but i must cry unto my god thy ways are just but behold the righteous that hearken unto the words of the prophets and destroy them not but look forward unto christ with steadfastness for the signs which are given notwithstanding all persecution behold they are they which shall not perish but the son of righteousness shall appear unto them and he shall heal them and they shall have peace with him until three generations shall have passed away and many of the fourth generation shall have passed away in righteousness and when these things have passed away a speedy destruction cometh unto my people for notwithstanding the pains of my soul i have seen it wherefore i know that it shall come to pass and they sell themselves for naught for for the reward of their pride and their foolishness they shall reap destruction for because they yield unto the devil and choose works of darkness rather than light therefore they must go down to hell for the spirit of the lord will not always strive with man
