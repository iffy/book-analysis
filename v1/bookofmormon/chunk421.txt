at the resurrection of christ but behold i give it as my opinion that the souls and the bodies are reunited of the righteous at the resurrection of christ and his ascension into heaven but whether it be at his resurrection or after i do not say but this much i say that there is a space between death and the resurrection of the body and a state of the soul in happiness or in misery until the time which is appointed of god that the dead shall come forth and be reunited both soul and body and be brought to stand before god and be judged according to their works yea this bringeth about the restoration of those things of which has been spoken by the mouths of the prophets the soul shall be restored to the body and the body to the soul yea and every limb and joint shall be restored to its body yea even a hair of the head shall not be lost but all things shall be restored to their proper and perfect frame and now my son this is the restoration of which has been spoken by the mouths of the prophets and then shall the righteous shine forth in the kingdom of god but behold an awful death cometh upon the wicked for they die as to things pertaining to things of righteousness for they are unclean and no unclean thing can inherit the kingdom of god but they are cast out and consigned to partake of the fruits of their labors or their works which have been evil and they drink the dregs of a bitter cup alma chapter and now my son i have somewhat to say concerning the restoration of which has been spoken for behold some have wrested the scriptures and have gone far astray because of this thing and i perceive that thy mind has been worried also concerning this thing but behold i will explain it unto thee i say unto thee my son that the plan of restoration is requisite with the justice of god for it is requisite that all things should be restored to their proper order
