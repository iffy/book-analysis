of jared what will ye that i should do that ye may have light in your vessels for behold ye cannot have windows for they will be dashed in pieces neither shall ye take fire with you for ye shall not go by the light of fire for behold ye shall be as a whale in the midst of the sea for the mountain waves shall dash upon you nevertheless i will bring you up again out of the depths of the sea for the winds have gone forth out of my mouth and also the rains and the floods have i sent forth and behold i prepare you against these things for ye cannot cross this great deep save i prepare you against the waves of the sea and the winds which have gone forth and the floods which shall come therefore what will ye that i should prepare for you that ye may have light when ye are swallowed up in the depths of the sea ether chapter and it came to pass that the brother of jared now the number of the vessels which had been prepared was eight went forth unto the mount which they called the mount shelem because of its exceeding height and did molten out of a rock sixteen small stones and they were white and clear even as transparent glass and he did carry them in his hands upon the top of the mount and cried again unto the lord saying o lord thou hast said that we must be encompassed about by the floods now behold o lord and do not be angry with thy servant because of his weakness before thee for we know that thou art holy and dwellest in the heavens and that we are unworthy before thee because of the fall our natures have become evil continually nevertheless o lord thou hast given us a commandment that we must call upon thee that from thee we may receive according to our desires behold o lord thou hast smitten us because of our iniquity and hast driven us forth and for these many years we have been in the wilderness nevertheless
