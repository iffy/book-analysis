unto this people that thus saith the lord god who is the almighty except ye repent ye shall be smitten even unto destruction and behold now it came to pass that when the lord had spoken these words unto nephi he did stop and did not go unto his own house but did return unto the multitudes who were scattered about upon the face of the land and began to declare unto them the word of the lord which had been spoken unto him concerning their destruction if they did not repent now behold notwithstanding that great miracle which nephi had done in telling them concerning the death of the chief judge they did harden their hearts and did not hearken unto the words of the lord therefore nephi did declare unto them the word of the lord saying except ye repent thus saith the lord ye shall be smitten even unto destruction and it came to pass that when nephi had declared unto them the word behold they did still harden their hearts and would not hearken unto his words therefore they did revile against him and did seek to lay their hands upon him that they might cast him into prison but behold the power of god was with him and they could not take him to cast him into prison for he was taken by the spirit and conveyed away out of the midst of them and it came to pass that thus he did go forth in the spirit from multitude to multitude declaring the word of god even until he had declared it unto them all or sent it forth among all the people and it came to pass that they would not hearken unto his words and there began to be contentions insomuch that they were divided against themselves and began to slay one another with the sword and thus ended the seventy and first year of the reign of the judges over the people of nephi helaman chapter and now it came to pass in the seventy and second year of the reign of the judges that the contentions did increase insomuch that there were wars
