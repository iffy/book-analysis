he commanded them that there should be no contention one with another but that they should look forward with one eye having one faith and one baptism having their hearts knit together in unity and in love one towards another and thus he commanded them to preach and thus they became the children of god and he commanded them that they should observe the sabbath day and keep it holy and also every day they should give thanks to the lord their god and he also commanded them that the priests whom he had ordained should labor with their own hands for their support and there was one day in every week that was set apart that they should gather themselves together to teach the people and to worship the lord their god and also as often as it was in their power to assemble themselves together and the priests were not to depend upon the people for their support but for their labor they were to receive the grace of god that they might wax strong in the spirit having the knowledge of god that they might teach with power and authority from god and again alma commanded that the people of the church should impart of their substance every one according to that which he had if he have more abundantly he should impart more abundantly and of him that had but little but little should be required and to him that had not should be given and thus they should impart of their substance of their own free will and good desires towards god and to those priests that stood in need yea and to every needy naked soul and this he said unto them having been commanded of god and they did walk uprightly before god imparting to one another both temporally and spiritually according to their needs and their wants and now it came to pass that all this was done in mormon yea by the waters of mormon in the forest that was near the waters of mormon yea the place of mormon the waters of mormon the forest of mormon how beautiful are they to the eyes
