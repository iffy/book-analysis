i jacob take it upon me to fulfil the commandment of my brother nephi now nephi began to be old and he saw that he must soon die wherefore he anointed a man to be a king and a ruler over his people now according to the reigns of the kings the people having loved nephi exceedingly he having been a great protector for them having wielded the sword of laban in their defence and having labored in all his days for their welfare wherefore the people were desirous to retain in remembrance his name and whoso should reign in his stead were called by the people second nephi third nephi and so forth according to the reigns of the kings and thus they were called by the people let them be of whatever name they would and it came to pass that nephi died now the people which were not lamanites were nephites nevertheless they were called nephites jacobites josephites zoramites lamanites lemuelites and ishmaelites but i jacob shall not hereafter distinguish them by these names but i shall call them lamanites that seek to destroy the people of nephi and those who are friendly to nephi i shall call nephites or the people of nephi according to the reigns of the kings and now it came to pass that the people of nephi under the reign of the second king began to grow hard in their hearts and indulge themselves somewhat in wicked practices such as like unto david of old desiring many wives and concubines and also solomon his son yea and they also began to search much gold and silver and began to be lifted up somewhat in pride wherefore i jacob gave unto them these words as i taught them in the temple having first obtained mine errand from the lord for i jacob and my brother joseph had been consecrated priests and teachers of this people by the hand of nephi and we did magnify our office unto the lord taking upon us the responsibility answering the sins of the people upon our own heads if we did not teach them the word of god with all diligence
