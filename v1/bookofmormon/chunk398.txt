destruction and thou didst hear me because of mine afflictions and my sincerity and it is because of thy son that thou hast been thus merciful unto me therefore i will cry unto thee in all mine afflictions for in thee is my joy for thou hast turned thy judgments away from me because of thy son and now alma said unto them do ye believe those scriptures which have been written by them of old behold if ye do ye must believe what zenos said for behold he said thou hast turned away thy judgments because of thy son now behold my brethren i would ask if ye have read the scriptures if ye have how can ye disbelieve on the son of god for it is not written that zenos alone spake of these things but zenock also spake of these things for behold he said thou art angry o lord with this people because they will not understand thy mercies which thou hast bestowed upon them because of thy son and now my brethren ye see that a second prophet of old has testified of the son of god and because the people would not understand his words they stoned him to death but behold this is not all these are not the only ones who have spoken concerning the son of god behold he was spoken of by moses yea and behold a type was raised up in the wilderness that whosoever would look upon it might live and many did look and live but few understood the meaning of those things and this because of the hardness of their hearts but there were many who were so hardened that they would not look therefore they perished now the reason they would not look is because they did not believe that it would heal them o my brethren if ye could be healed by merely casting about your eyes that ye might be healed would ye not behold quickly or would ye rather harden your hearts in unbelief and be slothful that ye would not cast about your eyes that ye might perish if so wo shall come upon you
