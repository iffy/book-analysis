truth that thy soul may be destroyed but behold it is better that thy soul should be lost than that thou shouldst be the means of bringing many souls down to destruction by thy lying and by thy flattering words therefore if thou shalt deny again behold god shall smite thee that thou shalt become dumb that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more that thou shalt not deceive this people any more now korihor said unto him i do not deny the existence of a god but i do not believe that there is a god and i say also that ye do not know that there is a god and except ye show me a sign i will not believe now alma said unto him this will i give unto thee for a sign that thou shalt be struck dumb according to my words and i say that in the name of god ye shall be struck dumb that ye shall no more have utterance now when alma had said these words korihor was struck dumb that he could not have utterance according to the words of alma and now when the chief judge saw this he put forth his hand and wrote unto korihor saying art thou convinced of the power of god in whom did ye desire that alma should show forth his sign would ye that he should afflict others to show unto thee a sign behold he has showed unto you a sign and now will ye dispute more and korihor put forth his hand and wrote saying i know that i am dumb for i cannot speak and i know that nothing save it were the power of god could bring this upon me yea and i always knew that there was a god but behold the devil hath deceived me for he appeared unto me in the form of an angel and said unto me go and reclaim this people for they have all gone astray after an unknown god and he said unto me there is no god yea and he taught me that which i should say and i have taught his words
