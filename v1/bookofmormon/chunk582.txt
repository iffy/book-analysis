before me i am mormon and a pure descendant of lehi i have reason to bless my god and my savior jesus christ that he brought our fathers out of the land of jerusalem and no one knew it save it were himself and those whom he brought out of that land and that he hath given me and my people so much knowledge unto the salvation of our souls surely he hath blessed the house of jacob and hath been merciful unto the seed of joseph and insomuch as the children of lehi have kept his commandments he hath blessed them and prospered them according to his word yea and surely shall he again bring a remnant of the seed of joseph to the knowledge of the lord their god and as surely as the lord liveth will he gather in from the four quarters of the earth all the remnant of the seed of jacob who are scattered abroad upon all the face of the earth and as he hath covenanted with all the house of jacob even so shall the covenant wherewith he hath covenanted with the house of jacob be fulfilled in his own due time unto the restoring all the house of jacob unto the knowledge of the covenant that he hath covenanted with them and then shall they know their redeemer who is jesus christ the son of god and then shall they be gathered in from the four quarters of the earth unto their own lands from whence they have been dispersed yea as the lord liveth so shall it be amen nephi chapter and now it came to pass that the people of the nephites did all return to their own lands in the twenty and sixth year every man with his family his flocks and his herds his horses and his cattle and all things whatsoever did belong unto them and it came to pass that they had not eaten up all their provisions therefore they did take with them all that they had not devoured of all their grain of every kind and their gold and their silver and all their precious things
