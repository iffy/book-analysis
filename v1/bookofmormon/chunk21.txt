iron and it extended along the bank of the river and led to the tree by which i stood and i also beheld a strait and narrow path which came along by the rod of iron even to the tree by which i stood and it also led by the head of the fountain unto a large and spacious field as if it had been a world and i saw numberless concourses of people many of whom were pressing forward that they might obtain the path which led unto the tree by which i stood and it came to pass that they did come forth and commence in the path which led to the tree and it came to pass that there arose a mist of darkness yea even an exceedingly great mist of darkness insomuch that they who had commenced in the path did lose their way that they wandered off and were lost and it came to pass that i beheld others pressing forward and they came forth and caught hold of the end of the rod of iron and they did press forward through the mist of darkness clinging to the rod of iron even until they did come forth and partake of the fruit of the tree and after they had partaken of the fruit of the tree they did cast their eyes about as if they were ashamed and i also cast my eyes round about and beheld on the other side of the river of water a great and spacious building and it stood as it were in the air high above the earth and it was filled with people both old and young both male and female and their manner of dress was exceedingly fine and they were in the attitude of mocking and pointing their fingers towards those who had come at and were partaking of the fruit and after they had tasted of the fruit they were ashamed because of those that were scoffing at them and they fell away into forbidden paths and were lost and now i nephi do not speak all the words of my father but to be short in writing
