ye have been oppressed by king noah and have been in bondage to him and his priests and have been brought into iniquity by them therefore ye were bound with the bands of iniquity and now as ye have been delivered by the power of god out of these bonds yea even out of the hands of king noah and his people and also from the bonds of iniquity even so i desire that ye should stand fast in this liberty wherewith ye have been made free and that ye trust no man to be a king over you and also trust no one to be your teacher nor your minister except he be a man of god walking in his ways and keeping his commandments thus did alma teach his people that every man should love his neighbor as himself that there should be no contention among them and now alma was their high priest he being the founder of their church and it came to pass that none received authority to preach or to teach except it were by him from god therefore he consecrated all their priests and all their teachers and none were consecrated except they were just men therefore they did watch over their people and did nourish them with things pertaining to righteousness and it came to pass that they began to prosper exceedingly in the land and they called the land helam and it came to pass that they did multiply and prosper exceedingly in the land of helam and they built a city which they called the city of helam nevertheless the lord seeth fit to chasten his people yea he trieth their patience and their faith nevertheless whosoever putteth his trust in him the same shall be lifted up at the last day yea and thus it was with this people for behold i will show unto you that they were brought into bondage and none could deliver them but the lord their god yea even the god of abraham and isaac and of jacob and it came to pass that he did deliver them and he did show forth his mighty power unto them
