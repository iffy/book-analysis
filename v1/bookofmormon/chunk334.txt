scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of ammonihah for many years and it was called desolation of nehors for they were of the profession of nehor who were slain and their lands remained desolate and the lamanites did not come again to war against the nephites until the fourteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of nephi and thus for three years did the people of nephi have continual peace in all the land and alma and amulek went forth preaching repentance to the people in their temples and in their sanctuaries and also in their synagogues which were built after the manner of the jews and as many as would hear their words unto them they did impart the word of god without any respect of persons continually and thus did alma and amulek go forth and also many more who had been chosen for the work to preach the word throughout all the land and the establishment of the church became general throughout the land in all the region round about among all the people of the nephites and there was no inequality among them the lord did pour out his spirit on all the face of the land to prepare the minds of the children of men or to prepare their hearts to receive the word which should be taught among them at the time of his coming that they might not be hardened against the word that they might not be unbelieving and go on to destruction but that they might receive the word with joy and as a branch be grafted into the true vine that they might enter into the rest of the lord their god now those priests who did go forth among the people did preach against all lyings and deceivings and envyings and strifes and malice and revilings and stealing robbing plundering murdering committing adultery and all manner of lasciviousness crying that these things ought not so to be holding forth things which must shortly come yea holding forth the coming of the son of god his sufferings and death and also the resurrection
