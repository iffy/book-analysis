you and has kept and preserved you and has caused that ye should rejoice and has granted that ye should live in peace one with another i say unto you that if ye should serve him who has created you from the beginning and is preserving you from day to day by lending you breath that ye may live and move and do according to your own will and even supporting you from one moment to another i say if ye should serve him with all your whole souls yet ye would be unprofitable servants and behold all that he requires of you is to keep his commandments and he has promised you that if ye would keep his commandments ye should prosper in the land and he never doth vary from that which he hath said therefore if ye do keep his commandments he doth bless you and prosper you and now in the first place he hath created you and granted unto you your lives for which ye are indebted unto him and secondly he doth require that ye should do as he hath commanded you for which if ye do he doth immediately bless you and therefore he hath paid you and ye are still indebted unto him and are and will be forever and ever therefore of what have ye to boast and now i ask can ye say aught of yourselves i answer you nay ye cannot say that ye are even as much as the dust of the earth yet ye were created of the dust of the earth but behold it belongeth to him who created you and i even i whom ye call your king am no better than ye yourselves are for i am also of the dust and ye behold that i am old and am about to yield up this mortal frame to its mother earth therefore as i said unto you that i had served you walking with a clear conscience before god even so i at this time have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together that i might be found blameless and that your blood should not come upon me
