state which man had brought upon himself because of his own disobedience therefore according to justice the plan of redemption could not be brought about only on conditions of repentance of men in this probationary state yea this preparatory state for except it were for these conditions mercy could not take effect except it should destroy the work of justice now the work of justice could not be destroyed if so god would cease to be god and thus we see that all mankind were fallen and they were in the grasp of justice yea the justice of god which consigned them forever to be cut off from his presence and now the plan of mercy could not be brought about except an atonement should be made therefore god himself atoneth for the sins of the world to bring about the plan of mercy to appease the demands of justice that god might be a perfect just god and a merciful god also now repentance could not come unto men except there were a punishment which also was eternal as the life of the soul should be affixed opposite to the plan of happiness which was as eternal also as the life of the soul now how could a man repent except he should sin how could he sin if there was no law how could there be a law save there was a punishment now there was a punishment affixed and a just law given which brought remorse of conscience unto man now if there was no law given if a man murdered he should die would he be afraid he would die if he should murder and also if there was no law given against sin men would not be afraid to sin and if there was no law given if men sinned what could justice do or mercy either for they would have no claim upon the creature but there is a law given and a punishment affixed and a repentance granted which repentance mercy claimeth otherwise justice claimeth the creature and executeth the law and the law inflicteth the punishment if not so the works of justice would be destroyed
