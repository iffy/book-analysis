not many years and when nephi saw it his heart was swollen with sorrow within his breast and he did exclaim in the agony of his soul oh that i could have had my days in the days when my father nephi first came out of the land of jerusalem that i could have joyed with him in the promised land then were his people easy to be entreated firm to keep the commandments of god and slow to be led to do iniquity and they were quick to hearken unto the words of the lord yea if my days could have been in those days then would my soul have had joy in the righteousness of my brethren but behold i am consigned that these are my days and that my soul shall be filled with sorrow because of this the wickedness of my brethren and behold now it came to pass that it was upon a tower which was in the garden of nephi which was by the highway which led to the chief market which was in the city of zarahemla therefore nephi had bowed himself upon the tower which was in his garden which tower was also near unto the garden gate by which led the highway and it came to pass that there were certain men passing by and saw nephi as he was pouring out his soul unto god upon the tower and they ran and told the people what they had seen and the people came together in multitudes that they might know the cause of so great mourning for the wickedness of the people and now when nephi arose he beheld the multitudes of people who had gathered together and it came to pass that he opened his mouth and said unto them behold why have ye gathered yourselves together that i may tell you of your iniquities yea because i have got upon my tower that i might pour out my soul unto my god because of the exceeding sorrow of my heart which is because of your iniquities and because of my mourning and lamentation ye have gathered yourselves together and do marvel
