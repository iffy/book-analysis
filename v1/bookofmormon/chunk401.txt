shall bring salvation to all those who shall believe on his name this being the intent of this last sacrifice to bring about the bowels of mercy which overpowereth justice and bringeth about means unto men that they may have faith unto repentance and thus mercy can satisfy the demands of justice and encircles them in the arms of safety while he that exercises no faith unto repentance is exposed to the whole law of the demands of justice therefore only unto him that has faith unto repentance is brought about the great and eternal plan of redemption therefore may god grant unto you my brethren that ye may begin to exercise your faith unto repentance that ye begin to call upon his holy name that he would have mercy upon you yea cry unto him for mercy for he is mighty to save yea humble yourselves and continue in prayer unto him cry unto him when ye are in your fields yea over all your flocks cry unto him in your houses yea over all your household both morning mid-day and evening yea cry unto him against the power of your enemies yea cry unto him against the devil who is an enemy to all righteousness cry unto him over the crops of your fields that ye may prosper in them cry over the flocks of your fields that they may increase but this is not all ye must pour out your souls in your closets and your secret places and in your wilderness yea and when you do not cry unto the lord let your hearts be full drawn out in prayer unto him continually for your welfare and also for the welfare of those who are around you and now behold my beloved brethren i say unto you do not suppose that this is all for after ye have done all these things if ye turn away the needy and the naked and visit not the sick and afflicted and impart of your substance if ye have to those who stand in need i say unto you if ye do not any of these things behold your prayer is vain and
