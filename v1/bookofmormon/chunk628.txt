the gentiles yea in the midst of them as a lion among the beasts of the forest as a young lion among the flocks of sheep who if he go through both treadeth down and teareth in pieces and none can deliver their hand shall be lifted up upon their adversaries and all their enemies shall be cut off yea wo be unto the gentiles except they repent for it shall come to pass in that day saith the father that i will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee and i will destroy thy chariots and i will cut off the cities of thy land and throw down all thy strongholds and i will cut off witchcrafts out of thy land and thou shalt have no more soothsayers thy graven images i will also cut off and thy standing images out of the midst of thee and thou shalt no more worship the works of thy hands and i will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee so will i destroy thy cities and it shall come to pass that all lyings and deceivings and envyings and strifes and priestcrafts and whoredoms shall be done away for it shall come to pass saith the father that at that day whosoever will not repent and come unto my beloved son them will i cut off from among my people o house of israel and i will execute vengeance and fury upon them even as upon the heathen such as they have not heard but if they will repent and hearken unto my words and harden not their hearts i will establish my church among them and they shall come in unto the covenant and be numbered among this the remnant of jacob unto whom i have given this land for their inheritance and they shall assist my people the remnant of jacob and also as many of the house of israel as shall come that they may build a city which shall be called the new jerusalem and then shall they assist my people that they may be gathered in who are scattered upon all the face
