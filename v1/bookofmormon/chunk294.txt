and now my brethren i would that ye should hear me for i speak in the energy of my soul for behold i have spoken unto you plainly that ye cannot err or have spoken according to the commandments of god for i am called to speak after this manner according to the holy order of god which is in christ jesus yea i am commanded to stand and testify unto this people the things which have been spoken by our fathers concerning the things which are to come and this is not all do ye not suppose that i know of these things myself behold i testify unto you that i do know that these things whereof i have spoken are true and how do ye suppose that i know of their surety behold i say unto you they are made known unto me by the holy spirit of god behold i have fasted and prayed many days that i might know these things of myself and now i do know of myself that they are true for the lord god hath made them manifest unto me by his holy spirit and this is the spirit of revelation which is in me and moreover i say unto you that it has thus been revealed unto me that the words which have been spoken by our fathers are true even so according to the spirit of prophecy which is in me which is also by the manifestation of the spirit of god i say unto you that i know of myself that whatsoever i shall say unto you concerning that which is to come is true and i say unto you that i know that jesus christ shall come yea the son the only begotten of the father full of grace and mercy and truth and behold it is he that cometh to take away the sins of the world yea the sins of every man who steadfastly believeth on his name and now i say unto you that this is the order after which i am called yea to preach unto my beloved brethren yea and every one that dwelleth in the land
