do exist upon the face of the land and there are none that do know the true god save it be the disciples of jesus who did tarry in the land until the wickedness of the people was so great that the lord would not suffer them to remain with the people and whether they be upon the face of the land no man knoweth but behold my father and i have seen them and they have ministered unto us and whoso receiveth this record and shall not condemn it because of the imperfections which are in it the same shall know of greater things than these behold i am moroni and were it possible i would make all things known unto you behold i make an end of speaking concerning this people i am the son of mormon and my father was a descendant of nephi and i am the same who hideth up this record unto the lord the plates thereof are of no worth because of the commandment of the lord for he truly saith that no one shall have them to get gain but the record thereof is of great worth and whoso shall bring it to light him will the lord bless for none can have power to bring it to light save it be given him of god for god wills that it shall be done with an eye single to his glory or the welfare of the ancient and long dispersed covenant people of the lord and blessed be he that shall bring this thing to light for it shall be brought out of darkness unto light according to the word of god yea it shall be brought out of the earth and it shall shine forth out of darkness and come unto the knowledge of the people and it shall be done by the power of god and if there be faults they be the faults of a man but behold we know no fault nevertheless god knoweth all things therefore he that condemneth let him be aware lest he shall be in danger of hell fire and he that saith show unto me or
