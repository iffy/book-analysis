written upon mine other plates and upon these i write the things of my soul and many of the scriptures which are engraven upon the plates of brass for my soul delighteth in the scriptures and my heart pondereth them and writeth them for the learning and the profit of my children behold my soul delighteth in the things of the lord and my heart pondereth continually upon the things which i have seen and heard nevertheless notwithstanding the great goodness of the lord in showing me his great and marvelous works my heart exclaimeth o wretched man that i am yea my heart sorroweth because of my flesh my soul grieveth because of mine iniquities i am encompassed about because of the temptations and the sins which do so easily beset me and when i desire to rejoice my heart groaneth because of my sins nevertheless i know in whom i have trusted my god hath been my support he hath led me through mine afflictions in the wilderness and he hath preserved me upon the waters of the great deep he hath filled me with his love even unto the consuming of my flesh he hath confounded mine enemies unto the causing of them to quake before me behold he hath heard my cry by day and he hath given me knowledge by visions in the nighttime and by day have i waxed bold in mighty prayer before him yea my voice have i sent up on high and angels came down and ministered unto me and upon the wings of his spirit hath my body been carried away upon exceedingly high mountains and mine eyes have beheld great things yea even too great for man therefore i was bidden that i should not write them o then if i have seen so great things if the lord in his condescension unto the children of men hath visited men in so much mercy why should my heart weep and my soul linger in the valley of sorrow and my flesh waste away and my strength slacken because of mine afflictions and why should i yield to sin because of my flesh yea
