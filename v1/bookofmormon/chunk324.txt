after this holy order and were sanctified and their garments were washed white through the blood of the lamb now they after being sanctified by the holy ghost having their garments made white being pure and spotless before god could not look upon sin save it were with abhorrence and there were many exceedingly great many who were made pure and entered into the rest of the lord their god and now my brethren i would that ye should humble yourselves before god and bring forth fruit meet for repentance that ye may also enter into that rest yea humble yourselves even as the people in the days of melchizedek who was also a high priest after this same order which i have spoken who also took upon him the high priesthood forever and it was this same melchizedek to whom abraham paid tithes yea even our father abraham paid tithes of one-tenth part of all he possessed now these ordinances were given after this manner that thereby the people might look forward on the son of god it being a type of his order or it being his order and this that they might look forward to him for a remission of their sins that they might enter into the rest of the lord now this melchizedek was a king over the land of salem and his people had waxed strong in iniquity and abomination yea they had all gone astray they were full of all manner of wickedness but melchizedek having exercised mighty faith and received the office of the high priesthood according to the holy order of god did preach repentance unto his people and behold they did repent and melchizedek did establish peace in the land in his days therefore he was called the prince of peace for he was the king of salem and he did reign under his father now there were many before him and also there were many afterwards but none were greater therefore of him they have more particularly made mention now i need not rehearse the matter what i have said may suffice behold the scriptures are before you if ye will wrest them
