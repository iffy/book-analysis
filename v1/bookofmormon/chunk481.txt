us from the land of zarahemla and thus we were prepared with ten thousand men and provisions for them and also for their wives and their children and the lamanites thus seeing our forces increase daily and provisions arrive for our support they began to be fearful and began to sally forth if it were possible to put an end to our receiving provisions and strength now when we saw that the lamanites began to grow uneasy on this wise we were desirous to bring a stratagem into effect upon them therefore antipus ordered that i should march forth with my little sons to a neighboring city as if we were carrying provisions to a neighboring city and we were to march near the city of antiparah as if we were going to the city beyond in the borders by the seashore and it came to pass that we did march forth as if with our provisions to go to that city and it came to pass that antipus did march forth with a part of his army leaving the remainder to maintain the city but he did not march forth until i had gone forth with my little army and came near the city antiparah and now in the city antiparah were stationed the strongest army of the lamanites yea the most numerous and it came to pass that when they had been informed by their spies they came forth with their army and marched against us and it came to pass that we did flee before them northward and thus we did lead away the most powerful army of the lamanites yea even to a considerable distance insomuch that when they saw the army of antipus pursuing them with their might they did not turn to the right nor to the left but pursued their march in a straight course after us and as we suppose it was their intent to slay us before antipus should overtake them and this that they might not be surrounded by our people and now antipus beholding our danger did speed the march of his army but behold it was night therefore they did not overtake
