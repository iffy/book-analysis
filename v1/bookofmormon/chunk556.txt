and cast him out and seek all manner of ways to destroy him yea you will say that he is a false prophet and that he is a sinner and of the devil because he testifieth that your deeds are evil but behold if a man shall come among you and shall say do this and there is no iniquity do that and ye shall not suffer yea he will say walk after the pride of your own hearts yea walk after the pride of your eyes and do whatsoever your heart desireth and if a man shall come among you and say this ye will receive him and say that he is a prophet yea ye will lift him up and ye will give unto him of your substance ye will give unto him of your gold and of your silver and ye will clothe him with costly apparel and because he speaketh flattering words unto you and he saith that all is well then ye will not find fault with him o ye wicked and ye perverse generation ye hardened and ye stiffnecked people how long will ye suppose that the lord will suffer you yea how long will ye suffer yourselves to be led by foolish and blind guides yea how long will ye choose darkness rather than light yea behold the anger of the lord is already kindled against you behold he hath cursed the land because of your iniquity and behold the time cometh that he curseth your riches that they become slippery that ye cannot hold them and in the days of your poverty ye cannot retain them and in the days of your poverty ye shall cry unto the lord and in vain shall ye cry for your desolation is already come upon you and your destruction is made sure and then shall ye weep and howl in that day saith the lord of hosts and then shall ye lament and say o that i had repented and had not killed the prophets and stoned them and cast them out yea in that day ye shall say o that we had remembered the lord our god
