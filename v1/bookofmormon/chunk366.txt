that they are blessed for they have gone to dwell with their god now when the lamanites saw that their brethren would not flee from the sword neither would they turn aside to the right hand or to the left but that they would lie down and perish and praised god even in the very act of perishing under the sword now when the lamanites saw this they did forbear from slaying them and there were many whose hearts had swollen in them for those of their brethren who had fallen under the sword for they repented of the things which they had done and it came to pass that they threw down their weapons of war and they would not take them again for they were stung for the murders which they had committed and they came down even as their brethren relying upon the mercies of those whose arms were lifted to slay them and it came to pass that the people of god were joined that day by more than the number who had been slain and those who had been slain were righteous people therefore we have no reason to doubt but what they were saved and there was not a wicked man slain among them but there were more than a thousand brought to the knowledge of the truth thus we see that the lord worketh in many ways to the salvation of his people now the greatest number of those of the lamanites who slew so many of their brethren were amalekites and amulonites the greatest number of whom were after the order of the nehors now among those who joined the people of the lord there were none who were amalekites or amulonites or who were of the order of nehor but they were actual descendants of laman and lemuel and thus we can plainly discern that after a people have been once enlightened by the spirit of god and have had great knowledge of things pertaining to righteousness and then have fallen away into sin and transgression they become more hardened and thus their state becomes worse than though they had never known these things alma
