and now behold this is the testimony which is in me now i say unto you that ye must repent and be born again for the spirit saith if ye are not born again ye cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven therefore come and be baptized unto repentance that ye may be washed from your sins that ye may have faith on the lamb of god who taketh away the sins of the world who is mighty to save and to cleanse from all unrighteousness yea i say unto you come and fear not and lay aside every sin which easily doth beset you which doth bind you down to destruction yea come and go forth and show unto your god that ye are willing to repent of your sins and enter into a covenant with him to keep his commandments and witness it unto him this day by going into the waters of baptism and whosoever doeth this and keepeth the commandments of god from thenceforth the same will remember that i say unto him yea he will remember that i have said unto him he shall have eternal life according to the testimony of the holy spirit which testifieth in me and now my beloved brethren do you believe these things behold i say unto you yea i know that ye believe them and the way that i know that ye believe them is by the manifestation of the spirit which is in me and now because your faith is strong concerning that yea concerning the things which i have spoken great is my joy for as i said unto you from the beginning that i had much desire that ye were not in the state of dilemma like your brethren even so i have found that my desires have been gratified for i perceive that ye are in the paths of righteousness i perceive that ye are in the path which leads to the kingdom of god yea i perceive that ye are making his paths straight i perceive that it has been made known unto you by the testimony of his word that he cannot walk in crooked paths neither
