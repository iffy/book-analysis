of middoni to the land of ishmael which was the land of their inheritance and king lamoni would not suffer that ammon should serve him or be his servant but he caused that there should be synagogues built in the land of ishmael and he caused that his people or the people who were under his reign should assemble themselves together and he did rejoice over them and he did teach them many things and he did also declare unto them that they were a people who were under him and that they were a free people that they were free from the oppressions of the king his father for that his father had granted unto him that he might reign over the people who were in the land of ishmael and in all the land round about and he also declared unto them that they might have the liberty of worshiping the lord their god according to their desires in whatsoever place they were in if it were in the land which was under the reign of king lamoni and ammon did preach unto the people of king lamoni and it came to pass that he did teach them all things concerning things pertaining to righteousness and he did exhort them daily with all diligence and they gave heed unto his word and they were zealous for keeping the commandments of god alma chapter now as ammon was thus teaching the people of lamoni continually we will return to the account of aaron and his brethren for after he departed from the land of middoni he was led by the spirit to the land of nephi even to the house of the king which was over all the land save it were the land of ishmael and he was the father of lamoni and it came to pass that he went in unto him into the kings palace with his brethren and bowed himself before the king and said unto him behold o king we are the brethren of ammon whom thou hast delivered out of prison and now o king if thou wilt spare our lives we will be thy servants and
