when jesus had expounded all the scriptures in one which they had written he commanded them that they should teach the things which he had expounded unto them nephi chapter and it came to pass that he commanded them that they should write the words which the father had given unto malachi which he should tell unto them and it came to pass that after they were written he expounded them and these are the words which he did tell unto them saying thus said the father unto malachi behold i will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his temple even the messenger of the covenant whom ye delight in behold he shall come saith the lord of hosts but who may abide the day of his coming and who shall stand when he appeareth for he is like a refiners fire and like fullers soap and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver and he shall purify the sons of levi and purge them as gold and silver that they may offer unto the lord an offering in righteousness then shall the offering of judah and jerusalem be pleasant unto the lord as in the days of old and as in former years and i will come near to you to judgment and i will be a swift witness against the sorcerers and against the adulterers and against false swearers and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages the widow and the fatherless and that turn aside the stranger and fear not me saith the lord of hosts for i am the lord i change not therefore ye sons of jacob are not consumed even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances and have not kept them return unto me and i will return unto you saith the lord of hosts but ye say wherein shall we return will a man rob god yet ye have robbed me but ye say wherein have we robbed thee in tithes and offerings ye are cursed with a curse
