when i shall stand to be judged of god of the things whereof he hath commanded me concerning you i say unto you that i have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together that i might rid my garments of your blood at this period of time when i am about to go down to my grave that i might go down in peace and my immortal spirit may join the choirs above in singing the praises of a just god and moreover i say unto you that i have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together that i might declare unto you that i can no longer be your teacher nor your king for even at this time my whole frame doth tremble exceedingly while attempting to speak unto you but the lord god doth support me and hath suffered me that i should speak unto you and hath commanded me that i should declare unto you this day that my son mosiah is a king and a ruler over you and now my brethren i would that ye should do as ye have hitherto done as ye have kept my commandments and also the commandments of my father and have prospered and have been kept from falling into the hands of your enemies even so if ye shall keep the commandments of my son or the commandments of god which shall be delivered unto you by him ye shall prosper in the land and your enemies shall have no power over you but o my people beware lest there shall arise contentions among you and ye list to obey the evil spirit which was spoken of by my father mosiah for behold there is a wo pronounced upon him who listeth to obey that spirit for if he listeth to obey him and remaineth and dieth in his sins the same drinketh damnation to his own soul for he receiveth for his wages an everlasting punishment having transgressed the law of god contrary to his own knowledge i say unto you that there are not any among you except it be your little children that have not been taught concerning these things
