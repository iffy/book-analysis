this account and now as i said unto you that after king mosiah had done these things he took the plates of brass and all the things which he had kept and conferred them upon alma who was the son of alma yea all the records and also the interpreters and conferred them upon him and commanded him that he should keep and preserve them and also keep a record of the people handing them down from one generation to another even as they had been handed down from the time that lehi left jerusalem mosiah chapter now when mosiah had done this he sent out throughout all the land among all the people desiring to know their will concerning who should be their king and it came to pass that the voice of the people came saying we are desirous that aaron thy son should be our king and our ruler now aaron had gone up to the land of nephi therefore the king could not confer the kingdom upon him neither would aaron take upon him the kingdom neither were any of the sons of mosiah willing to take upon them the kingdom therefore king mosiah sent again among the people yea even a written word sent he among the people and these were the words that were written saying behold o ye my people or my brethren for i esteem you as such i desire that ye should consider the cause which ye are called to consider for ye are desirous to have a king now i declare unto you that he to whom the kingdom doth rightly belong has declined and will not take upon him the kingdom and now if there should be another appointed in his stead behold i fear there would rise contentions among you and who knoweth but what my son to whom the kingdom doth belong should turn to be angry and draw away a part of this people after him which would cause wars and contentions among you which would be the cause of shedding much blood and perverting the way of the lord yea and destroy the souls of many people now i
