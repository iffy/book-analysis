the earth and all things that in them are behold he created adam and by adam came the fall of man and because of the fall of man came jesus christ even the father and the son and because of jesus christ came the redemption of man and because of the redemption of man which came by jesus christ they are brought back into the presence of the lord yea this is wherein all men are redeemed because the death of christ bringeth to pass the resurrection which bringeth to pass a redemption from an endless sleep from which sleep all men shall be awakened by the power of god when the trump shall sound and they shall come forth both small and great and all shall stand before his bar being redeemed and loosed from this eternal band of death which death is a temporal death and then cometh the judgment of the holy one upon them and then cometh the time that he that is filthy shall be filthy still and he that is righteous shall be righteous still he that is happy shall be happy still and he that is unhappy shall be unhappy still and now o all ye that have imagined up unto yourselves a god who can do no miracles i would ask of you have all these things passed of which i have spoken has the end come yet behold i say unto you nay and god has not ceased to be a god of miracles behold are not the things that god hath wrought marvelous in our eyes yea and who can comprehend the marvelous works of god who shall say that it was not a miracle that by his word the heaven and the earth should be and by the power of his word man was created of the dust of the earth and by the power of his word have miracles been wrought and who shall say that jesus christ did not many mighty miracles and there were many mighty miracles wrought by the hands of the apostles and if there were miracles wrought then why has god ceased to be a god
