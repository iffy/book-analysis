of the land in unto the new jerusalem and then shall the power of heaven come down among them and i also will be in the midst and then shall the work of the father commence at that day even when this gospel shall be preached among the remnant of this people verily i say unto you at that day shall the work of the father commence among all the dispersed of my people yea even the tribes which have been lost which the father hath led away out of jerusalem yea the work shall commence among all the dispersed of my people with the father to prepare the way whereby they may come unto me that they may call on the father in my name yea and then shall the work commence with the father among all nations in preparing the way whereby his people may be gathered home to the land of their inheritance and they shall go out from all nations and they shall not go out in haste nor go by flight for i will go before them saith the father and i will be their rearward nephi chapter and then shall that which is written come to pass sing o barren thou that didst not bear break forth into singing and cry aloud thou that didst not travail with child for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife saith the lord enlarge the place of thy tent and let them stretch forth the curtains of thy habitations spare not lengthen thy cords and strengthen thy stakes for thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left and thy seed shall inherit the gentiles and make the desolate cities to be inhabited fear not for thou shalt not be ashamed neither be thou confounded for thou shalt not be put to shame for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth and shalt not remember the reproach of thy youth and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more for thy maker thy husband the lord of hosts is his name and thy redeemer the holy one
