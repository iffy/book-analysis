the righteous which have been put up unto him for them and then o ye gentiles how can ye stand before the power of god except ye shall repent and turn from your evil ways know ye not that ye are in the hands of god know ye not that he hath all power and at his great command the earth shall be rolled together as a scroll therefore repent ye and humble yourselves before him lest he shall come out in justice against you lest a remnant of the seed of jacob shall go forth among you as a lion and tear you in pieces and there is none to deliver mormon chapter and now i finish my record concerning the destruction of my people the nephites and it came to pass that we did march forth before the lamanites and i mormon wrote an epistle unto the king of the lamanites and desired of him that he would grant unto us that we might gather together our people unto the land of cumorah by a hill which was called cumorah and there we could give them battle and it came to pass that the king of the lamanites did grant unto me the thing which i desired and it came to pass that we did march forth to the land of cumorah and we did pitch our tents around about the hill cumorah and it was in a land of many waters rivers and fountains and here we had hope to gain advantage over the lamanites and when three hundred and eighty and four years had passed away we had gathered in all the remainder of our people unto the land of cumorah and it came to pass that when we had gathered in all our people in one to the land of cumorah behold i mormon began to be old and knowing it to be the last struggle of my people and having been commanded of the lord that i should not suffer the records which had been handed down by our fathers which were sacred to fall into the hands of the lamanites for the lamanites would destroy them
