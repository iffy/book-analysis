lehi therefore when zerahemnah saw the men of lehi on the east of the river sidon and the armies of moroni on the west of the river sidon that they were encircled about by the nephites they were struck with terror now moroni when he saw their terror commanded his men that they should stop shedding their blood alma chapter and it came to pass that they did stop and withdrew a pace from them and moroni said unto zerahemnah behold zerahemnah that we do not desire to be men of blood ye know that ye are in our hands yet we do not desire to slay you behold we have not come out to battle against you that we might shed your blood for power neither do we desire to bring any one to the yoke of bondage but this is the very cause for which ye have come against us yea and ye are angry with us because of our religion but now ye behold that the lord is with us and ye behold that he has delivered you into our hands and now i would that ye should understand that this is done unto us because of our religion and our faith in christ and now ye see that ye cannot destroy this our faith now ye see that this is the true faith of god yea ye see that god will support and keep and preserve us so long as we are faithful unto him and unto our faith and our religion and never will the lord suffer that we shall be destroyed except we should fall into transgression and deny our faith and now zerahemnah i command you in the name of that all-powerful god who has strengthened our arms that we have gained power over you by our faith by our religion and by our rites of worship and by our church and by the sacred support which we owe to our wives and our children by that liberty which binds us to our lands and our country yea and also by the maintenance of the sacred word of god to which we owe all our happiness and
