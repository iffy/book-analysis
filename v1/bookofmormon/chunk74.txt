no traveler can return a few more days and i go the way of all the earth but behold the lord hath redeemed my soul from hell i have beheld his glory and i am encircled about eternally in the arms of his love and i desire that ye should remember to observe the statutes and the judgments of the lord behold this hath been the anxiety of my soul from the beginning my heart hath been weighed down with sorrow from time to time for i have feared lest for the hardness of your hearts the lord your god should come out in the fulness of his wrath upon you that ye be cut off and destroyed forever or that a cursing should come upon you for the space of many generations and ye are visited by sword and by famine and are hated and are led according to the will and captivity of the devil o my sons that these things might not come upon you but that ye might be a choice and a favored people of the lord but behold his will be done for his ways are righteousness forever and he hath said that inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land but inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my presence and now that my soul might have joy in you and that my heart might leave this world with gladness because of you that i might not be brought down with grief and sorrow to the grave arise from the dust my sons and be men and be determined in one mind and in one heart united in all things that ye may not come down into captivity that ye may not be cursed with a sore cursing and also that ye may not incur the displeasure of a just god upon you unto the destruction yea the eternal destruction of both soul and body awake my sons put on the armor of righteousness shake off the chains with which ye are bound and come forth out of obscurity and arise from the dust rebel
