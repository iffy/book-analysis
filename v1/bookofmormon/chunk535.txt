yea and ye have great need to marvel yea ye ought to marvel because ye are given away that the devil has got so great hold upon your hearts yea how could you have given way to the enticing of him who is seeking to hurl away your souls down to everlasting misery and endless wo o repent ye repent ye why will ye die turn ye turn ye unto the lord your god why has he forsaken you it is because you have hardened your hearts yea ye will not hearken unto the voice of the good shepherd yea ye have provoked him to anger against you and behold instead of gathering you except ye will repent behold he shall scatter you forth that ye shall become meat for dogs and wild beasts o how could you have forgotten your god in the very day that he has delivered you but behold it is to get gain to be praised of men yea and that ye might get gold and silver and ye have set your hearts upon the riches and the vain things of this world for the which ye do murder and plunder and steal and bear false witness against your neighbor and do all manner of iniquity and for this cause wo shall come unto you except ye shall repent for if ye will not repent behold this great city and also all those great cities which are round about which are in the land of our possession shall be taken away that ye shall have no place in them for behold the lord will not grant unto you strength as he has hitherto done to withstand against your enemies for behold thus saith the lord i will not show unto the wicked of my strength to one more than the other save it be unto those that repent of their sins and hearken unto my words now therefore i would that ye should behold my brethren that it shall be better for the lamanites than for you except ye shall repent for behold they are more righteous than you for they have not sinned against that great knowledge
