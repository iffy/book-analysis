they should be taken and bound and cast into prison and had they been the priests of noah he would have caused that they should be put to death but when he found that they were not but that they were his brethren and had come from the land of zarahemla he was filled with exceedingly great joy now king limhi had sent previous to the coming of ammon a small number of men to search for the land of zarahemla but they could not find it and they were lost in the wilderness nevertheless they did find a land which had been peopled yea a land which was covered with dry bones yea a land which had been peopled and which had been destroyed and they having supposed it to be the land of zarahemla returned to the land of nephi having arrived in the borders of the land not many days before the coming of ammon and they brought a record with them even a record of the people whose bones they had found and it was engraven on plates of ore and now limhi was again filled with joy in learning from the mouth of ammon that king mosiah had a gift from god whereby he could interpret such engravings yea and ammon also did rejoice yet ammon and his brethren were filled with sorrow because so many of their brethren had been slain and also that king noah and his priests had caused the people to commit so many sins and iniquities against god and they also did mourn for the death of abinadi and also for the departure of alma and the people that went with him who had formed a church of god through the strength and power of god and faith on the words which had been spoken by abinadi yea they did mourn for their departure for they knew not whither they had fled now they would have gladly joined with them for they themselves had entered into a covenant with god to serve him and keep his commandments and now since the coming of ammon king limhi had also entered into a covenant with god
