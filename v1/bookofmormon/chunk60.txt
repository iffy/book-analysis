things which transpired before i made these plates are of a truth more particularly made mention upon the first plates and after i had made these plates by way of commandment i nephi received a commandment that the ministry and the prophecies the more plain and precious parts of them should be written upon these plates and that the things which were written should be kept for the instruction of my people who should possess the land and also for other wise purposes which purposes are known unto the lord wherefore i nephi did make a record upon the other plates which gives an account or which gives a greater account of the wars and contentions and destructions of my people and this have i done and commanded my people what they should do after i was gone and that these plates should be handed down from one generation to another or from one prophet to another until further commandments of the lord and an account of my making these plates shall be given hereafter and then behold i proceed according to that which i have spoken and this i do that the more sacred things may be kept for the knowledge of my people nevertheless i do not write anything upon plates save it be that i think it be sacred and now if i do err even did they err of old not that i would excuse myself because of other men but because of the weakness which is in me according to the flesh i would excuse myself for the things which some men esteem to be of great worth both to the body and soul others set at naught and trample under their feet yea even the very god of israel do men trample under their feet i say trample under their feet but i would speak in other words they set him at naught and hearken not to the voice of his counsels and behold he cometh according to the words of the angel in six hundred years from the time my father left jerusalem and the world because of their iniquity shall judge him to be a thing
