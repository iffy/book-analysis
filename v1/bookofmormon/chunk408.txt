yea and from that time even until now i have labored without ceasing that i might bring souls unto repentance that i might bring them to taste of the exceeding joy of which i did taste that they might also be born of god and be filled with the holy ghost yea and now behold o my son the lord doth give me exceedingly great joy in the fruit of my labors for because of the word which he has imparted unto me behold many have been born of god and have tasted as i have tasted and have seen eye to eye as i have seen therefore they do know of these things of which i have spoken as i do know and the knowledge which i have is of god and i have been supported under trials and troubles of every kind yea and in all manner of afflictions yea god has delivered me from prison and from bonds and from death yea and i do put my trust in him and he will still deliver me and i know that he will raise me up at the last day to dwell with him in glory yea and i will praise him forever for he has brought our fathers out of egypt and he has swallowed up the egyptians in the red sea and he led them by his power into the promised land yea and he has delivered them out of bondage and captivity from time to time yea and he has also brought our fathers out of the land of jerusalem and he has also by his everlasting power delivered them out of bondage and captivity from time to time even down to the present day and i have always retained in remembrance their captivity yea and ye also ought to retain in remembrance as i have done their captivity but behold my son this is not all for ye ought to know as i do know that inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of god ye shall prosper in the land and ye ought to know also that inasmuch as ye will not keep the commandments of god
