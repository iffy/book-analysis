the eighty and second year they began again to forget the lord their god and in the eighty and third year they began to wax strong in iniquity and in the eighty and fourth year they did not mend their ways and it came to pass in the eighty and fifth year they did wax stronger and stronger in their pride and in their wickedness and thus they were ripening again for destruction and thus ended the eighty and fifth year helaman chapter and thus we can behold how false and also the unsteadiness of the hearts of the children of men yea we can see that the lord in his great infinite goodness doth bless and prosper those who put their trust in him yea and we may see at the very time when he doth prosper his people yea in the increase of their fields their flocks and their herds and in gold and in silver and in all manner of precious things of every kind and art sparing their lives and delivering them out of the hands of their enemies softening the hearts of their enemies that they should not declare wars against them yea and in fine doing all things for the welfare and happiness of his people yea then is the time that they do harden their hearts and do forget the lord their god and do trample under their feet the holy one yea and this because of their ease and their exceedingly great prosperity and thus we see that except the lord doth chasten his people with many afflictions yea except he doth visit them with death and with terror and with famine and with all manner of pestilence they will not remember him o how foolish and how vain and how evil and devilish and how quick to do iniquity and how slow to do good are the children of men yea how quick to hearken unto the words of the evil one and to set their hearts upon the vain things of the world yea how quick to be lifted up in pride yea how quick to boast and do all manner of that
