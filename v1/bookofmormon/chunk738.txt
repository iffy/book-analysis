all kinds of tongues and again to another the interpretation of languages and of divers kinds of tongues and all these gifts come by the spirit of christ and they come unto every man severally according as he will and i would exhort you my beloved brethren that ye remember that every good gift cometh of christ and i would exhort you my beloved brethren that ye remember that he is the same yesterday today and forever and that all these gifts of which i have spoken which are spiritual never will be done away even as long as the world shall stand only according to the unbelief of the children of men wherefore there must be faith and if there must be faith there must also be hope and if there must be hope there must also be charity and except ye have charity ye can in nowise be saved in the kingdom of god neither can ye be saved in the kingdom of god if ye have not faith neither can ye if ye have no hope and if ye have no hope ye must needs be in despair and despair cometh because of iniquity and christ truly said unto our fathers if ye have faith ye can do all things which are expedient unto me and now i speak unto all the ends of the earth that if the day cometh that the power and gifts of god shall be done away among you it shall be because of unbelief and wo be unto the children of men if this be the case for there shall be none that doeth good among you no not one for if there be one among you that doeth good he shall work by the power and gifts of god and wo unto them who shall do these things away and die for they die in their sins and they cannot be saved in the kingdom of god and i speak it according to the words of christ and i lie not and i exhort you to remember these things for the time speedily cometh that ye shall know that i lie not for
