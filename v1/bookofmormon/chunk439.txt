in their hearts because of their exceedingly great riches therefore they grew rich in their own eyes and would not give heed to their words to walk uprightly before god alma chapter and it came to pass that as many as would not hearken to the words of helaman and his brethren were gathered together against their brethren and now behold they were exceedingly wroth insomuch that they were determined to slay them now the leader of those who were wroth against their brethren was a large and a strong man and his name was amalickiah and amalickiah was desirous to be a king and those people who were wroth were also desirous that he should be their king and they were the greater part of them the lower judges of the land and they were seeking for power and they had been led by the flatteries of amalickiah that if they would support him and establish him to be their king that he would make them rulers over the people thus they were led away by amalickiah to dissensions notwithstanding the preaching of helaman and his brethren yea notwithstanding their exceedingly great care over the church for they were high priests over the church and there were many in the church who believed in the flattering words of amalickiah therefore they dissented even from the church and thus were the affairs of the people of nephi exceedingly precarious and dangerous notwithstanding their great victory which they had had over the lamanites and their great rejoicings which they had had because of their deliverance by the hand of the lord thus we see how quick the children of men do forget the lord their god yea how quick to do iniquity and to be led away by the evil one yea and we also see the great wickedness one very wicked man can cause to take place among the children of men yea we see that amalickiah because he was a man of cunning device and a man of many flattering words that he led away the hearts of many people to do wickedly yea and to seek to destroy the church of god
