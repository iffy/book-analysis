the word of god unto them to stir them up in remembrance of their duty and that he might pull down by the word of god all the pride and craftiness and all the contentions which were among his people seeing no way that he might reclaim them save it were in bearing down in pure testimony against them and thus in the commencement of the ninth year of the reign of the judges over the people of nephi alma delivered up the judgment-seat to nephihah and confined himself wholly to the high priesthood of the holy order of god to the testimony of the word according to the spirit of revelation and prophecy alma chapter now it came to pass that alma began to deliver the word of god unto the people first in the land of zarahemla and from thence throughout all the land and these are the words which he spake to the people in the church which was established in the city of zarahemla according to his own record saying i alma having been consecrated by my father alma to be a high priest over the church of god he having power and authority from god to do these things behold i say unto you that he began to establish a church in the land which was in the borders of nephi yea the land which was called the land of mormon yea and he did baptize his brethren in the waters of mormon and behold i say unto you they were delivered out of the hands of the people of king noah by the mercy and power of god and behold after that they were brought into bondage by the hands of the lamanites in the wilderness yea i say unto you they were in captivity and again the lord did deliver them out of bondage by the power of his word and we were brought into this land and here we began to establish the church of god throughout this land also and now behold i say unto you my brethren you that belong to this church have you sufficiently retained in remembrance the captivity of your fathers
