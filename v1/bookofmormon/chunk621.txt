the light of his countenance did shine upon them and behold they were as white as the countenance and also the garments of jesus and behold the whiteness thereof did exceed all the whiteness yea even there could be nothing upon earth so white as the whiteness thereof and jesus said unto them pray on nevertheless they did not cease to pray and he turned from them again and went a little way off and bowed himself to the earth and he prayed again unto the father saying father i thank thee that thou hast purified those whom i have chosen because of their faith and i pray for them and also for them who shall believe on their words that they may be purified in me through faith on their words even as they are purified in me father i pray not for the world but for those whom thou hast given me out of the world because of their faith that they may be purified in me that i may be in them as thou father art in me that we may be one that i may be glorified in them and when jesus had spoken these words he came again unto his disciples and behold they did pray steadfastly without ceasing unto him and he did smile upon them again and behold they were white even as jesus and it came to pass that he went again a little way off and prayed unto the father and tongue cannot speak the words which he prayed neither can be written by man the words which he prayed and the multitude did hear and do bear record and their hearts were open and they did understand in their hearts the words which he prayed nevertheless so great and marvelous were the words which he prayed that they cannot be written neither can they be uttered by man and it came to pass that when jesus had made an end of praying he came again to the disciples and said unto them so great faith have i never seen among all the jews wherefore i could not show unto them so great miracles
