alone in the world i adopted her and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter she is a sunbeam in my house sweet loving beautiful a wonderful manager and housekeeper yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be she is my right hand i do not know what i could do without her in only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes twice my boy has asked her to marry him for he loves her devotedly but each time she has refused him i think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she and that his marriage might have changed his whole life but now alas it is too late forever too late now mr holmes you know the people who live under my roof
