sir i can stand this strain no longer i shall go mad if it continues i have no one to turn to none save only one who cares for me and he poor fellow can be of little aid i have heard of you mr holmes i have heard of you from mrs farintosh whom you helped in the hour of her sore need it was from her that i had your address oh sir do you not think that you could help me too and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me at present it is out of my power to reward you for your services but in a month or six weeks i shall be married with the control of my own income and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful
