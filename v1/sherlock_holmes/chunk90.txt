oh at his new offices he did tell me the address yes king edward street near st pauls i started off mr holmes but when i got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps and no one in it had ever heard of either mr william morris or mr duncan ross and what did you do then asked holmes i went home to saxe-coburg square and i took the advice of my assistant but he could not help me in any way he could only say that if i waited i should hear by post but that was not quite good enough mr holmes i did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle so as i had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it i
