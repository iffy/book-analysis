that the count does not regret having once deviated from the principles he has so boldly avowed how have i deviated from those principles monsieur asked monte cristo who could not help looking at morrel with so much intensity that two or three times the young man had been unable to sustain that clear and piercing glance why it seems to me replied morrel that in delivering m de morcerf whom you did not know you did good to your neighbor and to society of which he is the brightest ornament said beauchamp drinking off a glass of champagne my dear count cried morcerf you are at fault you one of the most formidable logicians i know and you must see it clearly proved that instead of being an egotist you are a philanthropist ah you call yourself oriental a levantine maltese indian chinese your family name is monte cristo sinbad the sailor is your baptismal appellation and yet the first day you set foot in paris you instinctively display the greatest virtue or rather the chief defect of us eccentric parisians that is you assume the vices you have not and conceal the virtues you possess my dear vicomte returned monte cristo i do not see in all i have done anything that merits either from you or these gentlemen the pretended eulogies i have received you were no stranger to me for i knew you from the time i gave up two rooms to you invited you to breakfast with me lent you one of my carriages witnessed the carnival in your company and saw with you from a window in the piazza del popolo the execution that affected you so much that you nearly fainted i will appeal to any of these gentlemen could i leave my guest in the hands of a hideous bandit as you term him besides you know i had the idea that you could introduce me into some of the paris salons when i came to france you might some time ago have looked upon this resolution as a vague project but today you see it was a reality and you must submit to it under penalty of breaking your word i will keep it returned morcerf but i fear that you will be much disappointed accustomed as you are to picturesque events and fantastic horizons amongst us you will not meet with any of those episodes with which your adventurous existence has so familiarized you our chimborazo is mortmartre our himalaya is mount valrien our great desert is the plain of grenelle where they are now boring an artesian well to water the caravans we have plenty of thieves though not so many as is said but these thieves stand in far more dread of a policeman than a lord france is so prosaic and paris so civilized a city that you will not find in its eighty-five departments i say eighty-five because i do not include corsica you will not find then in these eighty-five departments a single hill on which there is not a telegraph or a grotto in which the commissary of police has not put up a gaslamp there is but one service i can render you and for that i place myself entirely at your orders that is to present or make my friends present you everywhere besides you have no need of anyone to introduce you with your name and your fortune and your talent monte cristo bowed with a somewhat ironical smile you can present yourself everywhere and be well received i can be useful in one way only if knowledge of parisian habits of the means of rendering yourself comfortable or of the bazaars can assist you may depend upon me to find you a fitting dwelling here i do not dare offer to share my apartments with you as i shared yours at rome i who do not profess egotism but am yet egotist par excellence for except myself these rooms would not hold a shadow more unless that shadow were feminine ah said the count that is a most conjugal reservation i recollect that at rome you said something of a projected marriage may i congratulate you the affair is still in projection and he who says in projection means already decided said debray no replied morcerf my father is most anxious about it and i hope ere long to introduce you if not to my wife at least to my betrothed mademoiselle eugnie danglars eugnie danglars said monte cristo tell me is not her father baron danglars yes returned morcerf a baron of a new creation what matter said monte cristo if he has rendered the state services which merit this distinction enormous ones answered beauchamp although in reality a liberal he negotiated a loan of six millions for charles x in who made him a baron and chevalier of the legion of honor so that he wears the ribbon not as you would think in his waistcoat-pocket but at his button-hole ah interrupted morcerf laughing beauchamp beauchamp keep that for the corsaire or the charivari but spare my future father-in-law before me then turning to monte cristo you just now spoke his name as if you knew the baron i do not know him returned monte cristo but i shall probably soon make his acquaintance for i have a credit opened
