the arrival of this answer your father came by the advice of monte cristo to ask my daughters hand for you i decidedly refused him but without any explanation or exposure in short why should i have any more to do with the affair how did the honor or disgrace of m de morcerf affect me it neither increased nor decreased my income albert felt the blood mounting to his brow there was no doubt upon the subject danglars defended himself with the baseness but at the same time with the assurance of a man who speaks the truth at least in part if not wholly not for conscience sake but through fear besides what was morcerf seeking it was not whether danglars or monte cristo was more or less guilty it was a man who would answer for the offence whether trifling or serious it was a man who would fight and it was evident danglars would not fight in addition to this everything forgotten or unperceived before presented itself now to his recollection monte cristo knew everything as he had bought the daughter of ali pasha and knowing everything he had advised danglars to write to yanina the answer known he had yielded to alberts wish to be introduced to hayde and allowed the conversation to turn on the death of ali and had not opposed haydes recital but having doubtless warned the young girl in the few romaic words he spoke to her not to implicate morcerfs father besides had he not begged of morcerf not to mention his fathers name before hayde lastly he had taken albert to normandy when he knew the final blow was near there could be no doubt that all had been calculated and previously arranged monte cristo then was in league with his fathers enemies albert took beauchamp aside and communicated these ideas to him you are right said the latter m danglars has only been a secondary agent in this sad affair and it is of m de monte cristo that you must demand an explanation albert turned sir said he to danglars understand that i do not take a final leave of you i must ascertain if your insinuations are just and am going now to inquire of the count of monte cristo he bowed to the banker and went out with beauchamp without appearing to notice cavalcanti danglars accompanied him to the door where he again assured albert that no motive of personal hatred had influenced him against the count of morcerf chapter the insult at the bankers door beauchamp stopped morcerf listen said he just now i told you it was of m de monte cristo you must demand an explanation yes and we are going to his house reflect morcerf one moment before you go on what shall i reflect on the importance of the step you are taking is it more serious than going to m danglars yes m danglars is a money-lover and those who love money you know think too much of what they risk to be easily induced to fight a duel the other is on the contrary to all appearance a true nobleman but do you not fear to find him a bully i only fear one thing namely to find a man who will not fight do not be alarmed said beauchamp he will meet you my only fear is that he will be too strong for you my friend said morcerf with a sweet smile that is what i wish the happiest thing that could occur to me would be to die in my fathers stead that would save us all your mother would die of grief my poor mother said albert passing his hand across his eyes i know she would but better so than die of shame are you quite decided albert yes let us go but do you think we shall find the count at home he intended returning some hours after me and doubtless he is now at home they ordered the driver to take them to no champs-lyses beauchamp wished to go in alone but albert observed that as this was an unusual circumstance he might be allowed to deviate from the usual etiquette of duels the cause which the young man espoused was one so sacred that beauchamp had only to comply with all his wishes he yielded and contented himself with following morcerf albert sprang from the porters lodge to the steps he was received by baptistin the count had indeed just arrived but he was in his bath and had forbidden that anyone should be admitted but after his bath asked morcerf my master will go to dinner and after dinner he will sleep an hour then he is going to the opera are you sure of it asked albert quite sir my master has ordered his horses at eight oclock precisely very good replied albert that is all i wished to know then turning towards beauchamp if you have anything to attend to beauchamp do it directly if you have any appointment for this evening defer it till tomorrow i depend on you to accompany me to the opera and if you can bring chteau-renaud with you beauchamp availed himself of alberts permission and left him promising to call for him at a quarter before eight on his return home albert expressed
