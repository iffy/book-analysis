astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement with benwick here said he ended the worst of my state for now i could at least put myself in the way of happiness i could exert myself i could do something but to be waiting so long in inaction and waiting only for evil had been dreadful within the first five minutes i said i will be at bath on wednesday and i was was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come and to arrive with some degree of hope you were single it was possible that you might retain the feelings of the past as i did and one encouragement happened to be mine i could never doubt that you would be loved and sought by others but i knew to a certainty that you had refused one man at least of better pretensions than myself and i could not help often saying was this for me their first meeting in milsom street afforded much to be said but the concert still more that evening seemed to be made up of exquisite moments the moment of her stepping forward in the octagon room to speak to him the moment of mr elliot's appearing and tearing her away and one or two subsequent moments marked by returning hope or increasing despondency were dwelt on with energy to see you cried he in the midst of those who could not be my well-wishers to see your cousin close by you conversing and smiling and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match to consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to influence you even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent to consider what powerful supports would be his was it not enough to make the fool of me which i appeared how could i look on without agony was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you was not the recollection of what had been the knowledge of her influence the indelible immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done--was it not all against me you should have distinguished replied anne you should not have suspected me now the case is so different and my age is so different if i was wrong in yielding to persuasion once remember that it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety not of risk when i yielded i thought it was to duty but no duty could be called in aid here in marrying a man indifferent to me all risk would have been incurred and all duty violated perhaps i ought to have reasoned thus he replied but i could not i could not derive benefit from the late knowledge i had acquired of your character i could not bring it into play it was overwhelmed buried lost in those earlier feelings which i had been smarting under year after year i could think of you only as one who had yielded who had given me up who had been influenced by any one rather than by me i saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery i had no reason to believe her of less authority now the force of habit was to be added i should have thought said anne that my manner to yourself might have spared you much or all of this no no your manner might be only the ease which your engagement to another man would give i left you in this belief and yet i was determined to see you again my spirits rallied with the morning and i felt that i had still a motive for remaining here at last anne was at home again and happier than any one in that house could have conceived all the surprise and suspense and every other painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation she re-entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy in some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last an interval of meditation serious and grateful was the best corrective of everything dangerous in such high-wrought felicity and she went to her room and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness of her enjoyment the evening came the drawing-rooms were lighted up the company assembled it was but a card party it was but a mixture of those who had never met before and those who met too often a commonplace business too numerous for intimacy too small for variety but anne had never found an evening shorter glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness and more generally admired than she thought about or cared for she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her mr elliot was there she avoided but she could pity him the wallises she had amusement in understanding them lady dalrymple and miss carteret--they would soon be innoxious cousins to her she cared not for mrs clay and had nothing to blush for in the public manners of her father and sister with the musgroves there was the happy chat of perfect ease with captain harville the kind-hearted intercourse of brother and sister with lady russell attempts at conversation which a delicious consciousness cut short with admiral and mrs croft everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest which the same
