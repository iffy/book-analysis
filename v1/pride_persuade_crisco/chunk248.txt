nay madame i would place each of these heroes on his right pedestal that of robespierre on his scaffold in the place louis quinze that of napoleon on the column of the place vendme the only difference consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated by these two men one is the equality that elevates the other is the equality that degrades one brings a king within reach of the guillotine the other elevates the people to a level with the throne observe said villefort smiling i do not mean to deny that both these men were revolutionary scoundrels and that the th thermidor and the th of april in the year were lucky days for france worthy of being gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil order and that explains how it comes to pass that fallen as i trust he is forever napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical satellites still marquise it has been so with other usurpers cromwell for instance who was not half so bad as napoleon had his partisans and advocates do you know villefort that you are talking in a most dreadfully revolutionary strain but i excuse it it is impossible to expect the son of a girondin to be free from a small spice of the old leaven a deep crimson suffused the countenance of villefort tis true madame answered he that my father was a girondin but he was not among the number of those who voted for the kings death he was an equal sufferer with yourself during the reign of terror and had well-nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father perished true replied the marquise without wincing in the slightest degree at the tragic remembrance thus called up but bear in mind if you please that our respective parents underwent persecution and proscription from diametrically opposite principles in proof of which i may remark that while my family remained among the staunchest adherents of the exiled princes your father lost no time in joining the new government and that while the citizen noirtier was a girondin the count noirtier became a senator dear mother interposed rene you know very well it was agreed that all these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside suffer me also madame replied villefort to add my earnest request to mademoiselle de saint-mrans that you will kindly allow the veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past what avails recrimination over matters wholly past recall for my own part i have laid aside even the name of my father and altogether disown his political principles he was nay probably may still be a bonapartist and is called noirtier i on the contrary am a staunch royalist and style myself de villefort let what may remain of revolutionary sap exhaust itself and die away with the old trunk and condescend only to regard the young shoot which has started up at a distance from the parent tree without having the power any more than the wish to separate entirely from the stock from which it sprung bravo villefort cried the marquis excellently well said come now i have hopes of obtaining what i have been for years endeavoring to persuade the marquise to promise namely a perfect amnesty and forgetfulness of the past with all my heart replied the marquise let the past be forever forgotten i promise you it affords me as little pleasure to revive it as it does you all i ask is that villefort will be firm and inflexible for the future in his political principles remember also villefort that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your fealty and strict loyalty and that at our recommendation the king consented to forget the past as i do and here she extended to him her hand as i now do at your entreaty but bear in mind that should there fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the government you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence with rigorous punishment as it is known you belong to a suspected family alas madame returned villefort my profession as well as the times in which we live compels me to be severe i have already successfully conducted several public prosecutions and brought the offenders to merited punishment but we have not done with the thing yet m do you indeed think so inquired the marquise i am at least fearful of it napoleon in the island of elba is too near france and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans marseilles is filled with half-pay officers who are daily under one frivolous pretext or other getting up quarrels with the royalists from hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of persons and assassinations in the lower you have heard perhaps said the comte de salvieux one of m de saint-mrans oldest friends and chamberlain to the comte dartois that the holy alliance purpose removing him from thence yes they were talking about it when we left paris said m de saint-mran and where is it decided to transfer him to saint helena for heavens sake where is that asked the marquise an island situated on the other side of the equator at least two thousand leagues from here replied the count so much the
