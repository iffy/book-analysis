kept in strict solitary confinement and to be closely watched and guarded beneath these lines was written in another hand see note above nothing can be done he compared the writing in the bracket with the writing of the certificate placed beneath morrels petition and discovered that the note in the bracket was the same writing as the certificate that is to say was in villeforts handwriting m as to the note which accompanied this the englishman understood that it might have been added by some inspector who had taken a momentary interest in dants situation but who had from the remarks we have quoted found it impossible to give any effect to the interest he had felt as we have said the inspector from discretion and that he might not disturb the abb farias pupil in his researches had seated himself in a corner and was reading le drapeau blanc he did not see the englishman fold up and place in his pocket the accusation written by danglars under the arbor of la rserve and which had the postmark marseilles th february delivery oclock pm but it must be said that if he had seen it he attached so little importance to this scrap of paper and so much importance to his two hundred thousand francs that he would not have opposed whatever the englishman might do however irregular it might be thanks said the latter closing the register with a slam i have all i want now it is for me to perform my promise give me a simple assignment of your debt acknowledge therein the receipt of the cash and i will hand you over the money he rose gave his seat to m de boville who took it without ceremony and quickly drew up the required assignment while the englishman counted out the bank-notes on the other side of the desk chapter the house of morrel son anyone who had quitted marseilles a few years previously well acquainted with the interior of morrels warehouse and had returned at this date would have found a great change instead of that air of life of comfort and of happiness that permeates a flourishing and prosperous business establishment instead of merry faces at the windows busy clerks hurrying to and fro in the long corridors instead of the court filled with bales of goods re-echoing with the cries and the jokes of porters one would have immediately perceived all aspect of sadness and gloom out of all the numerous clerks that used to fill the deserted corridor and the empty office but two remained one was a young man of three or four-and-twenty who was in love with m morrels daughter and had remained with him in spite of the efforts of his friends to induce him to withdraw the other was an old one-eyed cashier called cocles or cock-eye a nickname given him by the young men who used to throng this vast now almost deserted bee-hive and which had so completely replaced his real name that he would not in all probability have replied to anyone who addressed him by it cocles remained in m morrels service and a most singular change had taken place in his position he had at the same time risen to the rank of cashier and sunk to the rank of a servant he was however the same cocles good patient devoted but inflexible on the subject of arithmetic the only point on which he would have stood firm against the world even against m morrel and strong in the multiplication-table which he had at his fingers ends no matter what scheme or what trap was laid to catch him in the midst of the disasters that befell the house cocles was the only one unmoved but this did not arise from a want of affection on the contrary from a firm conviction like the rats that one by one forsake the doomed ship even before the vessel weighs anchor so all the numerous clerks had by degrees deserted the office and the warehouse cocles had seen them go without thinking of inquiring the cause of their departure everything was as we have said a question of arithmetic to cocles and during twenty years he had always seen all payments made with such exactitude that it seemed as impossible to him that the house should stop payment as it would to a miller that the river that had so long turned his mill should cease to flow nothing had as yet occurred to shake cocles belief the last months payment had been made with the most scrupulous exactitude cocles had detected an overbalance of fourteen sous in his cash and the same evening he had brought them to m morrel who with a melancholy smile threw them into an almost empty drawer saying thanks cocles you are the pearl of cashiers cocles went away perfectly happy for this eulogium of m morrel himself the pearl of the honest men of marseilles flattered him more than a present of fifty crowns but since the end of the month m morrel had passed many an anxious hour in order to meet the payments then due he had collected all his resources and fearing lest the report of his distress should get bruited abroad at marseilles when he was known to be reduced to such an extremity
