and proposed to him to accompany me endeavoring to tempt him by all the promises most likely to dazzle the imagination of a child of twelve he heard me patiently and when i had finished burst out laughing are you mad uncle he called me by this name when he was in good humor do you think i am going to change the life i lead for your mode of existence my agreeable indolence for the hard and precarious toil you impose on yourself exposed to the bitter frost at night and the scorching heat by day compelled to conceal yourself and when you are perceived receive a volley of bullets all to earn a paltry sum why i have as much money as i want mother assunta always furnishes me when i ask for it you see that i should be a fool to accept your offer the arguments and his audacity perfectly stupefied me benedetto rejoined his associates and i saw him from a distance point me out to them as a fool sweet child murmured monte cristo oh had he been my own son replied bertuccio or even my nephew i would have brought him back to the right road for the knowledge that you are doing your duty gives you strength but the idea that i was striking a child whose father i had killed made it impossible for me to punish him i gave my sister who constantly defended the unfortunate boy good advice and as she confessed that she had several times missed money to a considerable amount i showed her a safe place in which to conceal our little treasure for the future my mind was already made up benedetto could read write and cipher perfectly for when the fit seized him he learned more in a day than others in a week my intention was to enter him as a clerk in some ship and without letting him know anything of my plan to convey him some morning on board by this means his future treatment would depend upon his own conduct i set off for france after having fixed upon the plan our cargo was to be landed in the gulf of lyons and this was a difficult thing to do because it was then the year the most perfect tranquillity was restored and the vigilance of the custom-house officers was redoubled and their strictness was increased at this time in consequence of the fair at beaucaire m our expedition made a favorable beginning we anchored our vessel which had a double hold where our goods were concealed amidst a number of other vessels that bordered the banks of the rhne from beaucaire to arles on our arrival we began to discharge our cargo in the night and to convey it into the town by the help of the innkeeper with whom we were connected whether success rendered us imprudent or whether we were betrayed i know not but one evening about five oclock our little cabin-boy came breathlessly to inform us that he had seen a detachment of custom-house officers advancing in our direction it was not their proximity that alarmed us for detachments were constantly patrolling along the banks of the rhne but the care according to the boys account that they took to avoid being seen in an instant we were on the alert but it was too late our vessel was surrounded and amongst the custom-house officers i observed several gendarmes and as terrified at the sight of their uniforms as i was brave at the sight of any other i sprang into the hold opened a port and dropped into the river dived and only rose at intervals to breathe until i reached a ditch that had recently been made from the rhne to the canal that runs from beaucaire to aigues-mortes i was now safe for i could swim along the ditch without being seen and i reached the canal in safety i had designedly taken this direction i have already told your excellency of an innkeeper from nmes who had set up a little tavern on the road from bellegarde to beaucaire yes said monte cristo i perfectly recollect him i think he was your colleague precisely answered bertuccio but he had seven or eight years before this period sold his establishment to a tailor at marseilles who having almost ruined himself in his old trade wished to make his fortune in another of course we made the same arrangements with the new landlord that we had with the old and it was of this man that i intended to ask shelter what was his name inquired the count who seemed to become somewhat interested in bertuccios story gaspard caderousse he had married a woman from the village of carconte and whom we did not know by any other name than that of her village she was suffering from malarial fever and seemed dying by inches as for her husband he was a strapping fellow of forty or five-and-forty who had more than once in time of danger given ample proof of his presence of mind and courage and you say interrupted monte cristo that this took place towards the year your excellency in what month june the beginning or the end the evening of the rd m ah said monte cristo the evening of the
