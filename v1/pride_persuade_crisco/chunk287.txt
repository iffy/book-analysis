me then said the abb as he re-entered the subterranean passage in which he soon disappeared followed by dants chapter the abbs chamber after having passed with tolerable ease through the subterranean passage which however did not admit of their holding themselves erect the two friends reached the further end of the corridor into which the abbs cell opened from that point the passage became much narrower and barely permitted one to creep through on hands and knees the floor of the abbs cell was paved and it had been by raising one of the stones in the most obscure corner that faria had been able to commence the laborious task of which dants had witnessed the completion as he entered the chamber of his friend dants cast around one eager and searching glance in quest of the expected marvels but nothing more than common met his view it is well said the abb we have some hours before us it is now just a quarter past twelve oclock instinctively dants turned round to observe by what watch or clock the abb had been able so accurately to specify the hour look at this ray of light which enters by my window said the abb and then observe the lines traced on the wall well by means of these lines which are in accordance with the double motion of the earth and the ellipse it describes round the sun i am enabled to ascertain the precise hour with more minuteness than if i possessed a watch for that might be broken or deranged in its movements while the sun and earth never vary in their appointed paths this last explanation was wholly lost upon dants who had always imagined from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in the mediterranean that it moved and not the earth a double movement of the globe he inhabited and of which he could feel nothing appeared to him perfectly impossible each word that fell from his companions lips seemed fraught with the mysteries of science as worthy of digging out as the gold and diamonds in the mines of guzerat and golconda which he could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in his earliest youth come said he to the abb i am anxious to see your treasures the abb smiled and proceeding to the disused fireplace raised by the help of his chisel a long stone which had doubtless been the hearth beneath which was a cavity of considerable depth serving as a safe depository of the articles mentioned to dants m what do you wish to see first asked the abb oh your great work on the monarchy of italy faria then drew forth from his hiding-place three or four rolls of linen laid one over the other like folds of papyrus these rolls consisted of slips of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long they were all carefully numbered and closely covered with writing so legible that dants could easily read it as well as make out the sense it being in italian a language he as a provenal perfectly understood there said he there is the work complete i wrote the word finis at the end of the sixty-eighth strip about a week ago i have torn up two of my shirts and as many handkerchiefs as i was master of to complete the precious pages should i ever get out of prison and find in all italy a printer courageous enough to publish what i have composed my literary reputation is forever secured i see answered dants now let me behold the curious pens with which you have written your work look said faria showing to the young man a slender stick about six inches long and much resembling the size of the handle of a fine painting-brush to the end of which was tied by a piece of thread one of those cartilages of which the abb had before spoken to dants it was pointed and divided at the nib like an ordinary pen dants examined it with intense admiration then looked around to see the instrument with which it had been shaped so correctly into form ah yes said faria the penknife thats my masterpiece i made it as well as this larger knife out of an old iron candlestick the penknife was sharp and keen as a razor as for the other knife it would serve a double purpose and with it one could cut and thrust dants examined the various articles shown to him with the same attention that he had bestowed on the curiosities and strange tools exhibited in the shops at marseilles as the works of the savages in the south seas from whence they had been brought by the different trading vessels as for the ink said faria i told you how i managed to obtain that and i only just make it from time to time as i require it one thing still puzzles me observed dants and that is how you managed to do all this by daylight i worked at night also replied faria night why for heavens sake are your eyes like cats that you can see to work in the dark indeed they are not but god has supplied man with the intelligence that enables him to overcome the limitations of natural
