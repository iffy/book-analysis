gay smiling and joyful maximilian cast a look of disdain almost of anger on the count we must leave you said monte cristo m before you quit us count said julie will you permit us to express to you all that the other day madame interrupted the count taking her two hands in his all that you could say in words would never express what i read in your eyes the thoughts of your heart are fully understood by mine like benefactors in romances i should have left you without seeing you again but that would have been a virtue beyond my strength because i am a weak and vain man fond of the tender kind and thankful glances of my fellow-creatures on the eve of departure i carry my egotism so far as to say do not forget me my kind friends for probably you will never see me again never see you again exclaimed emmanuel while two large tears rolled down julies cheeks never behold you again it is not a man then but some angel that leaves us and this angel is on the point of returning to heaven after having appeared on earth to do good say not so quickly returned monte cristo say not so my friends angels never err celestial beings remain where they wish to be fate is not more powerful than they it is they who on the contrary overcome fate no emmanuel i am but a man and your admiration is as unmerited as your words are sacrilegious and pressing his lips on the hand of julie who rushed into his arms he extended his other hand to emmanuel then tearing himself from this abode of peace and happiness he made a sign to maximilian who followed him passively with the indifference which had been perceptible in him ever since the death of valentine had so stunned him restore my brother to peace and happiness whispered julie to monte cristo and the count pressed her hand in reply as he had done eleven years before on the staircase leading to morrels study you still confide then in sinbad the sailor asked he smiling oh yes was the ready answer well then sleep in peace and put your trust in the lord as we have before said the post-chaise was waiting four powerful horses were already pawing the ground with impatience while ali apparently just arrived from a long walk was standing at the foot of the steps his face bathed in perspiration well asked the count in arabic have you been to see the old man ali made a sign in the affirmative and have you placed the letter before him as i ordered you to do the slave respectfully signalized that he had and what did he say or rather do ali placed himself in the light so that his master might see him distinctly and then imitating in his intelligent manner the countenance of the old man he closed his eyes as noirtier was in the custom of doing when saying yes good he accepts said monte cristo now let us go m these words had scarcely escaped him when the carriage was on its way and the feet of the horses struck a shower of sparks from the pavement maximilian settled himself in his corner without uttering a word half an hour had passed when the carriage stopped suddenly the count had just pulled the silken check-string which was fastened to alis finger the nubian immediately descended and opened the carriage door it was a lovely starlight night they had just reached the top of the hill villejuif from whence paris appears like a sombre sea tossing its millions of phosphoric waves into light waves indeed more noisy more passionate more changeable more furious more greedy than those of the tempestuous ocean waves which never rest as those of the sea sometimes do waves ever dashing ever foaming ever ingulfing what falls within their grasp the count stood alone and at a sign from his hand the carriage went on for a short distance with folded arms he gazed for some time upon the great city when he had fixed his piercing look on this modern babylon which equally engages the contemplation of the religious enthusiast the materialist and the scoffer great city murmured he inclining his head and joining his hands as if in prayer less than six months have elapsed since first i entered thy gates i believe that the spirit of god led my steps to thee and that he also enables me to quit thee in triumph the secret cause of my presence within thy walls i have confided alone to him who only has had the power to read my heart god only knows that i retire from thee without pride or hatred but not without many regrets he only knows that the power confided to me has never been made subservient to my personal good or to any useless cause oh great city it is in thy palpitating bosom that i have found that which i sought like a patient miner i have dug deep into thy very entrails to root out evil thence now my work is accomplished my mission is terminated now thou canst neither afford me pain nor pleasure adieu paris adieu his look wandered over the vast plain like that
