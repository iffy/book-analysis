tap from without from the sweetest voices or whitest fingers in the world at the end of a long corridor with which the door communicated and which formed the antechamber was on the right alberts breakfast-room looking into the court and on the left the salon looking into the garden shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows and hid from the garden and court these two apartments the only rooms into which as they were on the ground floor the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate on the floor above were similar rooms with the addition of a third formed out of the antechamber these three rooms were a salon a boudoir and a bedroom the salon downstairs was only an algerian divan for the use of smokers the boudoir upstairs communicated with the bedchamber by an invisible door on the staircase it was evident that every precaution had been taken above this floor was a large atelier which had been increased in size by pulling down the partitions a pandemonium in which the artist and the dandy strove for pre-eminence there were collected and piled up all alberts successive caprices hunting-horns bass-viols flutes a whole orchestra for albert had had not a taste but a fancy for music easels palettes brushes pencils for music had been succeeded by painting foils boxing-gloves broadswords and single-sticks for following the example of the fashionable young men of the time albert de morcerf cultivated with far more perseverance than music and drawing the three arts that complete a dandys education ie fencing boxing and single-stick and it was here that he received grisier cooks and charles leboucher the rest of the furniture of this privileged apartment consisted of old cabinets filled with chinese porcelain and japanese vases lucca della robbia faences and palissy platters of old armchairs in which perhaps had sat henry iv or sully louis xiii or richelieu for two of these armchairs adorned with a carved shield on which were engraved the fleur-de-lis of france on an azure field evidently came from the louvre or at least some royal residence over these dark and sombre chairs were thrown splendid stuffs dyed beneath persias sun or woven by the fingers of the women of calcutta or of chandernagor what these stuffs did there it was impossible to say they awaited while gratifying the eyes a destination unknown to their owner himself in the meantime they filled the place with their golden and silky reflections in the centre of the room was a roller and blanchet baby grand piano in rosewood but holding the potentialities of an orchestra in its narrow and sonorous cavity and groaning beneath the weight of the chefs-duvre of beethoven weber mozart haydn grtry and porpora on the walls over the doors on the ceiling were swords daggers malay creeses maces battle-axes gilded damasked and inlaid suits of armor dried plants minerals and stuffed birds their flame-colored wings outspread in motionless flight and their beaks forever open this was alberts favorite lounging place however the morning of the appointment the young man had established himself in the small salon downstairs there on a table surrounded at some distance by a large and luxurious divan every species of tobacco known from the yellow tobacco of petersburg to the black of sinai and so on along the scale from maryland and porto rico to latakia was exposed in pots of crackled earthenware of which the dutch are so fond beside them in boxes of fragrant wood were ranged according to their size and quality puros regalias havanas and manillas and in an open cabinet a collection of german pipes of chibouques with their amber mouth-pieces ornamented with coral and of narghiles with their long tubes of morocco awaiting the caprice or the sympathy of the smokers albert had himself presided at the arrangement or rather the symmetrical derangement which after coffee the guests at a breakfast of modern days love to contemplate through the vapor that escapes from their mouths and ascends in long and fanciful wreaths to the ceiling at a quarter to ten a valet entered he composed with a little groom named john and who only spoke english all alberts establishment although the cook of the hotel was always at his service and on great occasions the counts chasseur also this valet whose name was germain and who enjoyed the entire confidence of his young master held in one hand a number of papers and in the other a packet of letters which he gave to albert albert glanced carelessly at the different missives selected two written in a small and delicate hand and enclosed in scented envelopes opened them and perused their contents with some attention how did these letters come said he one by the post madame danglars footman left the other let madame danglars know that i accept the place she offers me in her box wait then during the day tell rosa that when i leave the opera i will sup with her as she wishes take her six bottles of different wine
