the other by entreating you to keep your promise on that score danglars did not answer have you so soon changed your mind added morcerf or have you only provoked my request that you may have the pleasure of seeing me humbled danglars seeing that if he continued the conversation in the same tone in which he had begun it the whole thing might turn out to his own disadvantage turned to morcerf and said count you must doubtless be surprised at my reserve and i assure you it costs me much to act in such a manner towards you but believe me when i say that imperative necessity has imposed the painful task upon me these are all so many empty words my dear sir said morcerf they might satisfy a new acquaintance but the comte de morcerf does not rank in that list and when a man like him comes to another recalls to him his plighted word and this man fails to redeem the pledge he has at least a right to exact from him a good reason for so doing danglars was a coward but did not wish to appear so he was piqued at the tone which morcerf had just assumed i am not without a good reason for my conduct replied the banker what do you mean to say i mean to say that i have a good reason but that it is difficult to explain you must be aware at all events that it is impossible for me to understand motives before they are explained to me but one thing at least is clear which is that you decline allying yourself with my family no sir said danglars i merely suspend my decision that is all and do you really flatter yourself that i shall yield to all your caprices and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received into your good graces then count if you will not wait we must look upon these projects as if they had never been entertained the count bit his lips till the blood almost started to prevent the ebullition of anger which his proud and irritable temper scarcely allowed him to restrain understanding however that in the present state of things the laugh would decidedly be against him he turned from the door towards which he had been directing his steps and again confronted the banker a cloud settled on his brow evincing decided anxiety and uneasiness instead of the expression of offended pride which had lately reigned there my dear danglars said morcerf we have been acquainted for many years and consequently we ought to make some allowance for each others failings you owe me an explanation and really it is but fair that i should know what circumstance has occurred to deprive my son of your favor it is from no personal ill-feeling towards the viscount that is all i can say sir replied danglars who resumed his insolent manner as soon as he perceived that morcerf was a little softened and calmed down and towards whom do you bear this personal ill-feeling then said morcerf turning pale with anger the expression of the counts face had not remained unperceived by the banker he fixed on him a look of greater assurance than before and said you may perhaps be better satisfied that i should not go farther into particulars a tremor of suppressed rage shook the whole frame of the count and making a violent effort over himself he said i have a right to insist on your giving me an explanation is it madame de morcerf who has displeased you is it my fortune which you find insufficient is it because my opinions differ from yours nothing of the kind sir replied danglars if such had been the case i only should have been to blame inasmuch as i was aware of all these things when i made the engagement no do not seek any longer to discover the reason i really am quite ashamed to have been the cause of your undergoing such severe self-examination let us drop the subject and adopt the middle course of delay which implies neither a rupture nor an engagement ma foi there is no hurry my daughter is only seventeen years old and your son twenty-one while we wait time will be progressing events will succeed each other things which in the evening look dark and obscure appear but too clearly in the light of morning and sometimes the utterance of one word or the lapse of a single day will reveal the most cruel calumnies calumnies did you say sir cried morcerf turning livid with rage does anyone dare to slander me monsieur i told you that i considered it best to avoid all explanation then sir i am patiently to submit to your refusal yes sir although i assure you the refusal is as painful for me to give as it is for you to receive for i had reckoned on the honor of your alliance and the breaking off of a marriage contract always injures the lady more than the gentleman enough sir said morcerf we will speak no more on the subject and clutching his gloves in anger he left the apartment danglars observed that during the whole conversation morcerf had never once dared to ask if it was on
