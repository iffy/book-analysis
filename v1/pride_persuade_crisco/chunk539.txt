rue gungaud she called a cab and directed the driver to go to the rue de harlay as soon as she was seated in the vehicle she drew from her pocket a very thick black veil which she tied on to her straw bonnet she then replaced the bonnet and saw with pleasure in a little pocket-mirror that her white complexion and brilliant eyes were alone visible the cab crossed the pont-neuf and entered the rue de harlay by the place dauphine the driver was paid as the door opened and stepping lightly up the stairs madame danglars soon reached the salle des pas-perdus there was a great deal going on that morning and many business-like persons at the palais business-like persons pay very little attention to women and madame danglars crossed the hall without exciting any more attention than any other woman calling upon her lawyer there was a great press of people in m de villeforts antechamber but madame danglars had no occasion even to pronounce her name the instant she appeared the door-keeper rose came to her and asked her whether she was not the person with whom the procureur had made an appointment and on her affirmative answer being given he conducted her by a private passage to m de villeforts office the magistrate was seated in an armchair writing with his back towards the door he did not move as he heard it open and the door-keeper pronounce the words walk in madame and then reclose it but no sooner had the mans footsteps ceased than he started up drew the bolts closed the curtains and examined every corner of the room then when he had assured himself that he could neither be seen nor heard and was consequently relieved of doubts he said thanks madame thanks for your punctuality and he offered a chair to madame danglars which she accepted for her heart beat so violently that she felt nearly suffocated m it is a long time madame said the procureur describing a half-circle with his chair so as to place himself exactly opposite to madame danglars it is a long time since i had the pleasure of speaking alone with you and i regret that we have only now met to enter upon a painful conversation nevertheless sir you see i have answered your first appeal although certainly the conversation must be much more painful for me than for you villefort smiled bitterly it is true then he said rather uttering his thoughts aloud than addressing his companion it is true then that all our actions leave their traces some sad others bright on our paths it is true that every step in our lives is like the course of an insect on the sands it leaves its track alas to many the path is traced by tears sir said madame danglars you can feel for my emotion can you not spare me then i beseech you when i look at this room whence so many guilty creatures have departed trembling and ashamed when i look at that chair before which i now sit trembling and ashamed oh it requires all my reason to convince me that i am not a very guilty woman and you a menacing judge villefort dropped his head and sighed and i he said i feel that my place is not in the judges seat but on the prisoners bench m you said madame danglars yes i i think sir you exaggerate your situation said madame danglars whose beautiful eyes sparkled for a moment the paths of which you were just speaking have been traced by all young men of ardent imaginations besides the pleasure there is always remorse from the indulgence of our passions and after all what have you men to fear from all this the world excuses and notoriety ennobles you madame replied villefort you know that i am no hypocrite or at least that i never deceive without a reason if my brow be severe it is because many misfortunes have clouded it if my heart be petrified it is that it might sustain the blows it has received i was not so in my youth i was not so on the night of the betrothal when we were all seated around a table in the rue du cours at marseilles but since then everything has changed in and about me i am accustomed to brave difficulties and in the conflict to crush those who by their own free will or by chance voluntarily or involuntarily interfere with me in my career it is generally the case that what we most ardently desire is as ardently withheld from us by those who wish to obtain it or from whom we attempt to snatch it thus the greater number of a mans errors come before him disguised under the specious form of necessity then after error has been committed in a moment of excitement of delirium or of fear we see that we might have avoided and escaped it the means we might have used which we in our blindness could not see then seem simple and easy and we say why did i not do this instead of that women on the contrary are rarely tormented with remorse for the decision does not come from you your misfortunes are generally imposed upon you and your faults
