of one of the descendants of marius and the gracchi whom we noticed at the beginning of the chapter who immediately ran down the road leading to the capitol at his fullest speed danglars was tired and sleepy he therefore went to bed placing his pocketbook under his pillow peppino had a little spare time so he had a game of morra with the facchini lost three crowns and then to console himself drank a bottle of orvieto the next morning danglars awoke late though he went to bed so early he had not slept well for five or six nights even if he had slept at all he breakfasted heartily and caring little as he said for the beauties of the eternal city ordered post-horses at noon but danglars had not reckoned upon the formalities of the police and the idleness of the posting-master the horses only arrived at two oclock and the cicerone did not bring the passport till three all these preparations had collected a number of idlers round the door of signor pastrinis the descendants of marius and the gracchi were also not wanting the baron walked triumphantly through the crowd who for the sake of gain styled him your excellency as danglars had hitherto contented himself with being called a baron he felt rather flattered at the title of excellency and distributed a dozen silver coins among the beggars who were ready for twelve more to call him your highness which road asked the postilion in italian the ancona road replied the baron signor pastrini interpreted the question and answer and the horses galloped off danglars intended travelling to venice where he would receive one part of his fortune and then proceeding to vienna where he would find the rest he meant to take up his residence in the latter town which he had been told was a city of pleasure he had scarcely advanced three leagues out of rome when daylight began to disappear danglars had not intended starting so late or he would have remained he put his head out and asked the postilion how long it would be before they reached the next town non capisco do not understand was the reply danglars bent his head which he meant to imply very well the carriage again moved on i will stop at the first posting-house said danglars to himself he still felt the same self-satisfaction which he had experienced the previous evening and which had procured him so good a nights rest he was luxuriously stretched in a good english calash with double springs he was drawn by four good horses at full gallop he knew the relay to be at a distance of seven leagues what subject of meditation could present itself to the banker so fortunately become bankrupt danglars thought for ten minutes about his wife in paris another ten minutes about his daughter travelling with mademoiselle darmilly the same period was given to his creditors and the manner in which he intended spending their money and then having no subject left for contemplation he shut his eyes and fell asleep now and then a jolt more violent than the rest caused him to open his eyes then he felt that he was still being carried with great rapidity over the same country thickly strewn with broken aqueducts which looked like granite giants petrified while running a race but the night was cold dull and rainy and it was much more pleasant for a traveller to remain in the warm carriage than to put his head out of the window to make inquiries of a postilion whose only answer was non capisco m danglars therefore continued to sleep saying to himself that he would be sure to awake at the posting-house the carriage stopped danglars fancied that they had reached the long-desired point he opened his eyes and looked through the window expecting to find himself in the midst of some town or at least village but he saw nothing except what seemed like a ruin where three or four men went and came like shadows danglars waited a moment expecting the postilion to come and demand payment with the termination of his stage he intended taking advantage of the opportunity to make fresh inquiries of the new conductor but the horses were unharnessed and others put in their places without anyone claiming money from the traveller danglars astonished opened the door but a strong hand pushed him back and the carriage rolled on the baron was completely roused eh he said to the postilion eh mio caro this was another little piece of italian the baron had learned from hearing his daughter sing italian duets with cavalcanti but mio caro did not reply danglars then opened the window come my friend he said thrusting his hand through the opening where are we going dentro la testa answered a solemn and imperious voice accompanied by a menacing gesture danglars thought dentro la testa meant put in your head he was making rapid progress in italian he obeyed not without some uneasiness which momentarily increasing caused his mind instead of being as unoccupied as it was when he began his journey to fill with ideas which were very likely to keep a traveller awake more especially one in such a situation as danglars his eyes acquired that quality which in the first moment
