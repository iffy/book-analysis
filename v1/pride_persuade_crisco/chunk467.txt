he saluted the count with the air of a man who is aware of the rank of his guest then after having led monte cristo around the little garden he returned to the house a large vase of japan porcelain filled with flowers that loaded the air with their perfume stood in the salon julie suitably dressed and her hair arranged she had accomplished this feat in less than ten minutes received the count on his entrance the songs of the birds were heard in an aviary hard by and the branches of laburnums and rose acacias formed an exquisite framework to the blue velvet curtains everything in this charming retreat from the warble of the birds to the smile of the mistress breathed tranquillity and repose the count had felt the influence of this happiness from the moment he entered the house and he remained silent and pensive forgetting that he was expected to renew the conversation which had ceased after the first salutations had been exchanged the silence became almost painful when by a violent effort tearing himself from his pleasing reverie madame said he at length i pray you to excuse my emotion which must astonish you who are only accustomed to the happiness i meet here but contentment is so new a sight to me that i could never be weary of looking at yourself and your husband we are very happy monsieur replied julie but we have also known unhappiness and few have ever undergone more bitter sufferings than ourselves the counts features displayed an expression of the most intense curiosity oh all this is a family history as chteau-renaud told you the other day observed maximilian this humble picture would have but little interest for you accustomed as you are to behold the pleasures and the misfortunes of the wealthy and industrious but such as we are we have experienced bitter sorrows and god has poured balm into your wounds as he does into those of all who are in affliction said monte cristo inquiringly yes count returned julie we may indeed say he has for he has done for us what he grants only to his chosen he sent us one of his angels the counts cheeks became scarlet and he coughed in order to have an excuse for putting his handkerchief to his mouth those born to wealth and who have the means of gratifying every wish said emmanuel know not what is the real happiness of life just as those who have been tossed on the stormy waters of the ocean on a few frail planks can alone realize the blessings of fair weather monte cristo rose and without making any answer for the tremulousness of his voice would have betrayed his emotion walked up and down the apartment with a slow step our magnificence makes you smile count said maximilian who had followed him with his eyes no no returned monte cristo pale as death pressing one hand on his heart to still its throbbings while with the other he pointed to a crystal cover beneath which a silken purse lay on a black velvet cushion i was wondering what could be the significance of this purse with the paper at one end and the large diamond at the other count replied maximilian with an air of gravity those are our most precious family treasures the stone seems very brilliant answered the count oh my brother does not allude to its value although it has been estimated at francs he means that the articles contained in this purse are the relics of the angel i spoke of just now this i do not comprehend and yet i may not ask for an explanation madame replied monte cristo bowing pardon me i had no intention of committing an indiscretion indiscretion oh you make us happy by giving us an excuse for expatiating on this subject if we wanted to conceal the noble action this purse commemorates we should not expose it thus to view oh would we could relate it everywhere and to everyone so that the emotion of our unknown benefactor might reveal his presence ah really said monte cristo in a half-stifled voice monsieur returned maximilian raising the glass cover and respectfully kissing the silken purse this has touched the hand of a man who saved my father from suicide us from ruin and our name from shame and disgrace a man by whose matchless benevolence we poor children doomed to want and wretchedness can at present hear everyone envying our happy lot this letter as he spoke maximilian drew a letter from the purse and gave it to the count this letter was written by him the day that my father had taken a desperate resolution and this diamond was given by the generous unknown to my sister as her dowry monte cristo opened the letter and read it with an indescribable feeling of delight it was the letter written as our readers know to julie and signed sinbad the sailor unknown you say is the man who rendered you this service unknown to you yes we have never had the happiness of pressing his hand continued maximilian we have supplicated heaven in vain to grant us this favor but the whole affair has had a mysterious meaning that we cannot comprehend we have been guided by an invisible hand
