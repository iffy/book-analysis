endeavoring to calm his fears and instead of dwelling upon the political future that had so often been the subject of his ambitious dreams was imagining a future limited to the enjoyments of home in fear of awakening the enemy that had so long slept the noise of a carriage sounded in the yard then he heard the steps of an aged person ascending the stairs followed by tears and lamentations such as servants always give vent to when they wish to appear interested in their masters grief he drew back the bolt of his door and almost directly an old lady entered unannounced carrying her shawl on her arm and her bonnet in her hand the white hair was thrown back from her yellow forehead and her eyes already sunken by the furrows of age now almost disappeared beneath the eyelids swollen with grief oh sir she said oh sir what a misfortune i shall die of it oh yes i shall certainly die of it and then falling upon the chair nearest the door she burst into a paroxysm of sobs the servants standing in the doorway not daring to approach nearer were looking at noirtiers old servant who had heard the noise from his masters room and run there also remaining behind the others villefort rose and ran towards his mother-in-law for it was she why what can have happened he exclaimed what has thus disturbed you is m de saint-mran with you m de saint-mran is dead answered the old marchioness without preface and without expression she appeared to be stupefied villefort drew back and clasping his hands together exclaimed dead so suddenly a week ago continued madame de saint-mran we went out together in the carriage after dinner m de saint-mran had been unwell for some days still the idea of seeing our dear valentine again inspired him with courage and notwithstanding his illness he would leave at six leagues from marseilles after having eaten some of the lozenges he is accustomed to take he fell into such a deep sleep that it appeared to me unnatural still i hesitated to wake him although i fancied that his face was flushed and that the veins of his temples throbbed more violently than usual however as it became dark and i could no longer see i fell asleep i was soon aroused by a piercing shriek as from a person suffering in his dreams and he suddenly threw his head back violently i called the valet i stopped the postilion i spoke to m de saint-mran i applied my smelling-salts but all was over and i arrived at aix by the side of a corpse villefort stood with his mouth half open quite stupefied of course you sent for a doctor immediately but as i have told you it was too late yes but then he could tell of what complaint the poor marquis had died oh yes sir he told me it appears to have been an apoplectic stroke and what did you do then m de saint-mran had always expressed a desire in case his death happened during his absence from paris that his body might be brought to the family vault i had him put into a leaden coffin and i am preceding him by a few days oh my poor mother said villefort to have such duties to perform at your age after such a blow god has supported me through all and then my dear marquis he would certainly have done everything for me that i performed for him it is true that since i left him i seem to have lost my senses i cannot cry at my age they say that we have no more tears still i think that when one is in trouble one should have the power of weeping where is valentine sir it is on her account i am here i wish to see valentine m villefort thought it would be terrible to reply that valentine was at a ball so he only said that she had gone out with her step-mother and that she should be fetched this instant sir this instant i beseech you said the old lady villefort placed the arm of madame de saint-mran within his own and conducted her to his apartment rest yourself mother he said the marchioness raised her head at this word and beholding the man who so forcibly reminded her of her deeply-regretted child who still lived for her in valentine she felt touched at the name of mother and bursting into tears she fell on her knees before an armchair where she buried her venerable head villefort left her to the care of the women while old barrois ran half-scared to his master for nothing frightens old people so much as when death relaxes its vigilance over them for a moment in order to strike some other old person then while madame de saint-mran remained on her knees praying fervently villefort sent for a cab and went himself to fetch his wife and daughter from madame de morcerfs he was so pale when he appeared at the door of the ball-room that valentine ran to him saying oh father some misfortune has happened your grandmamma has just arrived valentine said m de villefort and grandpapa inquired the young girl trembling with apprehension m de villefort only replied
