white chapter the fifth of october it was about six oclock in the evening an opal-colored light through which an autumnal sun shed its golden rays descended on the blue ocean the heat of the day had gradually decreased and a light breeze arose seeming like the respiration of nature on awakening from the burning siesta of the south a delicious zephyr played along the coasts of the mediterranean and wafted from shore to shore the sweet perfume of plants mingled with the fresh smell of the sea a light yacht chaste and elegant in its form was gliding amidst the first dews of night over the immense lake extending from gibraltar to the dardanelles and from tunis to venice the vessel resembled a swan with its wings opened towards the wind gliding on the water it advanced swiftly and gracefully leaving behind it a glittering stretch of foam by degrees the sun disappeared behind the western horizon but as though to prove the truth of the fanciful ideas in heathen mythology its indiscreet rays reappeared on the summit of every wave as if the god of fire had just sunk upon the bosom of amphitrite who in vain endeavored to hide her lover beneath her azure mantle the yacht moved rapidly on though there did not appear to be sufficient wind to ruffle the curls on the head of a young girl standing on the prow was a tall man of a dark complexion who saw with dilating eyes that they were approaching a dark mass of land in the shape of a cone which rose from the midst of the waves like the hat of a catalan is that monte cristo asked the traveller to whose orders the yacht was for the time submitted in a melancholy voice yes your excellency said the captain we have reached it we have reached it repeated the traveller in an accent of indescribable sadness then he added in a low tone yes that is the haven and then he again plunged into a train of thought the character of which was better revealed by a sad smile than it would have been by tears a few minutes afterwards a flash of light which was extinguished instantly was seen on the land and the sound of firearms reached the yacht your excellency said the captain that was the land signal will you answer yourself what signal the captain pointed towards the island up the side of which ascended a volume of smoke increasing as it rose ah yes he said as if awaking from a dream give it to me the captain gave him a loaded carbine the traveller slowly raised it and fired in the air ten minutes afterwards the sails were furled and they cast anchor about a hundred fathoms from the little harbor the gig was already lowered and in it were four oarsmen and a coxswain the traveller descended and instead of sitting down at the stern of the boat which had been decorated with a blue carpet for his accommodation stood up with his arms crossed the rowers waited their oars half lifted out of the water like birds drying their wings m give way said the traveller the eight oars fell into the sea simultaneously without splashing a drop of water and the boat yielding to the impulsion glided forward in an instant they found themselves in a little harbor formed in a natural creek the boat grounded on the fine sand will your excellency be so good as to mount the shoulders of two of our men they will carry you ashore the young man answered this invitation with a gesture of indifference and stepped out of the boat the sea immediately rose to his waist ah your excellency murmured the pilot you should not have done so our master will scold us for it the young man continued to advance following the sailors who chose a firm footing thirty strides brought them to dry land the young man stamped on the ground to shake off the wet and looked around for someone to show him his road for it was quite dark just as he turned a hand rested on his shoulder and a voice which made him shudder exclaimed good-evening maximilian you are punctual thank you ah is it you count said the young man in an almost joyful accent pressing monte cristos hand with both his own yes you see i am as exact as you are but you are dripping my dear fellow you must change your clothes as calypso said to telemachus come i have a habitation prepared for you in which you will soon forget fatigue and cold monte cristo perceived that the young man had turned around indeed morrel saw with surprise that the men who had brought him had left without being paid or uttering a word already the sound of their oars might be heard as they returned to the yacht oh yes said the count you are looking for the sailors yes i paid them nothing and yet they are gone never mind that maximilian said monte cristo smiling i have made an agreement with the navy that the access to my island shall be free of all charge i have made a bargain morrel looked at the count with surprise count he said you are not
