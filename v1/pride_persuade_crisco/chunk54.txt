pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind he could number the fields in every direction and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump but of all the views which his garden or which the country or kingdom could boast none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house it was a handsome modern building well situated on rising ground from his garden mr collins would have led them round his two meadows but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost turned back and while sir william accompanied him charlotte took her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleased probably to have the opportunity of showing it without her husbands help it was rather small but well built and convenient and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit when mr collins could be forgotten there was really an air of great comfort throughout and by charlottes evident enjoyment of it elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country it was spoken of again while they were at dinner when mr collins joining in observed yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will be delighted with her she is all affability and condescension and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over i have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming we dine at rosings twice every week and are never allowed to walk home her ladyships carriage is regularly ordered for us i should say one of her ladyships carriages for she has several lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed added charlotte and a most attentive neighbour very true my dear that is exactly what i say she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news and telling again what had already been written and when it closed elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlottes degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very well she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass the quiet tenor of their usual employments the vexatious interruptions of mr collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings a lively imagination soon settled it all about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her she opened the door and met maria in the landing place who breathless with agitation cried out oh my dear eliza pray make haste and come into the dining-room for there is such a sight to be seen i will not tell you what it is make haste and come down this moment elizabeth asked questions in vain maria would tell her nothing more and down they ran into the dining-room which fronted the lane in quest of this wonder it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate and is this all cried elizabeth i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter la my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake it is not lady catherine the old lady is mrs jenkinson who lives with them the other is miss de bourgh only look at her she is quite a little creature who would have thought that she could be so thin and small she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind why does she not come in oh charlotte says she hardly ever does it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in i like her appearance said elizabeth struck with other ideas she looks sickly and cross yes she will do for him very well she will make him a very proper wife mr collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies and sir william to elizabeths high diversion was stationed in the doorway in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way at length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on and the others returned into the house mr collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day chapter mr collinss triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete the
