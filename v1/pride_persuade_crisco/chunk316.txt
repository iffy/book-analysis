to go and kill some of the wild goats that were seen springing from rock to rock his wish was construed into a love of sport or a desire for solitude however jacopo insisted on following him and dants did not oppose this fearing if he did so that he might incur distrust scarcely however had they gone a quarter of a league when having killed a kid he begged jacopo to take it to his comrades and request them to cook it and when ready to let him know by firing a gun this and some dried fruits and a flask of monte pulciano was the bill of fare dants went on looking from time to time behind and around about him having reached the summit of a rock he saw a thousand feet beneath him his companions whom jacopo had rejoined and who were all busy preparing the repast which edmonds skill as a marksman had augmented with a capital dish edmond looked at them for a moment with the sad and gentle smile of a man superior to his fellows in two hours time said he these persons will depart richer by fifty piastres each to go and risk their lives again by endeavoring to gain fifty more then they will return with a fortune of six hundred francs and waste this treasure in some city with the pride of sultans and the insolence of nabobs at this moment hope makes me despise their riches which seem to me contemptible yet perchance tomorrow deception will so act on me that i shall on compulsion consider such a contemptible possession as the utmost happiness oh no exclaimed edmond that will not be the wise unerring faria could not be mistaken in this one thing besides it were better to die than to continue to lead this low and wretched life thus dants who but three months before had no desire but liberty had now not liberty enough and panted for wealth the cause was not in dants but in providence who while limiting the power of man has filled him with boundless desires meanwhile by a cleft between two walls of rock following a path worn by a torrent and which in all human probability human foot had never before trod dants approached the spot where he supposed the grottos must have existed keeping along the shore and examining the smallest object with serious attention he thought he could trace on certain rocks marks made by the hand of man time which encrusts all physical substances with its mossy mantle as it invests all things of the mind with forgetfulness seemed to have respected these signs which apparently had been made with some degree of regularity and probably with a definite purpose occasionally the marks were hidden under tufts of myrtle which spread into large bushes laden with blossoms or beneath parasitical lichen so edmond had to separate the branches or brush away the moss to know where the guide-marks were the sight of marks renewed edmond fondest hopes might it not have been the cardinal himself who had first traced them in order that they might serve as a guide for his nephew in the event of a catastrophe which he could not foresee would have been so complete this solitary place was precisely suited to the requirements of a man desirous of burying treasure only might not these betraying marks have attracted other eyes than those for whom they were made and had the dark and wondrous island indeed faithfully guarded its precious secret m it seemed however to edmond who was hidden from his comrades by the inequalities of the ground that at sixty paces from the harbor the marks ceased nor did they terminate at any grotto a large round rock placed solidly on its base was the only spot to which they seemed to lead edmond concluded that perhaps instead of having reached the end of the route he had only explored its beginning and he therefore turned round and retraced his steps meanwhile his comrades had prepared the repast had got some water from a spring spread out the fruit and bread and cooked the kid just at the moment when they were taking the dainty animal from the spit they saw edmond springing with the boldness of a chamois from rock to rock and they fired the signal agreed upon the sportsman instantly changed his direction and ran quickly towards them but even while they watched his daring progress edmonds foot slipped and they saw him stagger on the edge of a rock and disappear they all rushed towards him for all loved edmond in spite of his superiority yet jacopo reached him first he found edmond lying prone bleeding and almost senseless he had rolled down a declivity of twelve or fifteen feet they poured a little rum down his throat and this remedy which had before been so beneficial to him produced the same effect as formerly edmond opened his eyes complained of great pain in his knee a feeling of heaviness in his head and severe pains in his loins they wished to carry him to the shore but when they touched him although under jacopos directions he declared with heavy groans that he could not bear to be moved it may be supposed that dants did not now think
