than the one i offer you you will lose the preference and that will be your fault do not give yourselves the trouble excellency returned signor pastrini with the smile peculiar to the italian speculator when he confesses defeat i will do all i can and i hope you will be satisfied and now we understand each other when do you wish the carriage to be here in an hour in an hour it will be at the door an hour after the vehicle was at the door it was a hack conveyance which was elevated to the rank of a private carriage in honor of the occasion but in spite of its humble exterior the young men would have thought themselves happy to have secured it for the last three days of the carnival excellency cried the cicerone seeing franz approach the window shall i bring the carriage nearer to the palace accustomed as franz was to the italian phraseology his first impulse was to look round him but these words were addressed to him franz was the excellency the vehicle was the carriage and the htel de londres was the palace the genius for laudation characteristic of the race was in that phrase franz and albert descended the carriage approached the palace their excellencies stretched their legs along the seats the cicerone sprang into the seat behind where do your excellencies wish to go asked he to saint peters first and then to the colosseum returned albert but albert did not know that it takes a day to see saint peters and a month to study it the day was passed at saint peters alone suddenly the daylight began to fade away franz took out his watch it was half-past four they returned to the hotel at the door franz ordered the coachman to be ready at eight he wished to show albert the colosseum by moonlight as he had shown him saint peters by daylight when we show a friend a city one has already visited we feel the same pride as when we point out a woman whose lover we have been he was to leave the city by the porta del popolo skirt the outer wall and re-enter by the porta san giovanni thus they would behold the colosseum without finding their impressions dulled by first looking on the capitol the forum the arch of septimus severus the temple of antoninus and faustina and the via sacra they sat down to dinner signor pastrini had promised them a banquet he gave them a tolerable repast at the end of the dinner he entered in person franz thought that he came to hear his dinner praised and began accordingly but at the first words he was interrupted excellency said pastrini i am delighted to have your approbation but it was not for that i came did you come to tell us you have procured a carriage asked albert lighting his cigar no and your excellencies will do well not to think of that any longer at rome things can or cannot be done when you are told anything cannot be done there is an end of it it is much more convenient at paris when anything cannot be done you pay double and it is done directly that is what all the french say returned signor pastrini somewhat piqued for that reason i do not understand why they travel but said albert emitting a volume of smoke and balancing his chair on its hind legs only madmen or blockheads like us ever do travel men in their senses do not quit their hotel in the rue du helder their walk on the boulevard de gand and the caf de paris it is of course understood that albert resided in the aforesaid street appeared every day on the fashionable walk and dined frequently at the only restaurant where you can really dine that is if you are on good terms with its waiters signor pastrini remained silent a short time it was evident that he was musing over this answer which did not seem very clear but said franz in his turn interrupting his hosts meditations you had some motive for coming here may i beg to know what it was m ah yes you have ordered your carriage at eight oclock precisely i have you intend visiting il colosseo you mean the colosseum it is the same thing you have told your coachman to leave the city by the porta del popolo to drive round the walls and re-enter by the porta san giovanni these are my words exactly well this route is impossible impossible very dangerous to say the least dangerous and why on account of the famous luigi vampa pray who may this famous luigi vampa be inquired albert he may be very famous at rome but i can assure you he is quite unknown at paris what do you not know him i have not that honor you have never heard his name never well then he is a bandit compared to whom the decesaris and the gasparones were mere children now then albert cried franz here is a bandit for you at last i forewarn you signor pastrini that i shall not believe one word of what you are going to tell us having told you this begin once upon a time well go
