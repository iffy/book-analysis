i am to do for m cavalcanti give him money if he is recommended to you and the recommendation seems good excellent he presented himself this morning with a bond of francs payable at sight on you signed by busoni and returned by you to me with your endorsement of course i immediately counted him over the forty bank-notes monte cristo nodded his head in token of assent but that is not all continued danglars he has opened an account with my house for his son may i ask how much he allows the young man five thousand francs per month sixty thousand francs per year i thought i was right in believing that cavalcanti to be a stingy fellow how can a young man live upon francs a month but you understand that if the young man should want a few thousands more do not advance it the father will never repay it you do not know these ultramontane millionaires they are regular misers and by whom were they recommended to you oh by the house of fenzi one of the best in florence i do not mean to say you will lose but nevertheless mind you hold to the terms of the agreement would you not trust the cavalcanti i oh i would advance ten millions on his signature i was only speaking in reference to the second-rate fortunes we were mentioning just now and with all this how unassuming he is i should never have taken him for anything more than a mere major and you would have flattered him for certainly as you say he has no manner the first time i saw him he appeared to me like an old lieutenant who had grown mouldy under his epaulets but all the italians are the same they are like old jews when they are not glittering in oriental splendor the young man is better said danglars yes a little nervous perhaps but upon the whole he appeared tolerable i was uneasy about him why because you met him at my house just after his introduction into the world as they told me he has been travelling with a very severe tutor and had never been to paris before ah i believe noblemen marry amongst themselves do they not asked danglars carelessly they like to unite their fortunes it is usual certainly but cavalcanti is an original who does nothing like other people i cannot help thinking that he has brought his son to france to choose a wife do you think so i am sure of it and you have heard his fortune mentioned nothing else was talked of only some said he was worth millions and others that he did not possess a farthing and what is your opinion i ought not to influence you because it is only my own personal impression well and it is that my opinion is that all these old podests these ancient condottieri for the cavalcanti have commanded armies and governed provinces my opinion i say is that they have buried their millions in corners the secret of which they have transmitted only to their eldest sons who have done the same from generation to generation and the proof of this is seen in their yellow and dry appearance like the florins of the republic which from being constantly gazed upon have become reflected in them certainly said danglars and this is further supported by the fact of their not possessing an inch of land very little at least i know of none which cavalcanti possesses excepting his palace in lucca ah he has a palace said danglars laughing come that is something yes and more than that he lets it to the minister of finance while he lives in a simple house oh as i told you before i think the old fellow is very close come you do not flatter him i scarcely know him i think i have seen him three times in my life all i know relating to him is through busoni and himself he was telling me this morning that tired of letting his property lie dormant in italy which is a dead nation he wished to find a method either in france or england of multiplying his millions but remember that though i place great confidence in busoni i am not responsible for this never mind accept my thanks for the client you have sent me it is a fine name to inscribe on my ledgers and my cashier was quite proud of it when i explained to him who the cavalcanti were by the way this is merely a simple question when this sort of people marry their sons do they give them any fortune oh that depends upon circumstances i know an italian prince rich as a gold mine one of the noblest families in tuscany who when his sons married according to his wish gave them millions and when they married against his consent merely allowed them thirty crowns a month should andrea marry according to his fathers views he will perhaps give him one two or three millions for example supposing it were the daughter of a banker he might take an interest in the house of the father-in-law of his son then again if he disliked his choice the major takes the key double-locks his coffer and master andrea
