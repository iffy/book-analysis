me shudder and one day when we were viewing an execution i thought i should faint more from hearing the cold and calm manner in which he spoke of every description of torture than from the sight of the executioner and the culprit did he not conduct you to the ruins of the colosseum and suck your blood asked beauchamp or having delivered you make you sign a flaming parchment surrendering your soul to him as esau did his birth-right rail on rail on at your ease gentlemen said morcerf somewhat piqued when i look at you parisians idlers on the boulevard de gand or the bois de boulogne and think of this man it seems to me we are not of the same race i am highly flattered returned beauchamp at the same time added chteau-renaud your count of monte cristo is a very fine fellow always excepting his little arrangements with the italian banditti there are no italian banditti said debray no vampire cried beauchamp no count of monte cristo added debray there is half-past ten striking albert m confess you have dreamed this and let us sit down to breakfast continued beauchamp but the sound of the clock had not died away when germain announced his excellency the count of monte cristo the involuntary start everyone gave proved how much morcerfs narrative had impressed them and albert himself could not wholly refrain from manifesting sudden emotion he had not heard a carriage stop in the street or steps in the antechamber the door had itself opened noiselessly the count appeared dressed with the greatest simplicity but the most fastidious dandy could have found nothing to cavil at in his toilet every article of dress hat coat gloves and boots was from the first makers he seemed scarcely five-and-thirty but what struck everybody was his extreme resemblance to the portrait debray had drawn the count advanced smiling into the centre of the room and approached albert who hastened towards him holding out his hand in a ceremonial manner punctuality said monte cristo is the politeness of kings according to one of your sovereigns i think but it is not the same with travellers however i hope you will excuse the two or three seconds i am behindhand five hundred leagues are not to be accomplished without some trouble and especially in france where it seems it is forbidden to beat the postilions my dear count replied albert i was announcing your visit to some of my friends whom i had invited in consequence of the promise you did me the honor to make and whom i now present to you they are the count of chteau-renaud whose nobility goes back to the twelve peers and whose ancestors had a place at the round table m lucien debray private secretary to the minister of the interior m beauchamp an editor of a paper and the terror of the french government but of whom in spite of his national celebrity you perhaps have not heard in italy since his paper is prohibited there and m maximilian morrel captain of spahis at this name the count who had hitherto saluted everyone with courtesy but at the same time with coldness and formality stepped a pace forward and a slight tinge of red colored his pale cheeks you wear the uniform of the new french conquerors monsieur said he it is a handsome uniform no one could have said what caused the counts voice to vibrate so deeply and what made his eye flash which was in general so clear lustrous and limpid when he pleased you have never seen our africans count said albert never replied the count who was by this time perfectly master of himself again well beneath this uniform beats one of the bravest and noblest hearts in the whole army oh m de morcerf interrupted morrel let me go on captain and we have just heard continued albert of a new deed of his and so heroic a one that although i have seen him today for the first time i request you to allow me to introduce him as my friend at these words it was still possible to observe in monte cristo the concentrated look changing color and slight trembling of the eyelid that show emotion ah you have a noble heart said the count so much the better this exclamation which corresponded to the counts own thought rather than to what albert was saying surprised everybody and especially morrel who looked at monte cristo with wonder but at the same time the intonation was so soft that however strange the speech might seem it was impossible to be offended at it m why should he doubt it said beauchamp to chteau-renaud in reality replied the latter who with his aristocratic glance and his knowledge of the world had penetrated at once all that was penetrable in monte cristo albert has not deceived us for the count is a most singular being what say you morrel ma foi he has an open look about him that pleases me in spite of the singular remark he has made about me gentlemen said albert germain informs me that breakfast is ready my dear count allow me to show you the way they passed silently into the breakfast-room and everyone took his place gentlemen said the count seating himself permit
