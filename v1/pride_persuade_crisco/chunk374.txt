bandits here is a young man who seeks and wishes to speak to you said the sentinel what has he to say inquired the young man who was in command in the chiefs absence i wish to say that i am tired of a shepherds life was vampas reply ah i understand said the lieutenant and you seek admittance into our ranks welcome cried several bandits from ferrusino pampinara and anagni who had recognized luigi vampa yes but i came to ask something more than to be your companion and what may that be inquired the bandits with astonishment i come to ask to be your captain said the young man the bandits shouted with laughter and what have you done to aspire to this honor demanded the lieutenant i have killed your chief cucumetto whose dress i now wear and i set fire to the villa san-felice to procure a wedding-dress for my betrothed an hour afterwards luigi vampa was chosen captain vice cucumetto deceased m well my dear albert said franz turning towards his friend what think you of citizen luigi vampa i say he is a myth replied albert and never had an existence and what may a myth be inquired pastrini the explanation would be too long my dear landlord replied franz and you say that signor vampa exercises his profession at this moment in the environs of rome and with a boldness of which no bandit before him ever gave an example then the police have vainly tried to lay hands on him why you see he has a good understanding with the shepherds in the plains the fishermen of the tiber and the smugglers of the coast they seek for him in the mountains and he is on the waters they follow him on the waters and he is on the open sea then they pursue him and he has suddenly taken refuge in the islands at giglio giannutri or monte cristo and when they hunt for him there he reappears suddenly at albano tivoli or la riccia and how does he behave towards travellers alas his plan is very simple it depends on the distance he may be from the city whether he gives eight hours twelve hours or a day wherein to pay their ransom and when that time has elapsed he allows another hours grace at the sixtieth minute of this hour if the money is not forthcoming he blows out the prisoners brains with a pistol-shot or plants his dagger in his heart and that settles the account well albert inquired franz of his companion are you still disposed to go to the colosseum by the outer wall quite so said albert if the way be picturesque the clock struck nine as the door opened and a coachman appeared excellencies said he the coach is ready well then said franz let us to the colosseum by the porta del popolo or by the streets your excellencies by the streets morbleu by the streets cried franz ah my dear fellow said albert rising and lighting his third cigar really i thought you had more courage so saying the two young men went down the staircase and got into the carriage m chapter the colosseum franz had so managed his route that during the ride to the colosseum they passed not a single ancient ruin so that no preliminary impression interfered to mitigate the colossal proportions of the gigantic building they came to admire the road selected was a continuation of the via sistina then by cutting off the right angle of the street in which stands santa maria maggiore and proceeding by the via urbana and san pietro in vincoli the travellers would find themselves directly opposite the colosseum this itinerary possessed another great advantage that of leaving franz at full liberty to indulge his deep reverie upon the subject of signor pastrinis story in which his mysterious host of monte cristo was so strangely mixed up seated with folded arms in a corner of the carriage he continued to ponder over the singular history he had so lately listened to and to ask himself an interminable number of questions touching its various circumstances without however arriving at a satisfactory reply to any of them one fact more than the rest brought his friend sinbad the sailor back to his recollection and that was the mysterious sort of intimacy that seemed to exist between the brigands and the sailors and pastrinis account of vampas having found refuge on board the vessels of smugglers and fishermen reminded franz of the two corsican bandits he had found supping so amicably with the crew of the little yacht which had even deviated from its course and touched at porto-vecchio for the sole purpose of landing them the very name assumed by his host of monte cristo and again repeated by the landlord of the htel de londres abundantly proved to him that his island friend was playing his philanthropic part on the shores of piombino civita vecchia ostia and gata as on those of corsica tuscany and spain and further franz bethought him of having heard his singular entertainer speak both of tunis and palermo proving thereby how largely his circle of acquaintances extended but however the mind of the young man might be absorbed in these reflections they were at once dispersed at the sight
