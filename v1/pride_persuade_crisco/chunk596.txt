the nature of the statement which has displeased you an announcement has been made which implicates the honor of a member of my family what is it said beauchamp much surprised surely you must be mistaken the story sent you from yanina yanina yes really you appear to be totally ignorant of the cause which brings me here such is really the case i assure you upon my honor baptiste give me yesterdays paper cried beauchamp here i have brought mine with me replied albert beauchamp took the paper and read the article to which albert pointed in an undertone you see it is a serious annoyance said morcerf when beauchamp had finished the perusal of the paragraph is the officer referred to a relation of yours then demanded the journalist yes said albert blushing well what do you wish me to do for you said beauchamp mildly my dear beauchamp i wish you to contradict this statement beauchamp looked at albert with a benevolent expression come said he this matter will want a good deal of talking over a retractation is always a serious thing you know sit down and i will read it again albert resumed his seat and beauchamp read with more attention than at first the lines denounced by his friend well said albert in a determined tone you see that your paper has insulted a member of my family and i insist on a retractation being made you insist yes i insist permit me to remind you that you are not in the chamber my dear viscount nor do i wish to be there replied the young man rising i repeat that i am determined to have the announcement of yesterday contradicted you have known me long enough continued albert biting his lips convulsively for he saw that beauchamps anger was beginning to rise you have been my friend and therefore sufficiently intimate with me to be aware that i am likely to maintain my resolution on this point if i have been your friend morcerf your present manner of speaking would almost lead me to forget that i ever bore that title but wait a moment do not let us get angry or at least not yet you are irritated and vexed tell me how this fernand is related to you he is merely my father said albert m fernand mondego count of morcerf an old soldier who has fought in twenty battles and whose honorable scars they would denounce as badges of disgrace is it your father said beauchamp that is quite another thing then i can well understand your indignation my dear albert i will look at it again and he read the paragraph for the third time laying a stress on each word as he proceeded but the paper nowhere identifies this fernand with your father m no but the connection will be seen by others and therefore i will have the article contradicted at the words i will beauchamp steadily raised his eyes to alberts countenance and then as gradually lowering them he remained thoughtful for a few moments you will retract this assertion will you not beauchamp said albert with increased though stifled anger yes replied beauchamp immediately said albert when i am convinced that the statement is false what the thing is worth looking into and i will take pains to investigate the matter thoroughly but what is there to investigate sir said albert enraged beyond measure at beauchamps last remark if you do not believe that it is my father say so immediately and if on the contrary you believe it to be him state your reasons for doing so beauchamp looked at albert with the smile which was so peculiar to him and which in its numerous modifications served to express every varied emotion of his mind sir replied he if you came to me with the idea of demanding satisfaction you should have gone at once to the point and not have entertained me with the idle conversation to which i have been patiently listening for the last half hour am i to put this construction on your visit yes if you will not consent to retract that infamous calumny wait a moment no threats if you please m fernand mondego vicomte de morcerf i never allow them from my enemies and therefore shall not put up with them from my friends you insist on my contradicting the article relating to general fernand an article with which i assure you on my word of honor i had nothing whatever to do yes i insist on it said albert whose mind was beginning to get bewildered with the excitement of his feelings and if i refuse to retract you wish to fight do you said beauchamp in a calm tone yes replied albert raising his voice well said beauchamp here is my answer my dear sir the article was not inserted by me i was not even aware of it but you have by the step you have taken called my attention to the paragraph in question and it will remain until it shall be either contradicted or confirmed by someone who has a right to do so sir said albert rising i will do myself the honor of sending my seconds to you and you will be kind enough to arrange with them the place of meeting
