for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyships concurrence you cannot be too much upon your guard risk anything rather than her displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home and be satisfied that we shall take no offence believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this and for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire as for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my cousin elizabeth with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew all of them equally surprised that he meditated a quick return mrs bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers he might become a very agreeable companion but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away miss lucas called soon after breakfast and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before the possibility of mr collinss fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum and she could not help crying out engaged to mr collins my dear charlotte impossible the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach though as it was no more than she expected she soon regained her composure and calmly replied why should you be surprised my dear eliza do you think it incredible that mr collins should be able to procure any womans good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with you but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her all imaginable happiness i see what you are feeling replied charlotte you must be surprised very much surprised so lately as mr collins was wishing to marry you but when you have had time to think it over i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done i am not romantic you know i never was i ask only a comfortable home and considering mr collinss character connection and situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly and after an awkward pause they returned to the rest of the family charlotte did not stay much longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match the strangeness of mr collinss making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted she had always felt that charlottes opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own but she had not supposed it to be possible that when called into action she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage charlotte the wife of mr collins was a most humiliating picture and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen chapter elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on what she had heard and doubting whether she was authorised to mention it when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family with many compliments to them and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses he unfolded the matter to an audience not merely wondering but incredulous for mrs bennet with more perseverance than politeness protested he must be entirely mistaken and lydia always unguarded and often uncivil boisterously exclaimed good lord sir william how can you tell such a story do not you know that mr collins wants to marry lizzy nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment but sir williams good breeding carried him through it all and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
