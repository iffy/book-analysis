hearing the cries of maximilian morrel seized their hands and opening the door exclaimed in a voice choked with sobs on your knees on your knees he is our benefactor the saviour of our father he is he would have added edmond dants but the count seized his arm and prevented him julie threw herself into the arms of the count emmanuel embraced him as a guardian angel morrel again fell on his knees and struck the ground with his forehead then the iron-hearted man felt his heart swell in his breast a flame seemed to rush from his throat to his eyes he bent his head and wept for a while nothing was heard in the room but a succession of sobs while the incense from their grateful hearts mounted to heaven julie had scarcely recovered from her deep emotion when she rushed out of the room descended to the next floor ran into the drawing-room with childlike joy and raised the crystal globe which covered the purse given by the unknown of the alles de meilhan meanwhile emmanuel in a broken voice said to the count oh count how could you hearing us so often speak of our unknown benefactor seeing us pay such homage of gratitude and adoration to his memory how could you continue so long without discovering yourself to us oh it was cruel to us and dare i say it to you also listen my friends said the count i may call you so since we have really been friends for the last eleven years the discovery of this secret has been occasioned by a great event which you must never know i wished to bury it during my whole life in my own bosom but your brother maximilian wrested it from me by a violence he repents of now i am sure then turning around and seeing that morrel still on his knees had thrown himself into an armchair he added in a low voice pressing emmanuels hand significantly watch over him why so asked the young man surprised i cannot explain myself but watch over him emmanuel looked around the room and caught sight of the pistols his eyes rested on the weapons and he pointed to them monte cristo bent his head emmanuel went towards the pistols leave them said monte cristo then walking towards morrel he took his hand the tumultuous agitation of the young man was succeeded by a profound stupor julie returned holding the silken purse in her hands while tears of joy rolled down her cheeks like dewdrops on the rose here is the relic she said do not think it will be less dear to us now we are acquainted with our benefactor my child said monte cristo coloring allow me to take back that purse since you now know my face i wish to be remembered alone through the affection i hope you will grant me oh said julie pressing the purse to her heart no no i beseech you do not take it for some unhappy day you will leave us will you not you have guessed rightly madame replied monte cristo smiling in a week i shall have left this country where so many persons who merit the vengeance of heaven lived happily while my father perished of hunger and grief while announcing his departure the count fixed his eyes on morrel and remarked that the words i shall have left this country had failed to rouse him from his lethargy he then saw that he must make another struggle against the grief of his friend and taking the hands of emmanuel and julie which he pressed within his own he said with the mild authority of a father my kind friends leave me alone with maximilian julie saw the means offered of carrying off her precious relic which monte cristo had forgotten she drew her husband to the door let us leave them she said the count was alone with morrel who remained motionless as a statue come said monte-cristo touching his shoulder with his finger are you a man again maximilian yes for i begin to suffer again the count frowned apparently in gloomy hesitation maximilian maximilian he said the ideas you yield to are unworthy of a christian oh do not fear my friend said morrel raising his head and smiling with a sweet expression on the count i shall no longer attempt my life then we are to have no more pistols no more despair no i have found a better remedy for my grief than either a bullet or a knife poor fellow what is it my grief will kill me of itself my friend said monte cristo with an expression of melancholy equal to his own listen to me one day in a moment of despair like yours since it led to a similar resolution i also wished to kill myself one day your father equally desperate wished to kill himself too if anyone had said to your father at the moment he raised the pistol to his head if anyone had told me when in my prison i pushed back the food i had not tasted for three days if anyone had said to either of us then live the day will come when you will be happy and will bless life no matter whose voice had spoken
