attributes to his goddesses chapter the challenge then continued beauchamp i took advantage of the silence and the darkness to leave the house without being seen the usher who had introduced me was waiting for me at the door and he conducted me through the corridors to a private entrance opening into the rue de vaugirard i left with mingled feelings of sorrow and delight excuse me albert sorrow on your account and delight with that noble girl thus pursuing paternal vengeance yes albert from whatever source the blow may have proceeded it may be from an enemy but that enemy is only the agent of providence albert held his head between his hands he raised his face red with shame and bathed in tears and seizing beauchamps arm my friend said he my life is ended i cannot calmly say with you providence has struck the blow but i must discover who pursues me with this hatred and when i have found him i shall kill him or he will kill me i rely on your friendship to assist me beauchamp if contempt has not banished it from your heart contempt my friend how does this misfortune affect you no happily that unjust prejudice is forgotten which made the son responsible for the fathers actions review your life albert although it is only just beginning did a lovely summers day ever dawn with greater purity than has marked the commencement of your career no albert take my advice you are young and rich leave paris all is soon forgotten in this great babylon of excitement and changing tastes you will return after three or four years with a russian princess for a bride and no one will think more of what occurred yesterday than if it had happened sixteen years ago thank you my dear beauchamp thank you for the excellent feeling which prompts your advice but it cannot be i have told you my wish or rather my determination you understand that interested as i am in this affair i cannot see it in the same light as you do what appears to you to emanate from a celestial source seems to me to proceed from one far less pure providence appears to me to have no share in this affair and happily so for instead of the invisible impalpable agent of celestial rewards and punishments i shall find one both palpable and visible on whom i shall revenge myself i assure you for all i have suffered during the last month now i repeat beauchamp i wish to return to human and material existence and if you are still the friend you profess to be help me to discover the hand that struck the blow be it so said beauchamp if you must have me descend to earth i submit and if you will seek your enemy i will assist you and i will engage to find him my honor being almost as deeply interested as yours well then you understand beauchamp that we begin our search immediately each moments delay is an eternity for me the calumniator is not yet punished and he may hope that he will not be but on my honor if he thinks so he deceives himself well listen morcerf ah beauchamp i see you know something already you will restore me to life i do not say there is any truth in what i am going to tell you but it is at least a ray of light in a dark night by following it we may perhaps discover something more certain tell me satisfy my impatience well i will tell you what i did not like to mention on my return from yanina say on i went of course to the chief banker of the town to make inquiries at the first word before i had even mentioned your fathers name ah said he i guess what brings you here how and why because a fortnight since i was questioned on the same subject by whom by a banker of paris my correspondent whose name is danglars he cried albert yes it is indeed he who has so long pursued my father with jealous hatred he the man who would be popular cannot forgive the count of morcerf for being created a peer and this marriage broken off without a reason being assigned yes it is all from the same cause make inquiries albert but do not be angry without reason make inquiries and if it be true oh yes if it be true cried the young man he shall pay me all i have suffered beware morcerf he is already an old man i will respect his age as he has respected the honor of my family if my father had offended him why did he not attack him personally oh no he was afraid to encounter him face to face i do not condemn you albert i only restrain you act prudently oh do not fear besides you will accompany me beauchamp solemn transactions should be sanctioned by a witness before this day closes if m danglars is guilty he shall cease to live or i shall die pardieu beauchamp mine shall be a splendid funeral when such resolutions are made albert they should be promptly executed do you wish to go to m danglars let us go immediately they
