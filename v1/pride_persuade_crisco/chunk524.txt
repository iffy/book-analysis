shocking hurry to be off you forget one of my guests lean a little to the left stay look at m andrea cavalcanti the young man in a black coat looking at murillos madonna now he is turning this time bertuccio would have uttered an exclamation had not a look from monte cristo silenced him benedetto he muttered fatality half-past six oclock has just struck m bertuccio said the count severely i ordered dinner at that hour and i do not like to wait and he returned to his guests while bertuccio leaning against the wall succeeded in reaching the dining-room five minutes afterwards the doors of the drawing-room were thrown open and bertuccio appearing said with a violent effort the dinner waits the count of monte cristo offered his arm to madame de villefort m de villefort he said will you conduct the baroness danglars villefort complied and they passed on to the dining-room chapter the dinner it was evident that one sentiment affected all the guests on entering the dining-room each one asked what strange influence had brought them to this house and yet astonished even uneasy though they were they still felt that they would not like to be absent the recent events the solitary and eccentric position of the count his enormous nay almost incredible fortune should have made men cautious and have altogether prevented ladies visiting a house where there was no one of their own sex to receive them and yet curiosity had been enough to lead them to overleap the bounds of prudence and decorum and all present even including cavalcanti and his son notwithstanding the stiffness of the one and the carelessness of the other were thoughtful on finding themselves assembled at the house of this incomprehensible man madame danglars had started when villefort on the counts invitation offered his arm and villefort felt that his glance was uneasy beneath his gold spectacles when he felt the arm of the baroness press upon his own none of this had escaped the count and even by this mere contact of individuals the scene had already acquired considerable interest for an observer m de villefort had on the right hand madame danglars on his left morrel the count was seated between madame de villefort and danglars the other seats were filled by debray who was placed between the two cavalcanti and by chteau-renaud seated between madame de villefort and morrel the repast was magnificent monte cristo had endeavored completely to overturn the parisian ideas and to feed the curiosity as much as the appetite of his guests it was an oriental feast that he offered to them but of such a kind as the arabian fairies might be supposed to prepare every delicious fruit that the four quarters of the globe could provide was heaped in vases from china and jars from japan rare birds retaining their most brilliant plumage enormous fish spread upon massive silver dishes together with every wine produced in the archipelago asia minor or the cape sparkling in bottles whose grotesque shape seemed to give an additional flavor to the draught all these like one of the displays with which apicius of old gratified his guests passed in review before the eyes of the astonished parisians who understood that it was possible to expend a thousand louis upon a dinner for ten persons but only on the condition of eating pearls like cleopatra or drinking refined gold like lorenzo de medici monte cristo noticed the general astonishment and began laughing and joking about it gentlemen he said you will admit that when arrived at a certain degree of fortune the superfluities of life are all that can be desired and the ladies will allow that after having risen to a certain eminence of position the ideal alone can be more exalted now to follow out this reasoning what is the marvellous that which we do not understand what is it that we really desire that which we cannot obtain now to see things which i cannot understand to procure impossibilities these are the study of my life i gratify my wishes by two means my will and my money i take as much interest in the pursuit of some whim as you do m danglars in promoting a new railway line you m de villefort in condemning a culprit to death you m debray in pacifying a kingdom you m de chteau-renaud in pleasing a woman and you morrel in breaking a horse that no one can ride for example you see these two fish one brought from fifty leagues beyond st petersburg the other five leagues from naples is it not amusing to see them both on the same table what are the two fish asked danglars m chteau-renaud who has lived in russia will tell you the name of one and major cavalcanti who is an italian will tell you the name of the other this one is i think a sterlet said chteau-renaud and that one if i mistake not a lamprey just so now m danglars ask these gentlemen where they are caught sterlets said chteau-renaud are only found in the volga and said cavalcanti i know that lake fusaro alone supplies lampreys of that size exactly one comes from the volga and the other from lake fusaro impossible cried all the guests simultaneously well this is just
