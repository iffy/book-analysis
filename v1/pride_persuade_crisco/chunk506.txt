the price they told me it was francs i was therefore obliged to give it up as you may imagine but i own i went away with rather a heavy heart for the horse had looked at me affectionately had rubbed his head against me and when i mounted him had pranced in the most delightful way imaginable so that i was altogether fascinated with him the same evening some friends of mine visited me m de chteau-renaud m debray and five or six other choice spirits whom you do not know even by name they proposed a game of bouillotte i never play for i am not rich enough to afford to lose or sufficiently poor to desire to gain but i was at my own house you understand so there was nothing to be done but to send for the cards which i did just as they were sitting down to table m de monte cristo arrived he took his seat amongst them they played and i won i am almost ashamed to say that my gains amounted to francs we separated at midnight i could not defer my pleasure so i took a cabriolet and drove to the horse dealers feverish and excited i rang at the door the person who opened it must have taken me for a madman for i rushed at once to the stable mdah was standing at the rack eating his hay i immediately put on the saddle and bridle to which operation he lent himself with the best grace possible then putting the francs into the hands of the astonished dealer i proceeded to fulfil my intention of passing the night in riding in the champs-lyses as i rode by the counts house i perceived a light in one of the windows and fancied i saw the shadow of his figure moving behind the curtain now valentine i firmly believe that he knew of my wish to possess this horse and that he lost expressly to give me the means of procuring him my dear maximilian you are really too fanciful you will not love even me long a man who accustoms himself to live in such a world of poetry and imagination must find far too little excitement in a common every-day sort of attachment such as ours but they are calling me do you hear ah valentine said maximilian give me but one finger through this opening in the grating one finger the littlest finger of all that i may have the happiness of kissing it maximilian we said we would be to each other as two voices two shadows as you will valentine shall you be happy if i do what you wish oh yes valentine mounted on a bench and passed not only her finger but her whole hand through the opening maximilian uttered a cry of delight and springing forwards seized the hand extended towards him and imprinted on it a fervent and impassioned kiss the little hand was then immediately withdrawn and the young man saw valentine hurrying towards the house as though she were almost terrified at her own sensations chapter m noirtier de villefort we will now relate what was passing in the house of the kings attorney after the departure of madame danglars and her daughter and during the time of the conversation between maximilian and valentine which we have just detailed m de villefort entered his fathers room followed by madame de villefort both of the visitors after saluting the old man and speaking to barrois a faithful servant who had been twenty-five years in his service took their places on either side of the paralytic m noirtier was sitting in an armchair which moved upon casters in which he was wheeled into the room in the morning and in the same way drawn out again at night he was placed before a large glass which reflected the whole apartment and so without any attempt to move which would have been impossible he could see all who entered the room and everything which was going on around him m noirtier although almost as immovable as a corpse looked at the new-comers with a quick and intelligent expression perceiving at once by their ceremonious courtesy that they were come on business of an unexpected and official character sight and hearing were the only senses remaining and they like two solitary sparks remained to animate the miserable body which seemed fit for nothing but the grave it was only however by means of one of these senses that he could reveal the thoughts and feelings that still occupied his mind and the look by which he gave expression to his inner life was like the distant gleam of a candle which a traveller sees by night across some desert place and knows that a living being dwells beyond the silence and obscurity noirtiers hair was long and white and flowed over his shoulders while in his eyes shaded by thick black lashes was concentrated as it often happens with an organ which is used to the exclusion of the others all the activity address force and intelligence which were formerly diffused over his whole body and so although the movement of the arm the sound of the voice and the agility of the body were wanting the speaking eye sufficed for all he commanded with
