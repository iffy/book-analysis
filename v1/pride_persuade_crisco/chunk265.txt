confided to me and now when i see the fruition of my wishes almost within reach the power i hold in my hands bursts and shatters me to atoms sire it is fatality murmured the minister feeling that the pressure of circumstances however light a thing to destiny was too much for any human strength to endure what our enemies say of us is then true we have learnt nothing forgotten nothing if i were betrayed as he was i would console myself but to be in the midst of persons elevated by myself to places of honor who ought to watch over me more carefully than over themselves for my fortune is theirs before me they were nothing after me they will be nothing and perish miserably from incapacity ineptitude oh yes sir you are right it is fatality the minister quailed before this outburst of sarcasm m de blacas wiped the moisture from his brow villefort smiled within himself for he felt his increased importance to fall continued king louis who at the first glance had sounded the abyss on which the monarchy hung suspended to fall and learn of that fall by telegraph oh i would rather mount the scaffold of my brother louis xvi than thus descend the staircase at the tuileries driven away by ridicule ridicule sir why you know not its power in france and yet you ought to know it sire sire murmured the minister for pitys approach m de villefort resumed the king addressing the young man who motionless and breathless was listening to a conversation on which depended the destiny of a kingdom approach and tell monsieur that it is possible to know beforehand all that he has not known sire it was really impossible to learn secrets which that man concealed from all the world really impossible yes that is a great word sir unfortunately there are great words as there are great men i have measured them really impossible for a minister who has an office agents spies and fifteen hundred thousand francs for secret service money to know what is going on at sixty leagues from the coast of france well then see here is a gentleman who had none of these resources at his disposal a gentleman only a simple magistrate who learned more than you with all your police and who would have saved my crown if like you he had the power of directing a telegraph the look of the minister of police was turned with concentrated spite on villefort who bent his head in modest triumph i do not mean that for you blacas continued louis xviii for if you have discovered nothing at least you have had the good sense to persevere in your suspicions any other than yourself would have considered the disclosure of m de villefort insignificant or else dictated by venal ambition these words were an allusion to the sentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much confidence an hour before villefort understood the kings intent any other person would perhaps have been overcome by such an intoxicating draught of praise but he feared to make for himself a mortal enemy of the police minister although he saw that dandr was irrevocably lost in fact the minister who in the plenitude of his power had been unable to unearth napoleons secret might in despair at his own downfall interrogate dants and so lay bare the motives of villeforts plot realizing this villefort came to the rescue of the crest-fallen minister instead of aiding to crush him sire said villefort the suddenness of this event must prove to your majesty that the issue is in the hands of providence what your majesty is pleased to attribute to me as profound perspicacity is simply owing to chance and i have profited by that chance like a good and devoted servant thats all do not attribute to me more than i deserve sire that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the first opinion you have been pleased to form of me the minister of police thanked the young man by an eloquent look and villefort understood that he had succeeded in his design that is to say that without forfeiting the gratitude of the king he had made a friend of one on whom in case of necessity he might rely tis well resumed the king and now gentlemen he continued turning towards m de blacas and the minister of police i have no further occasion for you and you may retire what now remains to do is in the department of the minister of war fortunately sire said m de blacas we can rely on the army your majesty knows how every report confirms their loyalty and attachment do not mention reports duke to me for i know now what confidence to place in them yet speaking of reports baron what have you learned with regard to the affair in the rue saint-jacques the affair in the rue saint-jacques exclaimed villefort unable to repress an exclamation then suddenly pausing he added your pardon sire but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget not the respect i have for that is too deeply engraved in my heart but the rules of etiquette go on go on sir replied the king you have today earned the right to make
