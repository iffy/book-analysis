are those who eat my dinners mount my horses and exhaust my fortune and pray who are the persons who exhaust your fortune explain yourself more clearly i beg sir oh make yourself easy i am not speaking riddles and you will soon know what i mean the people who exhaust my fortune are those who draw out francs in the course of an hour i do not understand you sir said the baroness trying to disguise the agitation of her voice and the flush of her face you understand me perfectly on the contrary said danglars but if you will persist i will tell you that i have just lost francs upon the spanish loan and pray asked the baroness am i responsible for this loss why not is it my fault you have lost francs certainly it is not mine once for all sir replied the baroness sharply i tell you i will not hear cash named it is a style of language i never heard in the house of my parents or in that of my first husband oh i can well believe that for neither of them was worth a penny the better reason for my not being conversant with the slang of the bank which is here dinning in my ears from morning to night that noise of jingling crowns which are constantly being counted and re-counted is odious to me i only know one thing i dislike more which is the sound of your voice really said danglars well this surprises me for i thought you took the liveliest interest in all my affairs m i what could put such an idea into your head yourself ah what next most assuredly i should like to know upon what occasion oh mon dieu that is very easily done last february you were the first who told me of the haitian funds you had dreamed that a ship had entered the harbor at le havre that this ship brought news that a payment we had looked upon as lost was going to be made i know how clear-sighted your dreams are i therefore purchased immediately as many shares as i could of the haitian debt and i gained francs by it of which have been honestly paid to you you spent it as you pleased that was your business in march there was a question about a grant to a railway three companies presented themselves each offering equal securities you told me that your instinct and although you pretend to know nothing about speculations i think on the contrary that your comprehension is very clear upon certain affairs well you told me that your instinct led you to believe the grant would be given to the company called the southern i bought two thirds of the shares of that company as you had foreseen the shares trebled in value and i picked up a million from which francs were paid to you for pin-money how have you spent this francs it is no business of mine when are you coming to the point cried the baroness shivering with anger and impatience patience madame i am coming to it thats fortunate in april you went to dine at the ministers you heard a private conversation respecting spanish affairs on the expulsion of don carlos i bought some spanish shares the expulsion took place and i pocketed francs the day charles v repassed the bidassoa of these francs you took crowns they were yours you disposed of them according to your fancy and i asked no questions but it is not the less true that you have this year received livres well sir and what then ah yes it was just after this that you spoiled everything really your manner of speaking it expresses my meaning and that is all i want well three days after that you talked politics with m debray and you fancied from his words that don carlos had returned to spain well i sold my shares the news got out and i no longer sold i gave them away next day i find the news was false and by this false report i have lost francs well well since i gave you a fourth of my gains i think you owe me a fourth of my losses the fourth of francs is francs what you say is absurd and i cannot see why m debrays name is mixed up in this affair because if you do not possess the francs i reclaim you must have lent them to your friends and m debray is one of your friends m for shame exclaimed the baroness oh let us have no gestures no screams no modern drama or you will oblige me to tell you that i see debray leave here pocketing the whole of the livres you have handed over to him this year while he smiles to himself saying that he has found what the most skilful players have never discovered that is a roulette where he wins without playing and is no loser when he loses the baroness became enraged wretch she cried will you dare to tell me you did not know what you now reproach me with i do not say that i did know it and i do not say that i did not know it i merely tell you to
