at once beauchamp was in his bath here i am albert said well my poor friend replied beauchamp i expected you i need not say i think you are too faithful and too kind to have spoken of that painful circumstance your having sent for me is another proof of your affection so without losing time tell me have you the slightest idea whence this terrible blow proceeds i think i have some clew but first tell me all the particulars of this shameful plot beauchamp proceeded to relate to the young man who was overwhelmed with shame and grief the following facts two days previously the article had appeared in another paper besides limpartial and what was more serious one that was well known as a government paper beauchamp was breakfasting when he read the paragraph he sent immediately for a cabriolet and hastened to the publishers office although professing diametrically opposite principles from those of the editor of the other paper beauchamp as it sometimes we may say often happens was his intimate friend the editor was reading with apparent delight a leading article in the same paper on beet-sugar probably a composition of his own ah pardieu said beauchamp with the paper in your hand my friend i need not tell you the cause of my visit are you interested in the sugar question asked the editor of the ministerial paper no replied beauchamp i have not considered the question a totally different subject interests me what is it the article relative to morcerf indeed is it not a curious affair so curious that i think you are running a great risk of a prosecution for defamation of character not at all we have received with the information all the requisite proofs and we are quite sure m de morcerf will not raise his voice against us besides it is rendering a service to ones country to denounce these wretched criminals who are unworthy of the honor bestowed on them beauchamp was thunderstruck who then has so correctly informed you asked he for my paper which gave the first information on the subject has been obliged to stop for want of proof and yet we are more interested than you in exposing m de morcerf as he is a peer of france and we are of the opposition oh that is very simple we have not sought to scandalize this news was brought to us a man arrived yesterday from yanina bringing a formidable array of documents and when we hesitated to publish the accusatory article he told us it should be inserted in some other paper beauchamp understood that nothing remained but to submit and left the office to despatch a courier to morcerf but he had been unable to send to albert the following particulars as the events had transpired after the messengers departure namely that the same day a great agitation was manifest in the house of peers among the usually calm members of that dignified assembly everyone had arrived almost before the usual hour and was conversing on the melancholy event which was to attract the attention of the public towards one of their most illustrious colleagues some were perusing the article others making comments and recalling circumstances which substantiated the charges still more the count of morcerf was no favorite with his colleagues like all upstarts he had had recourse to a great deal of haughtiness to maintain his position the true nobility laughed at him the talented repelled him and the honorable instinctively despised him he was in fact in the unhappy position of the victim marked for sacrifice the finger of god once pointed at him everyone was prepared to raise the hue and cry the count of morcerf alone was ignorant of the news he did not take in the paper containing the defamatory article and had passed the morning in writing letters and in trying a horse he arrived at his usual hour with a proud look and insolent demeanor he alighted passed through the corridors and entered the house without observing the hesitation of the door-keepers or the coolness of his colleagues m business had already been going on for half an hour when he entered everyone held the accusing paper but as usual no one liked to take upon himself the responsibility of the attack at length an honorable peer morcerfs acknowledged enemy ascended the tribune with that solemnity which announced that the expected moment had arrived there was an impressive silence morcerf alone knew not why such profound attention was given to an orator who was not always listened to with so much complacency the count did not notice the introduction in which the speaker announced that his communication would be of that vital importance that it demanded the undivided attention of the house but at the mention of yanina and colonel fernand he turned so frightfully pale that every member shuddered and fixed his eyes upon him moral wounds have this peculiarity they may be hidden but they never close always painful always ready to bleed when touched they remain fresh and open in the heart the article having been read during the painful hush that followed a universal shudder pervaded the assembly and immediately the closest attention was given to the orator as he resumed his remarks he stated his scruples and the difficulties of
