of the dark frowning ruins of the stupendous colosseum through the various openings of which the pale moonlight played and flickered like the unearthly gleam from the eyes of the wandering dead the carriage stopped near the meta sudans the door was opened and the young men eagerly alighting found themselves opposite a cicerone who appeared to have sprung up from the ground so unexpected was his appearance the usual guide from the hotel having followed them they had paid two conductors nor is it possible at rome to avoid this abundant supply of guides besides the ordinary cicerone who seizes upon you directly you set foot in your hotel and never quits you while you remain in the city there is also a special cicerone belonging to each monument nay almost to each part of a monument it may therefore be easily imagined there is no scarcity of guides at the colosseum that wonder of all ages which martial thus eulogizes let memphis cease to boast the barbarous miracles of her pyramids and the wonders of babylon be talked of no more among us all must bow to the superiority of the gigantic labor of the csars and the many voices of fame spread far and wide the surpassing merits of this incomparable monument as for albert and franz they essayed not to escape from their ciceronian tyrants and indeed it would have been so much the more difficult to break their bondage as the guides alone are permitted to visit these monuments with torches in their hands thus then the young men made no attempt at resistance but blindly and confidingly surrendered themselves into the care and custody of their conductors franz had already made seven or eight similar excursions to the colosseum while his less favored companion trod for the first time in his life the classic ground forming the monument of flavius vespasian and to his credit be it spoken his mind even amid the glib loquacity of the guides was duly and deeply touched with awe and enthusiastic admiration of all he saw and certainly no adequate notion of these stupendous ruins can be formed save by such as have visited them and more especially by moonlight at which time the vast proportions of the building appear twice as large when viewed by the mysterious beams of a southern moonlit sky whose rays are sufficiently clear and vivid to light the horizon with a glow equal to the soft twilight of a western clime scarcely therefore had the reflective franz walked a hundred steps beneath the interior porticoes of the ruin when abandoning albert to the guides who would by no means yield their prescriptive right of carrying their victims through the routine regularly laid down and as regularly followed by them but dragged the unconscious visitor to the various objects with a pertinacity that admitted of no appeal beginning as a matter of course with the lions den the hall of the gladiators and finishing with csars podium to escape a jargon and mechanical survey of the wonders by which he was surrounded franz ascended a half-dilapidated staircase and leaving them to follow their monotonous round seated himself at the foot of a column and immediately opposite a large aperture which permitted him to enjoy a full and undisturbed view of the gigantic dimensions of the majestic ruin franz had remained for nearly a quarter of an hour perfectly hidden by the shadow of the vast column at whose base he had found a resting-place and from whence his eyes followed the motions of albert and his guides who holding torches in their hands had emerged from a vomitorium at the opposite extremity of the colosseum and then again disappeared down the steps conducting to the seats reserved for the vestal virgins resembling as they glided along some restless shades following the flickering glare of so many ignes fatui all at once his ear caught a sound resembling that of a stone rolling down the staircase opposite the one by which he had himself ascended there was nothing remarkable in the circumstance of a fragment of granite giving way and falling heavily below but it seemed to him that the substance that fell gave way beneath the pressure of a foot and also that someone who endeavored as much as possible to prevent his footsteps from being heard was approaching the spot where he sat conjecture soon became certainty for the figure of a man was distinctly visible to franz gradually emerging from the staircase opposite upon which the moon was at that moment pouring a full tide of silvery brightness the stranger thus presenting himself was probably a person who like franz preferred the enjoyment of solitude and his own thoughts to the frivolous gabble of the guides and his appearance had nothing extraordinary in it but the hesitation with which he proceeded stopping and listening with anxious attention at every step he took convinced franz that he expected the arrival of some person by a sort of instinctive impulse franz withdrew as much as possible behind his pillar about ten feet from the spot where he and the stranger were the roof had given way leaving a large round opening through which might be seen the blue vault of heaven thickly studded with stars around this opening which had possibly for ages permitted a
