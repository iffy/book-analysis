yes a fowl peppino turning around shouted a fowl for his excellency his voice yet echoed in the archway when a handsome graceful and half-naked young man appeared bearing a fowl in a silver dish on his head without the assistance of his hands i could almost believe myself at the caf de paris murmured danglars here your excellency said peppino taking the fowl from the young bandit and placing it on the worm-eaten table which with the stool and the goat-skin bed formed the entire furniture of the cell danglars asked for a knife and fork here excellency said peppino offering him a little blunt knife and a boxwood fork danglars took the knife in one hand and the fork in the other and was about to cut up the fowl pardon me excellency said peppino placing his hand on the bankers shoulder people pay here before they eat they might not be satisfied and ah ha thought danglars this is not so much like paris except that i shall probably be skinned never mind ill fix that all right i have always heard how cheap poultry is in italy i should think a fowl is worth about twelve sous at rome there he said throwing a louis down peppino picked up the louis and danglars again prepared to carve the fowl stay a moment your excellency said peppino rising you still owe me something i said they would skin me thought danglars but resolving to resist the extortion he said come how much do i owe you for this fowl your excellency has given me a louis on account a louis on account for a fowl certainly and your excellency now owes me louis danglars opened his enormous eyes on hearing this gigantic joke very droll he muttered very droll indeed and he again began to carve the fowl when peppino stopped the barons right hand with his left and held out his other hand come now he said is it not a joke said danglars we never joke replied peppino solemn as a quaker what a hundred thousand francs for a fowl ah excellency you cannot imagine how hard it is to rear fowls in these horrible caves come come this is very droll very amusing i allow but as i am very hungry pray allow me to eat stay here is another louis for you then that will make only louis more said peppino with the same indifference i shall get them all in time oh as for that said danglars angry at this prolongation of the jest as for that you wont get them at all go to the devil you do not know with whom you have to deal m peppino made a sign and the youth hastily removed the fowl danglars threw himself upon his goat-skin and peppino reclosing the door again began eating his peas and bacon though danglars could not see peppino the noise of his teeth allowed no doubt as to his occupation he was certainly eating and noisily too like an ill-bred man brute said danglars peppino pretended not to hear him and without even turning his head continued to eat slowly danglars stomach felt so empty that it seemed as if it would be impossible ever to fill it again still he had patience for another half-hour which appeared to him like a century he again arose and went to the door come sir do not keep me starving here any longer but tell me what they want nay your excellency it is you who should tell us what you want give your orders and we will execute them then open the door directly peppino obeyed now look here i want something to eat to eat do you hear are you hungry come you understand me what would your excellency like to eat a piece of dry bread since the fowls are beyond all price in this accursed place bread very well holloa there some bread he called the youth brought a small loaf how much asked danglars four thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight louis said peppino you have paid two louis in advance m what one hundred thousand francs for a loaf one hundred thousand francs repeated peppino but you only asked francs for a fowl we have a fixed price for all our provisions it signifies nothing whether you eat much or little whether you have ten dishes or one it is always the same price what still keeping up this silly jest my dear fellow it is perfectly ridiculous stupid you had better tell me at once that you intend starving me to death oh dear no your excellency unless you intend to commit suicide pay and eat and what am i to pay with brute said danglars enraged do you suppose i carry francs in my pocket your excellency has francs in your pocket that will be fifty fowls at francs apiece and half a fowl for the danglars shuddered the bandage fell from his eyes and he understood the joke which he did not think quite so stupid as he had done just before come he said if i pay you the francs will you be satisfied and allow me to eat at my ease certainly said peppino but how can i pay them oh nothing easier you have an account open with messrs thomson
