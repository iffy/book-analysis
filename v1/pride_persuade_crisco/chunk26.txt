interruption that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts but with him i believe it does not often happen the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chooses to be seen i should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be an ill-tempered man wickham only shook his head i wonder said he at the next opportunity of speaking whether he is likely to be in this country much longer i do not at all know but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield i hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood oh no it is not for me to be driven away by mr darcy if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go we are not on friendly terms and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim before all the world a sense of very great ill-usage and most painful regrets at his being what he is his father miss bennet the late mr darcy was one of the best men that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had and i can never be in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections his behaviour to myself has been scandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him anything and everything rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented further enquiry mr wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton the neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen and speaking of the latter with gentle but very intelligible gallantry it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added which was my chief inducement to enter the shire i knew it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintances meryton had procured them society i own is necessary to me i have been a disappointed man and my spirits will not bear solitude i must have employment and society a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have now made it eligible the church ought to have been my profession i was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now indeed yes the late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift he was my godfather and excessively attached to me i cannot do justice to his kindness he meant to provide for me amply and thought he had done it but when the living fell it was given elsewhere good heavens cried elizabeth but how could that be how could his will be disregarded why did you not seek legal redress there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but mr darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance imprudence in short anything or nothing certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it i have a warm unguarded temper and i may have spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely i can recall nothing worse but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me this is quite shocking he deserves to be publicly disgraced some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me till i can forget his father i can never defy or expose him elizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them but what said she after a pause can have been his motive what can have induced him to behave so cruelly a thorough determined dislike of me a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy had the late mr darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his fathers uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me i had not thought mr darcy so bad as this though i have never liked him i had not thought so very ill of him i had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general but did not suspect him of descending to such
