he was a favorite with cucumetto as he had for three years faithfully served him and as he had saved his life by shooting a dragoon who was about to cut him down he hoped the chief would have pity on him he took cucumetto one side while the young girl seated at the foot of a huge pine that stood in the centre of the forest made a veil of her picturesque head-dress to hide her face from the lascivious gaze of the bandits there he told the chief all his affection for the prisoner their promises of mutual fidelity and how every night since he had been near they had met in some neighboring ruins m it so happened that night that cucumetto had sent carlini to a village so that he had been unable to go to the place of meeting cucumetto had been there however by accident as he said and had carried the maiden off carlini besought his chief to make an exception in ritas favor as her father was rich and could pay a large ransom cucumetto seemed to yield to his friends entreaties and bade him find a shepherd to send to ritas father at frosinone carlini flew joyfully to rita telling her she was saved and bidding her write to her father to inform him what had occurred and that her ransom was fixed at three hundred piastres twelve hours delay was all that was granted that is until nine the next morning the instant the letter was written carlini seized it and hastened to the plain to find a messenger he found a young shepherd watching his flock the natural messengers of the bandits are the shepherds who live between the city and the mountains between civilized and savage life the boy undertook the commission promising to be in frosinone in less than an hour carlini returned anxious to see his mistress and announce the joyful intelligence he found the troop in the glade supping off the provisions exacted as contributions from the peasants but his eye vainly sought rita and cucumetto among them he inquired where they were and was answered by a burst of laughter a cold perspiration burst from every pore and his hair stood on end he repeated his question one of the bandits rose and offered him a glass filled with orvietto saying to the health of the brave cucumetto and the fair rita at this moment carlini heard a womans cry he divined the truth seized the glass broke it across the face of him who presented it and rushed towards the spot whence the cry came after a hundred yards he turned the corner of the thicket he found rita senseless in the arms of cucumetto at the sight of carlini cucumetto rose a pistol in each hand the two brigands looked at each other for a moment the one with a smile of lasciviousness on his lips the other with the pallor of death on his brow a terrible battle between the two men seemed imminent but by degrees carlinis features relaxed his hand which had grasped one of the pistols in his belt fell to his side rita lay between them the moon lighted the group well said cucumetto have you executed your commission yes captain returned carlini at nine oclock tomorrow ritas father will be here with the money it is well in the meantime we will have a merry night this young girl is charming and does credit to your taste now as i am not egotistical we will return to our comrades and draw lots for her you have determined then to abandon her to the common law said carlini why should an exception be made in her favor i thought that my entreaties what right have you any more than the rest to ask for an exception it is true but never mind continued cucumetto laughing sooner or later your turn will come carlinis teeth clenched convulsively now then said cucumetto advancing towards the other bandits are you coming i follow you m cucumetto departed without losing sight of carlini for doubtless he feared lest he should strike him unawares but nothing betrayed a hostile design on carlinis part he was standing his arms folded near rita who was still insensible cucumetto fancied for a moment the young man was about to take her in his arms and fly but this mattered little to him now rita had been his and as for the money three hundred piastres distributed among the band was so small a sum that he cared little about it he continued to follow the path to the glade but to his great surprise carlini arrived almost as soon as himself let us draw lots let us draw lots cried all the brigands when they saw the chief their demand was fair and the chief inclined his head in sign of acquiescence the eyes of all shone fiercely as they made their demand and the red light of the fire made them look like demons the names of all including carlini were placed in a hat and the youngest of the band drew forth a ticket the ticket bore the name of diavolaccio he was the man who had proposed to carlini the health of their chief and to whom carlini replied by breaking the glass across
