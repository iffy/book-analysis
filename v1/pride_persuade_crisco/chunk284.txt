to the people then a constitution then liberty ah my friend said the abb turning towards dants and surveying him with the kindling gaze of a prophet you are young you will see all this come to pass probably if ever i get out of prison true replied faria we are prisoners but i forget this sometimes and there are even moments when my mental vision transports me beyond these walls and i fancy myself at liberty but wherefore are you here because in i dreamed of the very plan napoleon tried to realize in because like machiavelli i desired to alter the political face of italy and instead of allowing it to be split up into a quantity of petty principalities each held by some weak or tyrannical ruler i sought to form one large compact and powerful empire and lastly because i fancied i had found my csar borgia in a crowned simpleton who feigned to enter into my views only to betray me it was the plan of alexander vi and clement vii but it will never succeed now for they attempted it fruitlessly and napoleon was unable to complete his work italy seems fated to misfortune and the old man bowed his head dants could not understand a man risking his life for such matters napoleon certainly he knew something of inasmuch as he had seen and spoken with him but of clement vii and alexander vi he knew nothing are you not he asked the priest who here in the chteau dif is generally thought to be ill mad you mean dont you i did not like to say so answered dants smiling well then resumed faria with a bitter smile let me answer your question in full by acknowledging that i am the poor mad prisoner of the chteau dif for many years permitted to amuse the different visitors with what is said to be my insanity and in all probability i should be promoted to the honor of making sport for the children if such innocent beings could be found in an abode devoted like this to suffering and despair dants remained for a short time mute and motionless at length he said then you abandon all hope of escape i perceive its utter impossibility and i consider it impious to attempt that which the almighty evidently does not approve nay be not discouraged would it not be expecting too much to hope to succeed at your first attempt why not try to find an opening in another direction from that which has so unfortunately failed alas it shows how little notion you can have of all it has cost me to effect a purpose so unexpectedly frustrated that you talk of beginning over again in the first place i was four years making the tools i possess and have been two years scraping and digging out earth hard as granite itself then what toil and fatigue has it not been to remove huge stones i should once have deemed impossible to loosen whole days have i passed in these titanic efforts considering my labor well repaid if by night-time i had contrived to carry away a square inch of this hard-bound cement changed by ages into a substance unyielding as the stones themselves then to conceal the mass of earth and rubbish i dug up i was compelled to break through a staircase and throw the fruits of my labor into the hollow part of it but the well is now so completely choked up that i scarcely think it would be possible to add another handful of dust without leading to discovery consider also that i fully believed i had accomplished the end and aim of my undertaking for which i had so exactly husbanded my strength as to make it just hold out to the termination of my enterprise and now at the moment when i reckoned upon success my hopes are forever dashed from me no i repeat again that nothing shall induce me to renew attempts evidently at variance with the almightys pleasure dants held down his head that the other might not see how joy at the thought of having a companion outweighed the sympathy he felt for the failure of the abbs plans the abb sank upon edmonds bed while edmond himself remained standing escape had never once occurred to him there are indeed some things which appear so impossible that the mind does not dwell on them for an instant to undermine the ground for fifty feet to devote three years to a labor which if successful would conduct you to a precipice overhanging the sea to plunge into the waves from the height of fifty sixty perhaps a hundred feet at the risk of being dashed to pieces against the rocks should you have been fortunate enough to have escaped the fire of the sentinels and even supposing all these perils past then to have to swim for your life a distance of at least three miles ere you could reach the shore were difficulties so startling and formidable that dants had never even dreamed of such a scheme resigning himself rather to death but the sight of an old man clinging to life with so desperate a courage gave a fresh turn to his ideas and inspired him with new courage another older and less
