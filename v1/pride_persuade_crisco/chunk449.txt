of danglars as he passed them he said they are extremely handsome certainly and you have done well to purchase them although you were somewhat remiss not to have procured them sooner indeed your excellency i had very considerable difficulty in obtaining them and as it is they have cost an enormous price does the sum you gave for them make the animals less beautiful inquired the count shrugging his shoulders nay if your excellency is satisfied it is all that i could wish whither does your excellency desire to be driven to the residence of baron danglars rue de la chausse dantin this conversation had passed as they stood upon the terrace from which a flight of stone steps led to the carriage-drive as bertuccio with a respectful bow was moving away the count called him back i have another commission for you m bertuccio said he i am desirous of having an estate by the seaside in normandy for instance between le havre and boulogne you see i give you a wide range it will be absolutely necessary that the place you may select have a small harbor creek or bay into which my corvette can enter and remain at anchor she draws only fifteen feet she must be kept in constant readiness to sail immediately i think proper to give the signal make the requisite inquiries for a place of this description and when you have met with an eligible spot visit it and if it possess the advantages desired purchase it at once in your own name the corvette must now i think be on her way to fcamp must she not m certainly your excellency i saw her put to sea the same evening we quitted marseilles and the yacht was ordered to remain at martigues tis well i wish you to write from time to time to the captains in charge of the two vessels so as to keep them on the alert and the steamboat she is at chlons yes the same orders for her as for the two sailing vessels very good when you have purchased the estate i desire i want constant relays of horses at ten leagues apart along the northern and southern road your excellency may depend upon me the count made a gesture of satisfaction descended the terrace steps and sprang into his carriage which was whirled along swiftly to the bankers house danglars was engaged at that moment presiding over a railroad committee but the meeting was nearly concluded when the name of his visitor was announced as the counts title sounded on his ear he rose and addressing his colleagues who were members of one or the other chamber he said gentlemen pardon me for leaving you so abruptly but a most ridiculous circumstance has occurred which is this thomson french the roman bankers have sent to me a certain person calling himself the count of monte cristo and have given him an unlimited credit with me i confess this is the drollest thing i have ever met with in the course of my extensive foreign transactions and you may readily suppose it has greatly roused my curiosity i took the trouble this morning to call on the pretended count if he were a real count he wouldnt be so rich but would you believe it he was not receiving so the master of monte cristo gives himself airs befitting a great millionaire or a capricious beauty i made inquiries and found that the house in the champs-lyses is his own property and certainly it was very decently kept up but pursued danglars with one of his sinister smiles an order for unlimited credit calls for something like caution on the part of the banker to whom that order is given i am very anxious to see this man i suspect a hoax is intended but the instigators of it little knew whom they had to deal with they laugh best who laugh last having delivered himself of this pompous address uttered with a degree of energy that left the baron almost out of breath he bowed to the assembled party and withdrew to his drawing-room whose sumptuous furnishings of white and gold had caused a great sensation in the chausse dantin it was to this apartment he had desired his guest to be shown with the purpose of overwhelming him at the sight of so much luxury he found the count standing before some copies of albano and fattore that had been passed off to the banker as originals but which mere copies as they were seemed to feel their degradation in being brought into juxtaposition with the gaudy colors that covered the ceiling the count turned round as he heard the entrance of danglars into the room with a slight inclination of the head danglars signed to the count to be seated pointing significantly to a gilded armchair covered with white satin embroidered with gold the count sat down m i have the honor i presume of addressing m de monte cristo the count bowed and i of speaking to baron danglars chevalier of the legion of honor and member of the chamber of deputies monte cristo repeated all the titles he had read on the barons card danglars felt the irony and compressed his lips you will i trust excuse me monsieur for not calling
