bear the cold better you are mistaken for i have made a vow never to return to africa you were very much frightened then asked beauchamp well yes and i had good reason to be so replied chteau-renaud i was retreating on foot for my horse was dead six arabs came up full gallop to cut off my head i shot two with my double-barrelled gun and two more with my pistols but i was then disarmed and two were still left one seized me by the hair that is why i now wear it so short for no one knows what may happen the other swung a yataghan and i already felt the cold steel on my neck when this gentleman whom you see here charged them shot the one who held me by the hair and cleft the skull of the other with his sabre he had assigned himself the task of saving a mans life that day chance caused that man to be myself when i am rich i will order a statue of chance from klagmann or marochetti yes said morrel smiling it was the th of september the anniversary of the day on which my father was miraculously preserved therefore as far as it lies in my power i endeavor to celebrate it by some m heroic action interrupted chteau-renaud i was chosen but that is not all after rescuing me from the sword he rescued me from the cold not by sharing his cloak with me like st martin but by giving me the whole then from hunger by sharing with me guess what a strasbourg pie asked beauchamp no his horse of which we each of us ate a slice with a hearty appetite it was very hard the horse said morcerf laughing no the sacrifice returned chteau-renaud ask debray if he would sacrifice his english steed for a stranger not for a stranger said debray but for a friend i might perhaps i divined that you would become mine count replied morrel besides as i had the honor to tell you heroism or not sacrifice or not that day i owed an offering to bad fortune in recompense for the favors good fortune had on other days granted to us the history to which m morrel alludes continued chteau-renaud is an admirable one which he will tell you some day when you are better acquainted with him today let us fill our stomachs and not our memories what time do you breakfast albert at half-past ten precisely asked debray taking out his watch oh you will give me five minutes grace replied morcerf for i also expect a preserver of whom of myself cried morcerf parbleu do you think i cannot be saved as well as anyone else and that there are only arabs who cut off heads our breakfast is a philanthropic one and we shall have at table at least i hope so two benefactors of humanity what shall we do said debray we have only one monthyon prize well it will be given to someone who has done nothing to deserve it said beauchamp that is the way the academy mostly escapes from the dilemma and where does he come from asked debray you have already answered the question once but so vaguely that i venture to put it a second time really said albert i do not know when i invited him three months ago he was then at rome but since that time who knows where he may have gone and you think him capable of being exact demanded debray i think him capable of everything well with the five minutes grace we have only ten left i will profit by them to tell you something about my guest i beg pardon interrupted beauchamp are there any materials for an article in what you are going to tell us yes and for a most curious one go on then for i see i shall not get to the chamber this morning and i must make up for it i was at rome during the last carnival we know that said beauchamp yes but what you do not know is that i was carried off by bandits there are no bandits cried debray yes there are and most hideous or rather most admirable ones for i found them ugly enough to frighten me come my dear albert said debray confess that your cook is behindhand that the oysters have not arrived from ostend or marennes and that like madame de maintenon you are going to replace the dish by a story say so at once we are sufficiently well-bred to excuse you and to listen to your history fabulous as it promises to be and i say to you fabulous as it may seem i tell it as a true one from beginning to end the brigands had carried me off and conducted me to a gloomy spot called the catacombs of saint sebastian i know it said chteau-renaud i narrowly escaped catching a fever there and i did more than that replied morcerf for i caught one i was informed that i was prisoner until i paid the sum of roman crowns about francs unfortunately i had not above i was at the end of my journey and of my credit i wrote to franz and were he here
