have left her let me hasten to add continued he that the testator having only the right to alienate a part of his fortune and having alienated it all the will will not bear scrutiny and is declared null and void yes said villefort but i warn m dpinay that during my life-time my fathers will shall never be questioned my position forbidding any doubt to be entertained m sir said franz i regret much that such a question has been raised in the presence of mademoiselle valentine i have never inquired the amount of her fortune which however limited it may be exceeds mine my family has sought consideration in this alliance with m de villefort all i seek is happiness valentine imperceptibly thanked him while two silent tears rolled down her cheeks besides sir said villefort addressing himself to his future son-in-law excepting the loss of a portion of your hopes this unexpected will need not personally wound you m noirtiers weakness of mind sufficiently explains it it is not because mademoiselle valentine is going to marry you that he is angry but because she will marry a union with any other would have caused him the same sorrow old age is selfish sir and mademoiselle de villefort has been a faithful companion to m noirtier which she cannot be when she becomes the baroness dpinay my fathers melancholy state prevents our speaking to him on any subjects which the weakness of his mind would incapacitate him from understanding and i am perfectly convinced that at the present time although he knows that his granddaughter is going to be married m noirtier has even forgotten the name of his intended grandson m de villefort had scarcely said this when the door opened and barrois appeared gentlemen said he in a tone strangely firm for a servant speaking to his masters under such solemn circumstances gentlemen m noirtier de villefort wishes to speak immediately to m franz de quesnel baron dpinay he as well as the notary that there might be no mistake in the person gave all his titles to the bridegroom elect villefort started madame de villefort let her son slip from her knees valentine rose pale and dumb as a statue albert and chteau-renaud exchanged a second look more full of amazement than the first the notary looked at villefort it is impossible said the procureur m dpinay cannot leave the drawing-room at present it is at this moment replied barrois with the same firmness that m noirtier my master wishes to speak on important subjects to m franz dpinay grandpapa noirtier can speak now then said edward with his habitual quickness however his remark did not make madame de villefort even smile so much was every mind engaged and so solemn was the situation tell m nortier resumed villefort that what he demands is impossible then m nortier gives notice to these gentlemen replied barrois that he will give orders to be carried to the drawing-room astonishment was at its height something like a smile was perceptible on madame de villeforts countenance valentine instinctively raised her eyes as if to thank heaven pray go valentine said m de villefort and see what this new fancy of your grandfathers is valentine rose quickly and was hastening joyfully towards the door when m de villefort altered his intention stop said he i will go with you excuse me sir said franz since m noirtier sent for me i am ready to attend to his wish besides i shall be happy to pay my respects to him not having yet had the honor of doing so pray sir said villefort with marked uneasiness do not disturb yourself m forgive me sir said franz in a resolute tone i would not lose this opportunity of proving to m noirtier how wrong it would be of him to encourage feelings of dislike to me which i am determined to conquer whatever they may be by my devotion and without listening to villefort he arose and followed valentine who was running downstairs with the joy of a shipwrecked mariner who finds a rock to cling to m de villefort followed them chteau-renaud and morcerf exchanged a third look of still increasing wonder chapter a signed statement noirtier was prepared to receive them dressed in black and installed in his armchair when the three persons he expected had entered he looked at the door which his valet immediately closed listen whispered villefort to valentine who could not conceal her joy if m noirtier wishes to communicate anything which would delay your marriage i forbid you to understand him valentine blushed but did not answer villefort approached noirtier here is m franz dpinay said he you requested to see him we have all wished for this interview and i trust it will convince you how ill-formed are your objections to valentines marriage noirtier answered only by a look which made villeforts blood run cold he motioned to valentine to approach in a moment thanks to her habit of conversing with her grandfather she understood that he asked for a key then his eye was fixed on the drawer of a small chest
