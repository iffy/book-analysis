voice i am he what is your pleasure with me edmond dants replied the magistrate i arrest you in the name of the law me repeated edmond slightly changing color and wherefore i pray i cannot inform you but you will be duly acquainted with the reasons that have rendered such a step necessary at the preliminary examination m morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was useless he saw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law and perfectly well knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate decked with his official scarf as to address a petition to some cold marble effigy old dants however sprang forward there are situations which the heart of a father or a mother cannot be made to understand he prayed and supplicated in terms so moving that even the officer was touched and although firm in his duty he kindly said my worthy friend let me beg of you to calm your apprehensions your son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his cargo and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly he has given the information required whether touching the health of his crew or the value of his freight what is the meaning of all this inquired caderousse frowningly of danglars who had assumed an air of utter surprise m how can i tell you replied he i am like yourself utterly bewildered at all that is going on and cannot in the least make out what it is about caderousse then looked around for fernand but he had disappeared the scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with startling clearness the painful catastrophe he had just witnessed appeared effectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication of the evening before had raised between himself and his memory so so said he in a hoarse and choking voice to danglars this then i suppose is a part of the trick you were concerting yesterday all i can say is that if it be so tis an ill turn and well deserves to bring double evil on those who have projected it nonsense returned danglars i tell you again i have nothing whatever to do with it besides you know very well that i tore the paper to pieces no you did not answered caderousse you merely threw it by i saw it lying in a corner hold your tongue you fool what should you know about it why you were drunk where is fernand inquired caderousse how do i know replied danglars gone as every prudent man ought to be to look after his own affairs most likely never mind where he is let you and i go and see what is to be done for our poor friends during this conversation dants after having exchanged a cheerful shake of the hand with all his sympathizing friends had surrendered himself to the officer sent to arrest him merely saying make yourselves quite easy my good fellows there is some little mistake to clear up thats all depend upon it and very likely i may not have to go so far as the prison to effect that m oh to be sure responded danglars who had now approached the group nothing more than a mistake i feel quite certain dants descended the staircase preceded by the magistrate and followed by the soldiers a carriage awaited him at the door he got in followed by two soldiers and the magistrate and the vehicle drove off towards marseilles adieu adieu dearest edmond cried mercds stretching out her arms to him from the balcony the prisoner heard the cry which sounded like the sob of a broken heart and leaning from the coach he called out good-bye mercds we shall soon meet again then the vehicle disappeared round one of the turnings of fort saint nicholas wait for me here all of you cried m morrel i will take the first conveyance i find and hurry to marseilles whence i will bring you word how all is going on thats right exclaimed a multitude of voices go and return as quickly as you can this second departure was followed by a long and fearful state of terrified silence on the part of those who were left behind the old father and mercds remained for some time apart each absorbed in grief but at length the two poor victims of the same blow raised their eyes and with a simultaneous burst of feeling rushed into each others arms meanwhile fernand made his appearance poured out for himself a glass of water with a trembling hand then hastily swallowing it went to sit down at the first vacant place and this was by mere chance placed next to the seat on which poor mercds had fallen half fainting when released from the warm and affectionate embrace of old dants instinctively fernand drew back his chair he is the cause of all this misery i am quite sure of it whispered caderousse who had never taken his eyes off fernand to danglars i dont think so answered the other hes too stupid to imagine such a scheme i only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of whoever wrought it you dont mention those who aided and abetted
