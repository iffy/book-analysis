passed through it was again shut without losing sight of her for an instant the concierge took a whistle from his pocket as soon as they entered the court and blew it the valet de chambre appeared on the door-steps you will excuse this poor fellow madame he said as he preceded the baroness but his orders are precise and m de villefort begged me to tell you that he could not act otherwise in the court showing his merchandise was a tradesman who had been admitted with the same precautions the baroness ascended the steps she felt herself strongly infected with the sadness which seemed to magnify her own and still guided by the valet de chambre who never lost sight of her for an instant she was introduced to the magistrates study preoccupied as madame danglars had been with the object of her visit the treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so insulting that she began by complaining of it but villefort raising his head bowed down by grief looked up at her with so sad a smile that her complaints died upon her lips forgive my servants he said for a terror i cannot blame them for from being suspected they have become suspicious madame danglars had often heard of the terror to which the magistrate alluded but without the evidence of her own eyesight she could never have believed that the sentiment had been carried so far you too then are unhappy she said yes madame replied the magistrate then you pity me sincerely madame and you understand what brings me here you wish to speak to me about the circumstance which has just happened yes sir a fearful misfortune you mean a mischance a mischance repeated the baroness alas madame said the procureur with his imperturbable calmness of manner i consider those alone misfortunes which are irreparable and do you suppose this will be forgotten everything will be forgotten madame said villefort your daughter will be married tomorrow if not today in a week if not tomorrow and i do not think you can regret the intended husband of your daughter madame danglars gazed on villefort stupefied to find him so almost insultingly calm am i come to a friend she asked in a tone full of mournful dignity you know that you are madame said villefort whose pale cheeks became slightly flushed as he gave her the assurance and truly this assurance carried him back to different events from those now occupying the baroness and him well then be more affectionate my dear villefort said the baroness speak to me not as a magistrate but as a friend and when i am in bitter anguish of spirit do not tell me that i ought to be gay villefort bowed when i hear misfortunes named madame he said i have within the last few months contracted the bad habit of thinking of my own and then i cannot help drawing up an egotistical parallel in my mind that is the reason that by the side of my misfortunes yours appear to me mere mischances that is why my dreadful position makes yours appear enviable but this annoys you let us change the subject you were saying madame i came to ask you my friend said the baroness what will be done with this impostor impostor repeated villefort certainly madame you appear to extenuate some cases and exaggerate others impostor indeed m andrea cavalcanti or rather m benedetto is nothing more nor less than an assassin sir i do not deny the justice of your correction but the more severely you arm yourself against that unfortunate man the more deeply will you strike our family come forget him for a moment and instead of pursuing him let him go you are too late madame the orders are issued well should he be arrested do they think they will arrest him i hope so if they should arrest him i know that sometimes prisons afford means of escape will you leave him in prison the procureur shook his head at least keep him there till my daughter be married impossible madame justice has its formalities what even for me said the baroness half jesting half in earnest for all even for myself among the rest replied villefort m ah exclaimed the baroness without expressing the ideas which the exclamation betrayed villefort looked at her with that piercing glance which reads the secrets of the heart yes i know what you mean he said you refer to the terrible rumors spread abroad in the world that the deaths which have kept me in mourning for the last three months and from

help thinking of it and saying to yourself you who pursue crime so vindictively answer now why are there unpunished crimes in your dwelling the baroness became pale you were saying this were you not well i own it i will answer you villefort drew his armchair nearer to madame danglars then resting both hands upon his desk he said in a voice more hollow than usual there are crimes which remain
