of society which every gentleman looks upon as a duty albert summoned his servant and ordered him to acquaint m and madame de morcerf of the arrival of the count of monte cristo albert followed him with the count when they arrived at the antechamber above the door was visible a shield which by its rich ornaments and its harmony with the rest of the furniture indicated the importance the owner attached to this blazon monte cristo stopped and examined it attentively azure seven merlets or placed bender said he these are doubtless your family arms except the knowledge of blazons that enables me to decipher them i am very ignorant of heraldry i a count of a fresh creation fabricated in tuscany by the aid of a commandery of st stephen and who would not have taken the trouble had i not been told that when you travel much it is necessary besides you must have something on the panels of your carriage to escape being searched by the custom-house officers excuse my putting such a question to you it is not indiscreet returned morcerf with the simplicity of conviction you have guessed rightly these are our arms that is those of my father but they are as you see joined to another shield which has gules a silver tower which are my mothers by her side i am spanish but the family of morcerf is french and i have heard one of the oldest of the south of france yes replied monte cristo these blazons prove that almost all the armed pilgrims that went to the holy land took for their arms either a cross in honor of their mission or birds of passage in sign of the long voyage they were about to undertake and which they hoped to accomplish on the wings of faith one of your ancestors had joined the crusades and supposing it to be only that of st louis that makes you mount to the thirteenth century which is tolerably ancient it is possible said morcerf my father has in his study a genealogical tree which will tell you all that and on which i made commentaries that would have greatly edified dhozier and jaucourt at present i no longer think of it and yet i must tell you that we are beginning to occupy ourselves greatly with these things under our popular government well then your government would do well to choose from the past something better than the things that i have noticed on your monuments and which have no heraldic meaning whatever as for you viscount continued monte cristo to morcerf you are more fortunate than the government for your arms are really beautiful and speak to the imagination yes you are at once from provence and spain that explains if the portrait you showed me be like the dark hue i so much admired on the visage of the noble catalan it would have required the penetration of dipus or the sphinx to have divined the irony the count concealed beneath these words apparently uttered with the greatest politeness morcerf thanked him with a smile and pushed open the door above which were his arms and which as we have said opened into the salon in the most conspicuous part of the salon was another portrait it was that of a man from five to eight-and-thirty in the uniform of a general officer wearing the double epaulet of heavy bullion that indicates superior rank the ribbon of the legion of honor around his neck which showed he was a commander and on the right breast the star of a grand officer of the order of the saviour and on the left that of the grand cross of charles iii which proved that the person represented by the picture had served in the wars of greece and spain or what was just the same thing as regarded decorations had fulfilled some diplomatic mission in the two countries monte cristo was engaged in examining this portrait with no less care than he had bestowed upon the other when another door opened and he found himself opposite to the count of morcerf in person he was a man of forty to forty-five years but he seemed at least fifty and his black moustache and eyebrows contrasted strangely with his almost white hair which was cut short in the military fashion he was dressed in plain clothes and wore at his button-hole the ribbons of the different orders to which he belonged he entered with a tolerably dignified step and some little haste monte cristo saw him advance towards him without making a single step it seemed as if his feet were rooted to the ground and his eyes on the count of morcerf father said the young man i have the honor of presenting to you the count of monte cristo the generous friend whom i had the good fortune to meet in the critical situation of which i have told you you are most welcome monsieur said the count of morcerf saluting monte cristo with a smile and monsieur has rendered our house in preserving its only heir a service which insures him our eternal gratitude as he said these words the count of morcerf pointed to a chair while he seated himself in another opposite the window monte cristo in taking the
