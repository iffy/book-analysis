the light came and to all the excitement of his dream succeeded the calmness of reality he found that he was in a grotto went towards the opening and through a kind of fanlight saw a blue sea and an azure sky the air and water were shining in the beams of the morning sun on the shore the sailors were sitting chatting and laughing and at ten yards from them the boat was at anchor undulating gracefully on the water there for some time he enjoyed the fresh breeze which played on his brow and listened to the dash of the waves on the beach that left against the rocks a lace of foam as white as silver he was for some time without reflection or thought for the divine charm which is in the things of nature specially after a fantastic dream then gradually this view of the outer world so calm so pure so grand reminded him of the illusiveness of his vision and once more awakened memory he recalled his arrival on the island his presentation to a smuggler chief a subterranean palace full of splendor an excellent supper and a spoonful of hashish it seemed however even in the very face of open day that at least a year had elapsed since all these things had passed so deep was the impression made in his mind by the dream and so strong a hold had it taken of his imagination thus every now and then he saw in fancy amid the sailors seated on a rock or undulating in the vessel one of the shadows which had shared his dream with looks and kisses otherwise his head was perfectly clear and his body refreshed he was free from the slightest headache on the contrary he felt a certain degree of lightness a faculty for absorbing the pure air and enjoying the bright sunshine more vividly than ever he went gayly up to the sailors who rose as soon as they perceived him and the patron accosting him said the signor sinbad has left his compliments for your excellency and desires us to express the regret he feels at not being able to take his leave in person but he trusts you will excuse him as very important business calls him to malaga so then gaetano said franz this is then all reality there exists a man who has received me in this island entertained me right royally and has departed while i was asleep he exists as certainly as that you may see his small yacht with all her sails spread and if you will use your glass you will in all probability recognize your host in the midst of his crew so saying gaetano pointed in a direction in which a small vessel was making sail towards the southern point of corsica franz adjusted his telescope and directed it towards the yacht gaetano was not mistaken at the stern the mysterious stranger was standing up looking towards the shore and holding a spy-glass in his hand he was attired as he had been on the previous evening and waved his pocket-handkerchief to his guest in token of adieu franz returned the salute by shaking his handkerchief as an exchange of signals after a second a slight cloud of smoke was seen at the stern of the vessel which rose gracefully as it expanded in the air and then franz heard a slight report there do you hear observed gaetano he is bidding you adieu the young man took his carbine and fired it in the air but without any idea that the noise could be heard at the distance which separated the yacht from the shore what are your excellencys orders inquired gaetano in the first place light me a torch ah yes i understand replied the patron to find the entrance to the enchanted apartment with much pleasure your excellency if it would amuse you and i will get you the torch you ask for but i too have had the idea you have and two or three times the same fancy has come over me but i have always given it up giovanni light a torch he added and give it to his excellency giovanni obeyed franz took the lamp and entered the subterranean grotto followed by gaetano he recognized the place where he had awaked by the bed of heather that was there but it was in vain that he carried his torch all round the exterior surface of the grotto he saw nothing unless that by traces of smoke others had before him attempted the same thing and like him in vain yet he did not leave a foot of this granite wall as impenetrable as futurity without strict scrutiny he did not see a fissure without introducing the blade of his hunting sword into it or a projecting point on which he did not lean and press in the hopes it would give way all was vain and he lost two hours in his attempts which were at last utterly useless at the end of this time he gave up his search and gaetano smiled when franz appeared again on the shore the yacht only seemed like a small white speck on the horizon he looked again through his glass but even then he could not distinguish anything gaetano reminded him
