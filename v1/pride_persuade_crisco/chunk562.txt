on you valentine said morrel all you do will be well done only if they disregard your prayers if your father and madame de saint-mran insist that m dpinay should be called tomorrow to sign the contract then you have my promise maximilian instead of signing i will go to you and we will fly but from this moment until then let us not tempt providence let us not see each other it is a miracle it is a providence that we have not been discovered if we were surprised if it were known that we met thus we should have no further resource you are right valentine but how shall i ascertain from the notary m deschamps i know him and for myself i will write to you depend on me i dread this marriage maximilian as much as you thank you my adored valentine thank you that is enough when once i know the hour i will hasten to this spot you can easily get over this fence with my assistance a carriage will await us at the gate in which you will accompany me to my sisters there living retired or mingling in society as you wish we shall be enabled to use our power to resist oppression and not suffer ourselves to be put to death like sheep which only defend themselves by sighs yes said valentine i will now acknowledge you are right maximilian and now are you satisfied with your betrothal said the young girl sorrowfully my adored valentine words cannot express one half of my satisfaction valentine had approached or rather had placed her lips so near the fence that they nearly touched those of morrel which were pressed against the other side of the cold and inexorable barrier adieu then till we meet again said valentine tearing herself away i shall hear from you yes thanks thanks dear love adieu the sound of a kiss was heard and valentine fled through the avenue morrel listened to catch the last sound of her dress brushing the branches and of her footstep on the gravel then raised his eyes with an ineffable smile of thankfulness to heaven for being permitted to be thus loved and then also disappeared the young man returned home and waited all the evening and all the next day without getting any message it was only on the following day at about ten oclock in the morning as he was starting to call on m deschamps the notary that he received from the postman a small billet which he knew to be from valentine although he had not before seen her writing it was to this effect tears entreaties prayers have availed me nothing yesterday for two hours i was at the church of saint-philippe-du-roule and for two hours i prayed most fervently heaven is as inflexible as man and the signature of the contract is fixed for this evening at nine oclock i have but one promise and but one heart to give that promise is pledged to you that heart is also yours this evening then at a quarter to nine at the gate your betrothed valentine de villefort ps my poor grandmother gets worse and worse yesterday her fever amounted to delirium today her delirium is almost madness you will be very kind to me will you not morrel to make me forget my sorrow in leaving her thus i think it is kept a secret from grandpapa noirtier that the contract is to be signed this evening morrel went also to the notary who confirmed the news that the contract was to be signed that evening then he went to call on monte cristo and heard still more franz had been to announce the ceremony and madame de villefort had also written to beg the count to excuse her not inviting him the death of m de saint-mran and the dangerous illness of his widow would cast a gloom over the meeting which she would regret should be shared by the count whom she wished every happiness the day before franz had been presented to madame de saint-mran who had left her bed to receive him but had been obliged to return to it immediately after it is easy to suppose that morrels agitation would not escape the counts penetrating eye monte cristo was more affectionate than ever indeed his manner was so kind that several times morrel was on the point of telling him all but he recalled the promise he had made to valentine and kept his secret the young man read valentines letter twenty times in the course of the day it was her first and on what an occasion each time he read it he renewed his vow to make her happy how great is the power of a woman who has made so courageous a resolution what devotion does she deserve from him for whom she has sacrificed everything how ought she really to be supremely loved she becomes at once a queen and a wife and it is impossible to thank and love her sufficiently morrel longed intensely for the moment when he should hear valentine say here i am maximilian come and help me he had arranged everything for her escape two ladders were hidden in the clover-field a cabriolet was ordered for maximilian alone without a servant without lights at
