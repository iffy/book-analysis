of his dinner but he insisted that his comrades who had not his reasons for fasting should have their meal as for himself he declared that he had only need of a little rest and that when they returned he should be easier the sailors did not require much urging they were hungry and the smell of the roasted kid was very savory and your tars are not very ceremonious an hour afterwards they returned all that edmond had been able to do was to drag himself about a dozen paces forward to lean against a moss-grown rock but instead of growing easier dants pains appeared to increase in violence the old patron who was obliged to sail in the morning in order to land his cargo on the frontiers of piedmont and france between nice and frjus urged dants to try and rise edmond made great exertions in order to comply but at each effort he fell back moaning and turning pale he has broken his ribs said the commander in a low voice no matter he is an excellent fellow and we must not leave him we will try and carry him on board the tartan dants declared however that he would rather die where he was than undergo the agony which the slightest movement cost him well said the patron let what may happen it shall never be said that we deserted a good comrade like you we will not go till evening this very much astonished the sailors although not one opposed it the patron was so strict that this was the first time they had ever seen him give up an enterprise or even delay in its execution dants would not allow that any such infraction of regular and proper rules should be made in his favor no no he said to the patron i was awkward and it is just that i pay the penalty of my clumsiness leave me a small supply of biscuit a gun powder and balls to kill the kids or defend myself at need and a pickaxe that i may build a shelter if you delay in coming back for me but youll die of hunger said the patron i would rather do so was edmonds reply than suffer the inexpressible agonies which the slightest movement causes me the patron turned towards his vessel which was rolling on the swell in the little harbor and with sails partly set would be ready for sea when her toilet should be completed what are we to do maltese asked the captain we cannot leave you here so and yet we cannot stay go go exclaimed dants we shall be absent at least a week said the patron and then we must run out of our course to come here and take you up again why said dants if in two or three days you hail any fishing-boat desire them to come here to me i will pay twenty-five piastres for my passage back to leghorn if you do not come across one return for me the patron shook his head listen captain baldi theres one way of settling this said jacopo do you go and i will stay and take care of the wounded man and give up your share of the venture said edmond to remain with me yes said jacopo and without any hesitation you are a good fellow and a kind-hearted messmate replied edmond and heaven will recompense you for your generous intentions but i do not wish anyone to stay with me a day or two of rest will set me up and i hope i shall find among the rocks certain herbs most excellent for bruises a peculiar smile passed over dants lips he squeezed jacopos hand warmly but nothing could shake his determination to remain and remain alone the smugglers left with edmond what he had requested and set sail but not without turning about several times and each time making signs of a cordial farewell to which edmond replied with his hand only as if he could not move the rest of his body then when they had disappeared he said with a smile tis strange that it should be among such men that we find proofs of friendship and devotion then he dragged himself cautiously to the top of a rock from which he had a full view of the sea and thence he saw the tartan complete her preparations for sailing weigh anchor and balancing herself as gracefully as a water-fowl ere it takes to the wing set sail at the end of an hour she was completely out of sight at least it was impossible for the wounded man to see her any longer from the spot where he was then dants rose more agile and light than the kid among the myrtles and shrubs of these wild rocks took his gun in one hand his pickaxe in the other and hastened towards the rock on which the marks he had noted terminated and now he exclaimed remembering the tale of the arabian fisherman which faria had related to him now open sesame chapter the secret cave the sun had nearly reached the meridian and his scorching rays fell full on the rocks which seemed themselves sensible of the heat thousands of grasshoppers hidden in the bushes chirped with a monotonous and dull
