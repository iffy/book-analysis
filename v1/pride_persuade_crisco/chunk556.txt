by offering his arm to his daughter it was just in time for valentines head swam and she staggered madame de villefort instantly hastened to her assistance and aided her husband in dragging her to the carriage saying what a singular event who could have thought it ah yes it is indeed strange and the wretched family departed leaving a cloud of sadness hanging over the rest of the evening at the foot of the stairs valentine found barrois awaiting her m noirtier wishes to see you tonight he said in an undertone tell him i will come when i leave my dear grandmamma she replied feeling with true delicacy that the person to whom she could be of the most service just then was madame de saint-mran valentine found her grandmother in bed silent caresses heartwrung sobs broken sighs burning tears were all that passed in this sad interview while madame de villefort leaning on her husbands arm maintained all outward forms of respect at least towards the poor widow she soon whispered to her husband i think it would be better for me to retire with your permission for the sight of me appears still to afflict your mother-in-law madame de saint-mran heard her yes yes she said softly to valentine let her leave but do you stay madame de villefort left and valentine remained alone beside the bed for the procureur overcome with astonishment at the unexpected death had followed his wife meanwhile barrois had returned for the first time to old noirtier who having heard the noise in the house had as we have said sent his old servant to inquire the cause on his return his quick intelligent eye interrogated the messenger alas sir exclaimed barrois a great misfortune has happened madame de saint-mran has arrived and her husband is dead m de saint-mran and noirtier had never been on strict terms of friendship still the death of one old man always considerably affects another noirtier let his head fall upon his chest apparently overwhelmed and thoughtful then he closed one eye in token of inquiry barrois asked mademoiselle valentine noirtier nodded his head she is at the ball as you know since she came to say good-bye to you in full dress noirtier again closed his left eye do you wish to see her noirtier again made an affirmative sign well they have gone to fetch her no doubt from madame de morcerfs i will await her return and beg her to come up here is that what you wish for yes replied the invalid barrois therefore as we have seen watched for valentine and informed her of her grandfathers wish consequently valentine came up to noirtier on leaving madame de saint-mran who in the midst of her grief had at last yielded to fatigue and fallen into a feverish sleep within reach of her hand they placed a small table upon which stood a bottle of orangeade her usual beverage and a glass then as we have said the young girl left the bedside to see m noirtier valentine kissed the old man who looked at her with such tenderness that her eyes again filled with tears whose sources he thought must be exhausted the old gentleman continued to dwell upon her with the same expression yes yes said valentine you mean that i have yet a kind grandfather left do you not the old man intimated that such was his meaning ah yes happily i have replied valentine without that what would become of me it was one oclock in the morning barrois who wished to go to bed himself observed that after such sad events everyone stood in need of rest noirtier would not say that the only rest he needed was to see his child but wished her good-night for grief and fatigue had made her appear quite ill the next morning she found her grandmother in bed the fever had not abated on the contrary her eyes glistened and she appeared to be suffering from violent nervous irritability oh dear grandmamma are you worse exclaimed valentine perceiving all these signs of agitation no my child no said madame de saint-mran but i was impatiently waiting for your arrival that i might send for your father my father inquired valentine uneasily yes i wish to speak to him valentine durst not oppose her grandmothers wish the cause of which she did not know and an instant afterwards villefort entered sir said madame de saint-mran without using any circumlocution and as if fearing she had no time to lose you wrote to me concerning the marriage of this child yes madame replied villefort it is not only projected but arranged your intended son-in-law is named m franz dpinay yes madame is he not the son of general dpinay who was on our side and who was assassinated some days before the usurper returned from the island of elba the same does he not dislike the idea of marrying the granddaughter of a jacobin our civil dissensions are now happily extinguished mother said villefort m dpinay was quite a child when his father died he knows very little of m noirtier and will meet him if not with pleasure at least with indifference is it a suitable match in every respect and the young man is regarded with universal esteem you approve of him
