diabolical personage who would have been created by every fertile imagination if le sage had not acquired the priority in his great masterpiece would have enjoyed a singular spectacle if he had lifted up the roof of the little house in the rue saint-germain-des-prs while debray was casting up his figures above the room in which debray had been dividing two millions and a half with madame danglars was another inhabited by persons who have played too prominent a part in the incidents we have related for their appearance not to create some interest mercds and albert were in that room mercds was much changed within the last few days not that even in her days of fortune she had ever dressed with the magnificent display which makes us no longer able to recognize a woman when she appears in a plain and simple attire nor indeed had she fallen into that state of depression where it is impossible to conceal the garb of misery no the change in mercds was that her eye no longer sparkled her lips no longer smiled and there was now a hesitation in uttering the words which formerly sprang so fluently from her ready wit it was not poverty which had broken her spirit it was not a want of courage which rendered her poverty burdensome mercds although deposed from the exalted position she had occupied lost in the sphere she had now chosen like a person passing from a room splendidly lighted into utter darkness appeared like a queen fallen from her palace to a hovel and who reduced to strict necessity could neither become reconciled to the earthen vessels she was herself forced to place upon the table nor to the humble pallet which had become her bed the beautiful catalane and noble countess had lost both her proud glance and charming smile because she saw nothing but misery around her the walls were hung with one of the gray papers which economical landlords choose as not likely to show the dirt the floor was uncarpeted the furniture attracted the attention to the poor attempt at luxury indeed everything offended eyes accustomed to refinement and elegance madame de morcerf had lived there since leaving her house the continual silence of the spot oppressed her still seeing that albert continually watched her countenance to judge the state of her feelings she constrained herself to assume a monotonous smile of the lips alone which contrasted with the sweet and beaming expression that usually shone from her eyes seemed like moonlight on a statue yielding light without warmth albert too was ill at ease the remains of luxury prevented him from sinking into his actual position if he wished to go out without gloves his hands appeared too white if he wished to walk through the town his boots seemed too highly polished yet these two noble and intelligent creatures united by the indissoluble ties of maternal and filial love had succeeded in tacitly understanding one another and economizing their stores and albert had been able to tell his mother without extorting a change of countenance mother we have no more money m mercds had never known misery she had often in her youth spoken of poverty but between want and necessity those synonymous words there is a wide difference amongst the catalans mercds wished for a thousand things but still she never really wanted any so long as the nets were good they caught fish and so long as they sold their fish they were able to buy twine for new nets and then shut out from friendship having but one affection which could not be mixed up with her ordinary pursuits she thought of herself of no one but herself upon the little she earned she lived as well as she could now there were two to be supported and nothing to live upon winter approached mercds had no fire in that cold and naked room she who was accustomed to stoves which heated the house from the hall to the boudoir she had not even one little flower she whose apartment had been a conservatory of costly exotics but she had her son hitherto the excitement of fulfilling a duty had sustained them excitement like enthusiasm sometimes renders us unconscious to the things of earth but the excitement had calmed down and they felt themselves obliged to descend from dreams to reality after having exhausted the ideal they found they must talk of the actual mother exclaimed albert just as madame danglars was descending the stairs let us reckon our riches if you please i want capital to build my plans upon capital nothing replied mercds with a mournful smile no mother capital francs and i have an idea of our leading a delightful life upon this francs child sighed mercds alas dear mother said the young man i have unhappily spent too much of your money not to know the value of it these francs are enormous and i intend building upon this foundation a miraculous certainty for the future you say this my dear boy but do you think we ought to accept these francs said mercds coloring i think so answered albert in a firm tone we will accept them the more readily since we have them not here you know they are buried in the garden of the little house
