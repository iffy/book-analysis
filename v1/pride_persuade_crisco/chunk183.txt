was feeling though not saying that after being long in the country nothing could be so good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness anne did not share these feelings she persisted in a very determined though very silent disinclination for bath caught the first dim view of the extensive buildings smoking in rain without any wish of seeing them better felt their progress through the streets to be however disagreeable yet too rapid for who would be glad to see her when she arrived and looked back with fond regret to the bustles of uppercross and the seclusion of kellynch elizabeth's last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest mr elliot was in bath he had called in camden place had called a second time a third had been pointedly attentive if elizabeth and her father did not deceive themselves had been taking much pains to seek the acquaintance and proclaim the value of the connection as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect this was very wonderful if it were true and lady russell was in a state of very agreeable curiosity and perplexity about mr elliot already recanting the sentiment she had so lately expressed to mary of his being a man whom she had no wish to see she had a great wish to see him if he really sought to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch he must be forgiven for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance but she felt that she would rather see mr elliot again than not which was more than she could say for many other persons in bath she was put down in camden place and lady russell then drove to her own lodgings in rivers street chapter sir walter had taken a very good house in camden place a lofty dignified situation such as becomes a man of consequence and both he and elizabeth were settled there much to their satisfaction anne entered it with a sinking heart anticipating an imprisonment of many months and anxiously saying to herself oh when shall i leave you again a degree of unexpected cordiality however in the welcome she received did her good her father and sister were glad to see her for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture and met her with kindness her making a fourth when they sat down to dinner was noticed as an advantage mrs clay was very pleasant and very smiling but her courtesies and smiles were more a matter of course anne had always felt that she would pretend what was proper on her arrival but the complaisance of the others was unlooked for they were evidently in excellent spirits and she was soon to listen to the causes they had no inclination to listen to her after laying out for some compliments of being deeply regretted in their old neighbourhood which anne could not pay they had only a few faint enquiries to make before the talk must be all their own uppercross excited no interest kellynch very little it was all bath they had the pleasure of assuring her that bath more than answered their expectations in every respect their house was undoubtedly the best in camden place their drawing-rooms had many decided advantages over all the others which they had either seen or heard of and the superiority was not less in the style of the fitting-up or the taste of the furniture their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after everybody was wanting to visit them they had drawn back from many introductions and still were perpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing here were funds of enjoyment could anne wonder that her father and sister were happy she might not wonder but she must sigh that her father should feel no degradation in his change should see nothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder should find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town and she must sigh and smile and wonder too as elizabeth threw open the folding-doors and walked with exultation from one drawing-room to the other boasting of their space at the possibility of that woman who had been mistress of kellynch hall finding extent to be proud of between two walls perhaps thirty feet asunder but this was not all which they had to make them happy they had mr elliot too anne had a great deal to hear of mr elliot he was not only pardoned they were delighted with him he had been in bath about a fortnight he had passed through bath in november in his way to london when the intelligence of sir walter's being settled there had of course reached him though only twenty-four hours in the place but he had not been able to avail himself of it but he had now been a fortnight in bath and his first object on arriving had been to leave his card in camden place following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet and when they did meet by such great openness of conduct such readiness to apologize for the past such solicitude to be received as a relation again that their former good understanding was completely re-established they had not a fault to
