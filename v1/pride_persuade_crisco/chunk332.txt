saying i should throw myself into the sea at once for i could not bear it poor father murmured the priest from day to day he lived on alone and more and more solitary m morrel and mercds came to see him but his door was closed and although i was certain he was at home he would not make any answer one day when contrary to his custom he had admitted mercds and the poor girl in spite of her own grief and despair endeavored to console him he said to her be assured my dear daughter he is dead and instead of expecting him it is he who is awaiting us i am quite happy for i am the oldest and of course shall see him first however well disposed a person may be why you see we leave off after a time seeing persons who are in sorrow they make one melancholy and so at last old dants was left all to himself and i only saw from time to time strangers go up to him and come down again with some bundle they tried to hide but i guessed what these bundles were and that he sold by degrees what he had to pay for his subsistence at length the poor old fellow reached the end of all he had he owed three quarters rent and they threatened to turn him out he begged for another week which was granted to him i know this because the landlord came into my apartment when he left his for the first three days i heard him walking about as usual but on the fourth i heard nothing i then resolved to go up to him at all risks the door was closed but i looked through the keyhole and saw him so pale and haggard that believing him very ill i went and told m morrel and then ran on to mercds they both came immediately m morrel bringing a doctor and the doctor said it was inflammation of the bowels and ordered him a limited diet i was there too and i never shall forget the old mans smile at this prescription from that time he received all who came he had an excuse for not eating any more the doctor had put him on a diet the abb uttered a kind of groan the story interests you does it not sir inquired caderousse yes replied the abb it is very affecting mercds came again and she found him so altered that she was even more anxious than before to have him taken to her own home this was m morrels wish also who would fain have conveyed the old man against his consent but the old man resisted and cried so that they were actually frightened mercds remained therefore by his bedside and m morrel went away making a sign to the catalan that he had left his purse on the chimney-piece but availing himself of the doctors order the old man would not take any sustenance at length after nine days of despair and fasting the old man died cursing those who had caused his misery and saying to mercds if you ever see my edmond again tell him i die blessing him the abb rose from his chair made two turns round the chamber and pressed his trembling hand against his parched throat and you believe he died of hunger sir of hunger said caderousse i am as certain of it as that we two are christians the abb with a shaking hand seized a glass of water that was standing by him half-full swallowed it at one gulp and then resumed his seat with red eyes and pale cheeks this was indeed a horrid event said he in a hoarse voice the more so sir as it was mens and not gods doing tell me of those men said the abb and remember too he added in an almost menacing tone you have promised to tell me everything tell me therefore who are these men who killed the son with despair and the father with famine two men jealous of him sir one from love and the other from ambition fernand and danglars how was this jealousy manifested speak on they denounced edmond as a bonapartist agent which of the two denounced him which was the real delinquent both sir one with a letter and the other put it in the post and where was this letter written at la rserve the day before the betrothal feast twas so then twas so then murmured the abb oh faria faria how well did you judge men and things what did you please to say sir asked caderousse nothing nothing replied the priest go on it was danglars who wrote the denunciation with his left hand that his writing might not be recognized and fernand who put it in the post but exclaimed the abb suddenly you were there yourself i said caderousse astonished who told you i was there the abb saw he had overshot the mark and he added quickly no one but in order to have known everything so well you must have been an eye-witness true true said caderousse in a choking voice i was there and did you not remonstrate against such infamy asked the abb if not you were an accomplice
