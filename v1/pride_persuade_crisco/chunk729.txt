captain there said the sentinel pointing over his shoulder to a spacious crypt hollowed out of the rock the lights from which shone into the passage through the large arched openings fine spoil captain fine spoil said peppino in italian and taking danglars by the collar of his coat he dragged him to an opening resembling a door through which they entered the apartment which the captain appeared to have made his dwelling-place is this the man asked the captain who was attentively reading plutarchs life of alexander himself captain himself very well show him to me at this rather impertinent order peppino raised his torch to the face of danglars who hastily withdrew that he might not have his eyelashes burnt his agitated features presented the appearance of pale and hideous terror the man is tired said the captain conduct him to his bed oh murmured danglars that bed is probably one of the coffins hollowed in the wall and the sleep i shall enjoy will be death from one of the poniards i see glistening in the darkness from their beds of dried leaves or wolf-skins at the back of the chamber now arose the companions of the man who had been found by albert de morcerf reading csars commentaries and by danglars studying the life of alexander the banker uttered a groan and followed his guide he neither supplicated nor exclaimed he no longer possessed strength will power or feeling he followed where they led him at length he found himself at the foot of a staircase and he mechanically lifted his foot five or six times then a low door was opened before him and bending his head to avoid striking his forehead he entered a small room cut out of the rock the cell was clean though empty and dry though situated at an immeasurable distance under the earth a bed of dried grass covered with goat-skins was placed in one corner danglars brightened up on beholding it fancying that it gave some promise of safety oh god be praised he said it is a real bed this was the second time within the hour that he had invoked the name of god he had not done so for ten years before ecco said the guide and pushing danglars into the cell he closed the door upon him a bolt grated and danglars was a prisoner if there had been no bolt it would have been impossible for him to pass through the midst of the garrison who held the catacombs of st sebastian encamped round a master whom our readers must have recognized as the famous luigi vampa danglars too had recognized the bandit whose existence he would not believe when albert de morcerf mentioned him in paris and not only did he recognize him but the cell in which albert had been confined and which was probably kept for the accommodation of strangers these recollections were dwelt upon with some pleasure by danglars and restored him to some degree of tranquillity since the bandits had not despatched him at once he felt that they would not kill him at all they had arrested him for the purpose of robbery and as he had only a few louis about him he doubted not he would be ransomed he remembered that morcerf had been taxed at crowns and as he considered himself of much greater importance than morcerf he fixed his own price at crowns eight thousand crowns amounted to livres he would then have about francs left with this sum he could manage to keep out of difficulties therefore tolerably secure in being able to extricate himself from his position provided he were not rated at the unreasonable sum of francs he stretched himself on his bed and after turning over two or three times fell asleep with the tranquillity of the hero whose life luigi vampa was studying chapter luigi vampas bill of fare we awake from every sleep except the one dreaded by danglars he awoke to a parisian accustomed to silken curtains walls hung with velvet drapery and the soft perfume of burning wood the white smoke of which diffuses itself in graceful curves around the room the appearance of the whitewashed cell which greeted his eyes on awakening seemed like the continuation of some disagreeable dream but in such a situation a single moment suffices to change the strongest doubt into certainty yes yes he murmured i am in the hands of the brigands of whom albert de morcerf spoke his first idea was to breathe that he might know whether he was wounded he borrowed this from don quixote the only book he had ever read but which he still slightly remembered no he cried they have not wounded but perhaps they have robbed me and he thrust his hands into his pockets they were untouched the hundred louis he had reserved for his journey from rome to venice were in his trousers pocket and in that of his greatcoat he found the little note-case containing his letter of credit for francs singular bandits he exclaimed they have left me my purse and pocket-book as i was saying last night they intend me to be ransomed hello here is my watch let me see what time it is danglars watch one of breguets repeaters which he had carefully wound up on
