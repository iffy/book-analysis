the neighbourhood and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess after pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to read but alas the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousins affairs and whose character she had no reason to question at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousins corroboration she perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening at mr phillipss many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and wondered it had escaped her before she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr darcy that mr darcy might leave the country but that he should stand his ground yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week she remembered also that till the netherfield family had quitted the country he had told his story to no one but herself but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed that he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking mr darcys character though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son how differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes but his eagerness to grasp at anything his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter and in farther justification of mr darcy she could not but allow that mr bingley when questioned by jane had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair that proud and repulsive as were his manners she had never in the whole course of their acquaintance an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling that had his actions been what mr wickham represented them so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as mr bingley was incomprehensible she grew absolutely ashamed of herself of neither darcy nor wickham could she think without feeling she had been blind partial prejudiced absurd how despicably i have acted she cried i who have prided myself on my discernment i who have valued myself on my abilities who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust how humiliating is this discovery yet how just a humiliation had i been in love i could not have been more wretchedly blind but vanity not love has been my folly pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were concerned till this moment i never knew myself from herself to jane from jane to bingley her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr darcys explanation there had appeared very insufficient and she read it again widely different was the effect of a second perusal how could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged to give in the other he declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sisters attachment and she could not help remembering what charlottes opinion had always been neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane she felt that janes feelings though fervent were little displayed and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying yet merited reproach her sense of shame was severe the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having
