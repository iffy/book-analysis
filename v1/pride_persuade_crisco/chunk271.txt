everything depends on you explain yourself pray monsieur said morrel recovering his assurance as he proceeded do you recollect that a few days before the landing of his majesty the emperor i came to intercede for a young man the mate of my ship who was accused of being concerned in correspondence with the island of elba what was the other day a crime is today a title to favor you then served louis xviii and you did not show any favor it was your duty today you serve napoleon and you ought to protect him it is equally your duty i come therefore to ask what has become of him m villefort by a strong effort sought to control himself what is his name said he tell me his name edmond dants villefort would probably have rather stood opposite the muzzle of a pistol at five-and-twenty paces than have heard this name spoken but he did not blanch dants repeated he edmond dants yes monsieur villefort opened a large register then went to a table from the table turned to his registers and then turning to morrel are you quite sure you are not mistaken monsieur said he in the most natural tone in the world had morrel been a more quick-sighted man or better versed in these matters he would have been surprised at the kings procureur answering him on such a subject instead of referring him to the governors of the prison or the prefect of the department but morrel disappointed in his expectations of exciting fear was conscious only of the others condescension villefort had calculated rightly no said morrel i am not mistaken i have known him for ten years the last four of which he was in my service do not you recollect i came about six weeks ago to plead for clemency as i come today to plead for justice you received me very coldly oh the royalists were very severe with the bonapartists in those days monsieur returned villefort i was then a royalist because i believed the bourbons not only the heirs to the throne but the chosen of the nation the miraculous return of napoleon has conquered me the legitimate monarch is he who is loved by his people thats right cried morrel i like to hear you speak thus and i augur well for edmond from it wait a moment said villefort turning over the leaves of a register i have it a sailor who was about to marry a young catalan girl i recollect now it was a very serious charge how so you know that when he left here he was taken to the palais de justice well i made my report to the authorities at paris and a week after he was carried off carried off said morrel what can they have done with him oh he has been taken to fenestrelles to pignerol or to the sainte-margurite islands some fine morning he will return to take command of your vessel come when he will it shall be kept for him but how is it he is not already returned it seems to me the first care of government should be to set at liberty those who have suffered for their adherence to it do not be too hasty m morrel replied villefort the order of imprisonment came from high authority and the order for his liberation must proceed from the same source and as napoleon has scarcely been reinstated a fortnight the letters have not yet been forwarded but said morrel is there no way of expediting all these formalities of releasing him from arrest there has been no arrest how it is sometimes essential to government to cause a mans disappearance without leaving any traces so that no written forms or documents may defeat their wishes it might be so under the bourbons but at present it has always been so my dear morrel since the reign of louis xiv the emperor is more strict in prison discipline than even louis himself and the number of prisoners whose names are not on the register is incalculable had morrel even any suspicions so much kindness would have dispelled them well m de villefort how would you advise me to act asked he petition the minister oh i know what that is the minister receives two hundred petitions every day and does not read three that is true but he will read a petition countersigned and presented by me and will you undertake to deliver it with the greatest pleasure dants was then guilty and now he is innocent and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn him villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry which however improbable it might be if it did take place would leave him defenceless but how shall i address the minister sit down there said villefort giving up his place to morrel and write what i dictate will you be so good certainly but lose no time we have lost too much already that is true only think what the poor fellow may even now be suffering villefort shuddered at the suggestion but he had gone too far to draw back dants must be crushed to gratify villeforts ambition villefort dictated a petition in which from an excellent intention no doubt dants patriotic services
