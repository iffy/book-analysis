be satisfied ah my dear count you are far too indulgent and you are far too exacting supposing for instance and do not be angry at what i am going to say well supposing the assertion to be really true a son ought not to submit to such a stain on his fathers honor ma foi we live in times when there is much to which we must submit that is precisely the fault of the age and do you undertake to reform it yes as far as i am personally concerned well you are indeed exacting my dear fellow yes i own it are you quite impervious to good advice not when it comes from a friend and do you account me that title certainly i do well then before going to beauchamp with your witnesses seek further information on the subject from whom from hayde why what can be the use of mixing a woman up in the affair what can she do in it she can declare to you for example that your father had no hand whatever in the defeat and death of the vizier or if by chance he had indeed the misfortune to i have told you my dear count that i would not for one moment admit of such a proposition you reject this means of information then i do most decidedly then let me offer one more word of advice do so then but let it be the last you do not wish to hear it perhaps on the contrary i request it do not take any witnesses with you when you go to beauchamp visit him alone that would be contrary to all custom your case is not an ordinary one and what is your reason for advising me to go alone because then the affair will rest between you and beauchamp explain yourself i will do so if beauchamp be disposed to retract you ought at least to give him the opportunity of doing it of his own free will the satisfaction to you will be the same if on the contrary he refuses to do so it will then be quite time enough to admit two strangers into your secret they will not be strangers they will be friends ah but the friends of today are the enemies of tomorrow beauchamp for instance so you recommend i recommend you to be prudent then you advise me to go alone to beauchamp i do and i will tell you why when you wish to obtain some concession from a mans self-love you must avoid even the appearance of wishing to wound it i believe you are right i am glad of it then i will go alone go but you would do better still by not going at all that is impossible do so then it will be a wiser plan than the first which you proposed but if in spite of all my precautions i am at last obliged to fight will you not be my second my dear viscount said monte cristo gravely you must have seen before today that at all times and in all places i have been at your disposal but the service which you have just demanded of me is one which it is out of my power to render you why perhaps you may know at some future period and in the mean time i request you to excuse my declining to put you in possession of my reasons well i will have franz and chteau-renaud they will be the very men for it do so then but if i do fight you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or two in shooting and fencing that too is impossible what a singular being you are you will not interfere in anything you are right that is the principle on which i wish to act we will say no more about it then good-bye count morcerf took his hat and left the room he found his carriage at the door and doing his utmost to restrain his anger he went at once to find beauchamp who was in his office it was a gloomy dusty-looking apartment such as journalists offices have always been from time immemorial the servant announced m albert de morcerf beauchamp repeated the name to himself as though he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright and then gave orders for him to be admitted albert entered beauchamp uttered an exclamation of surprise on seeing his friend leap over and trample under foot all the newspapers which were strewed about the room this way this way my dear albert said he holding out his hand to the young man are you out of your senses or do you come peaceably to take breakfast with me try and find a seat there is one by that geranium which is the only thing in the room to remind me that there are other leaves in the world besides leaves of paper beauchamp said albert it is of your journal that i come to speak indeed what do you wish to say about it i desire that a statement contained in it should be rectified to what do you refer but pray sit down thank you said albert with a cold and formal bow will you now have the kindness to explain
