at her niece desirous of knowing how she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head presuming however that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends elizabeth construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little eager to be alone and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress but she had no reason to fear mr and mrs gardiners curiosity it was not their wish to force her communication it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any idea of it was evident that he was very much in love with her they saw much to interest but nothing to justify enquiry of mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find they could not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servants report without any reference to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for mr darcy there was now an interest however in believing the housekeeper and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and whose own manners indicated respectability was not to be hastily rejected neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight they had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town where the family did not visit it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a well-known fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind him which mr darcy afterwards discharged as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out she certainly did not hate him no hatred had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light which yesterday had produced but above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked it was gratitude gratitude not merely for having once loved her but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection he who she had been persuaded would avoid her as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any indelicate display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where their two selves only were concerned was
