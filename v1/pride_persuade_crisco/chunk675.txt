had she been in her usual state of health indeed her brain was only the seat of vague ideas and confused forms mingled with strange fancies alone presented themselves before her eyes during the daytime valentines perceptions remained tolerably clear owing to the constant presence of m noirtier who caused himself to be carried to his granddaughters room and watched her with his paternal tenderness villefort also on his return from the law courts frequently passed an hour or two with his father and child at six oclock villefort retired to his study at eight m davrigny himself arrived bringing the night draught prepared for the young girl and then m noirtier was carried away a nurse of the doctors choice succeeded them and never left till about ten or eleven oclock when valentine was asleep as she went downstairs she gave the keys of valentines room to m de villefort so that no one could reach the sick-room excepting through that of madame de villefort and little edward every morning morrel called on noirtier to receive news of valentine and extraordinary as it seemed each day found him less uneasy certainly though valentine still labored under dreadful nervous excitement she was better and moreover monte cristo had told him when half distracted he had rushed to the counts house that if she were not dead in two hours she would be saved now four days had elapsed and valentine still lived the nervous excitement of which we speak pursued valentine even in her sleep or rather in that state of somnolence which succeeded her waking hours it was then in the silence of night in the dim light shed from the alabaster lamp on the chimney-piece that she saw the shadows pass and repass which hover over the bed of sickness and fan the fever with their trembling wings first she fancied she saw her stepmother threatening her then morrel stretched his arms towards her sometimes mere strangers like the count of monte cristo came to visit her even the very furniture in these moments of delirium seemed to move and this state lasted till about three oclock in the morning when a deep heavy slumber overcame the young girl from which she did not awake till daylight on the evening of the day on which valentine had learned of the flight of eugnie and the arrest of benedetto villefort having retired as well as noirtier and davrigny her thoughts wandered in a confused maze alternately reviewing her own situation and the events she had just heard eleven oclock had struck the nurse having placed the beverage prepared by the doctor within reach of the patient and locked the door was listening with terror to the comments of the servants in the kitchen and storing her memory with all the horrible stories which had for some months past amused the occupants of the antechambers in the house of the kings attorney meanwhile an unexpected scene was passing in the room which had been so carefully locked ten minutes had elapsed since the nurse had left valentine who for the last hour had been suffering from the fever which returned nightly incapable of controlling her ideas was forced to yield to the excitement which exhausted itself in producing and reproducing a succession and recurrence of the same fancies and images the night-lamp threw out countless rays each resolving itself into some strange form to her disordered imagination when suddenly by its flickering light valentine thought she saw the door of her library which was in the recess by the chimney-piece open slowly though she in vain listened for the sound of the hinges on which it turned at any other time valentine would have seized the silken bell-pull and summoned assistance but nothing astonished her in her present situation her reason told her that all the visions she beheld were but the children of her imagination and the conviction was strengthened by the fact that in the morning no traces remained of the nocturnal phantoms who disappeared with the coming of daylight from behind the door a human figure appeared but the girl was too familiar with such apparitions to be alarmed and therefore only stared hoping to recognize morrel the figure advanced towards the bed and appeared to listen with profound attention at this moment a ray of light glanced across the face of the midnight visitor it is not he she murmured and waited in the assurance that this was but a dream for the man to disappear or assume some other form still she felt her pulse and finding it throb violently she remembered that the best method of dispelling such illusions was to drink for a draught of the beverage prepared by the doctor to allay her fever seemed to cause a reaction of the brain and for a short time she suffered less valentine therefore reached her hand towards the glass but as soon as her trembling arm left the bed the apparition advanced more quickly towards her and approached the young girl so closely that she fancied she heard his breath and felt the pressure of his hand this time the illusion or rather the reality surpassed anything valentine had before experienced she began to believe herself really alive and awake and the belief that her reason was this time not deceived made her shudder the
