as usual the oldest women were the most decorated and the ugliest the most conspicuous if there was a beautiful lily or a sweet rose you had to search for it concealed in some corner behind a mother with a turban or an aunt with a bird-of-paradise at each moment in the midst of the crowd the buzzing and the laughter the door-keepers voice was heard announcing some name well known in the financial department respected in the army or illustrious in the literary world and which was acknowledged by a slight movement in the different groups but for one whose privilege it was to agitate that ocean of human waves how many were received with a look of indifference or a sneer of disdain at the moment when the hand of the massive time-piece representing endymion asleep pointed to nine on its golden face and the hammer the faithful type of mechanical thought struck nine times the name of the count of monte cristo resounded in its turn and as if by an electric shock all the assembly turned towards

the arrival of monte cristo and now came forward to pay his respects to the count he found him completely surrounded all were eager to speak to him as is always the case with those whose words are few
