more unobjectionable tenant in all essentials than admiral croft bid fair to be could hardly offer so far went his understanding and his vanity supplied a little additional soothing in the admiral's situation in life which was just high enough and not too high i have let my house to admiral croft would sound extremely well very much better than to any mere mr a mr save perhaps some half dozen in the nation always needs a note of explanation an admiral speaks his own consequence and at the same time can never make a baronet look small in all their dealings and intercourse sir walter elliot must ever have the precedence nothing could be done without a reference to elizabeth but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her mr shepherd was completely empowered to act and no sooner had such an end been reached than anne who had been a most attentive listener to the whole left the room to seek the comfort of cool air for her flushed cheeks and as she walked along a favourite grove said with a gentle sigh a few months more and he perhaps may be walking here chapter he was not mr wentworth the former curate of monkford however suspicious appearances may be but a captain frederick wentworth his brother who being made commander in consequence of the action off st domingo and not immediately employed had come into somersetshire in the summer of and having no parent living found a home for half a year at monkford he was at that time a remarkably fine young man with a great deal of intelligence spirit and brilliancy and anne an extremely pretty girl with gentleness modesty taste and feeling half the sum of attraction on either side might have been enough for he had nothing to do and she had hardly anybody to love but the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail they were gradually acquainted and when acquainted rapidly and deeply in love it would be difficult to say which had seen highest perfection in the other or which had been the happiest she in receiving his declarations and proposals or he in having them accepted a short period of exquisite felicity followed and but a short one troubles soon arose sir walter on being applied to without actually withholding his consent or saying it should never be gave it all the negative of great astonishment great coldness great silence and a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter he thought it a very degrading alliance and lady russell though with more tempered and pardonable pride received it as a most unfortunate one anne elliot with all her claims of birth beauty and mind to throw herself away at nineteen involve herself at nineteen in an engagement with a young man who had nothing but himself to recommend him and no hopes of attaining affluence but in the chances of a most uncertain profession and no connexions to secure even his farther rise in the profession would be indeed a throwing away which she grieved to think of anne elliot so young known to so few to be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune or rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing anxious youth-killing dependence it must not be if by any fair interference of friendship any representations from one who had almost a mother's love and mother's rights it would be prevented captain wentworth had no fortune he had been lucky in his profession but spending freely what had come freely had realized nothing but he was confident that he should soon be rich full of life and ardour he knew that he should soon have a ship and soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted he had always been lucky he knew he should be so still such confidence powerful in its own warmth and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it must have been enough for anne but lady russell saw it very differently his sanguine temper and fearlessness of mind operated very differently on her she saw in it but an aggravation of the evil it only added a dangerous character to himself he was brilliant he was headstrong lady russell had little taste for wit and of anything approaching to imprudence a horror she deprecated the connexion in every light such opposition as these feelings produced was more than anne could combat young and gentle as she was it might yet have been possible to withstand her father's ill-will though unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister but lady russell whom she had always loved and relied on could not with such steadiness of opinion and such tenderness of manner be continually advising her in vain she was persuaded to believe the engagement a wrong thing indiscreet improper hardly capable of success and not deserving it but it was not a merely selfish caution under which she acted in putting an end to it had she not imagined herself consulting his good even more than her own she could hardly have given him up the belief of being prudent
