inquiries here sire interposed the minister of police i came a moment ago to give your majesty fresh information which i had obtained on this head when your majestys attention was attracted by the terrible event that has occurred in the gulf and now these facts will cease to interest your majesty on the contrary sir on the contrary said louis xviii this affair seems to me to have a decided connection with that which occupies our attention and the death of general quesnel will perhaps put us on the direct track of a great internal conspiracy at the name of general quesnel villefort trembled everything points to the conclusion sire said the minister of police that death was not the result of suicide as we first believed but of assassination general quesnel it appears had just left a bonapartist club when he disappeared an unknown person had been with him that morning and made an appointment with him in the rue saint-jacques unfortunately the generals valet who was dressing his hair at the moment when the stranger entered heard the street mentioned but did not catch the number as the police minister related this to the king villefort who looked as if his very life hung on the speakers lips turned alternately red and pale the king looked towards him do you not think with me m de villefort that general quesnel whom they believed attached to the usurper but who was really entirely devoted to me has perished the victim of a bonapartist ambush it is probable sire replied villefort but is this all that is known they are on the track of the man who appointed the meeting with him on his track said villefort yes the servant has given his description he is a man of from fifty to fifty-two years of age dark with black eyes covered with shaggy eyebrows and a thick moustache he was dressed in a blue frock-coat buttoned up to the chin and wore at his button-hole the rosette of an officer of the legion of honor yesterday a person exactly corresponding with this description was followed but he was lost sight of at the corner of the rue de la jussienne and the rue coq-hron villefort leaned on the back of an armchair for as the minister of police went on speaking he felt his legs bend under him but when he learned that the unknown had escaped the vigilance of the agent who followed him he breathed again continue to seek for this man sir said the king to the minister of police for if as i am all but convinced general quesnel who would have been so useful to us at this moment has been murdered his assassins bonapartists or not shall be cruelly punished it required all villeforts coolness not to betray the terror with which this declaration of the king inspired him how strange continued the king with some asperity the police think that they have disposed of the whole matter when they say a murder has been committed and especially so when they can add and we are on the track of the guilty persons sire your majesty will i trust be amply satisfied on this point at least we shall see i will no longer detain you m de villefort for you must be fatigued after so long a journey go and rest of course you stopped at your fathers a feeling of faintness came over villefort m no sire he replied i alighted at the hotel de madrid in the rue de tournon but you have seen him sire i went straight to the duc de blacas but you will see him then i think not sire ah i forgot said louis smiling in a manner which proved that all these questions were not made without a motive i forgot you and m noirtier are not on the best terms possible and that is another sacrifice made to the royal cause and for which you should be recompensed sire the kindness your majesty deigns to evince towards me is a recompense which so far surpasses my utmost ambition that i have nothing more to ask for never mind sir we will not forget you make your mind easy in the meanwhile the king here detached the cross of the legion of honor which he usually wore over his blue coat near the cross of st louis above the order of notre-dame-du-mont-carmel and st lazare and gave it to villefort in the meanwhile take this cross sire said villefort your majesty mistakes this is an officers cross ma foi said louis xviii take it such as it is for i have not the time to procure you another blacas let it be your care to see that the brevet is made out and sent to m de villefort villeforts eyes were filled with tears of joy and pride he took the cross and kissed it and now he said may i inquire what are the orders with which your majesty deigns to honor me take what rest you require and remember that if you are not able to serve me here in paris you may be of the greatest service to me at marseilles sire replied villefort bowing in an hour i shall have quitted paris go sir said the king and should i forget you
