what amuses me said monte cristo i am like nero cupitor impossibilium and that is what is amusing you at this moment this fish which seems so exquisite to you is very likely no better than perch or salmon but it seemed impossible to procure it and here it is but how could you have these fish brought to france oh nothing more easy each fish was brought over in a cask one filled with river herbs and weeds the other with rushes and lake plants they were placed in a wagon built on purpose and thus the sterlet lived twelve days the lamprey eight and both were alive when my cook seized them killing one with milk and the other with wine you do not believe me m danglars i cannot help doubting answered danglars with his stupid smile baptistin said the count have the other fish brought in the sterlet and the lamprey which came in the other casks and which are yet alive danglars opened his bewildered eyes the company clapped their hands four servants carried in two casks covered with aquatic plants and in each of which was breathing a fish similar to those on the table but why have two of each sort asked danglars merely because one might have died carelessly answered monte cristo you are certainly an extraordinary man said danglars and philosophers may well say it is a fine thing to be rich and to have ideas added madame danglars oh do not give me credit for this madame it was done by the romans who much esteemed them and pliny relates that they sent slaves from ostia to rome who carried on their heads fish which he calls the mulus and which from the description must probably be the goldfish it was also considered a luxury to have them alive it being an amusing sight to see them die for when dying they change color three or four times and like the rainbow when it disappears pass through all the prismatic shades after which they were sent to the kitchen their agony formed part of their merit if they were not seen alive they were despised when dead yes said debray but then ostia is only a few leagues from rome true said monte cristo but what would be the use of living eighteen hundred years after lucullus if we can do no better than he could the two cavalcanti opened their enormous eyes but had the good sense not to say anything all this is very extraordinary said chteau-renaud still what i admire the most i confess is the marvellous promptitude with which your orders are executed is it not true that you only bought this house five or six days ago certainly not longer well i am sure it is quite transformed since last week if i remember rightly it had another entrance and the courtyard was paved and empty while today we have a splendid lawn bordered by trees which appear to be a hundred years old why not i am fond of grass and shade said monte cristo yes said madame de villefort the door was towards the road before and on the day of my miraculous escape you brought me into the house from the road i remember yes madame said monte cristo but i preferred having an entrance which would allow me to see the bois de boulogne over my gate in four days said morrel it is extraordinary indeed said chteau-renaud it seems quite miraculous to make a new house out of an old one for it was very old and dull too i recollect coming for my mother to look at it when m de saint-mran advertised it for sale two or three years ago m de saint-mran said madame de villefort then this house belonged to m de saint-mran before you bought it it appears so replied monte cristo is it possible that you do not know of whom you purchased it quite so my steward transacts all this business for me it is certainly ten years since the house had been occupied said chteau-renaud and it was quite melancholy to look at it with the blinds closed the doors locked and the weeds in the court really if the house had not belonged to the father-in-law of the procureur one might have thought it some accursed place where a horrible crime had been committed villefort who had hitherto not tasted the three or four glasses of rare wine which were placed before him here took one and drank it off monte cristo allowed a short time to elapse and then said it is singular baron but the same idea came across me the first time i came here it looked so gloomy i should never have bought it if my steward had not taken the matter into his own hands perhaps the fellow had been bribed by the notary it is probable stammered out villefort trying to smile but i can assure you that i had nothing to do with any such proceeding this house is part of valentines marriage-portion and m de saint-mran wished to sell it for if it had remained another year or two uninhabited it would have fallen to ruin it was morrels turn to become pale there was above all one room continued monte cristo very plain in
