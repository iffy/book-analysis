shielded by their birth but nowadays they are not inviolable it has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer the victims of their persecutions to reappear as the inquisition rarely allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and their flesh lacerated by torture so madness is always concealed in its cell from whence should it depart it is conveyed to some gloomy hospital where the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the mutilated being the jailer delivers to him the very madness of the abb faria gone mad in prison condemned him to perpetual captivity the inspector kept his word with dants he examined the register and found the following note concerning him edmond dants violent bonapartist took an active part in the return from elba the greatest watchfulness and care to be exercised this note was in a different hand from the rest which showed that it had been added since his confinement the inspector could not contend against this accusation he simply wrote nothing to be done this visit had infused new vigor into dants he had till then forgotten the date but now with a fragment of plaster he wrote the date th july and made a mark every day in order not to lose his reckoning again days and weeks passed away then months dants still waited he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight this fortnight expired he decided that the inspector would do nothing until his return to paris and that he would not reach there until his circuit was finished he therefore fixed three months three months passed away then six more finally ten months and a half had gone by and no favorable change had taken place and dants began to fancy the inspectors visit but a dream an illusion of the brain at the expiration of a year the governor was transferred he had obtained charge of the fortress at ham he took with him several of his subordinates and amongst them dants jailer a new governor arrived it would have been too tedious to acquire the names of the prisoners he learned their numbers instead this horrible place contained fifty cells their inhabitants were designated by the numbers of their cell and the unhappy young man was no longer called edmond dants he was now number chapter number and number dants passed through all the stages of torture natural to prisoners in suspense he was sustained at first by that pride of conscious innocence which is the sequence to hope then he began to doubt his own innocence which justified in some measure the governors belief in his mental alienation and then relaxing his sentiment of pride he addressed his supplications not to god but to man god is always the last resource unfortunates who ought to begin with god do not have any hope in him till they have exhausted all other means of deliverance dants asked to be removed from his present dungeon into another even if it were darker and deeper for a change however disadvantageous was still a change and would afford him some amusement he entreated to be allowed to walk about to have fresh air books and writing materials his requests were not granted but he went on asking all the same he accustomed himself to speaking to the new jailer although the latter was if possible more taciturn than the old one but still to speak to a man even though mute was something dants spoke for the sake of hearing his own voice he had tried to speak when alone but the sound of his voice terrified him often before his captivity dants mind had revolted at the idea of assemblages of prisoners made up of thieves vagabonds and murderers he now wished to be amongst them in order to see some other face besides that of his jailer he sighed for the galleys with the infamous costume the chain and the brand on the shoulder the galley-slaves breathed the fresh air of heaven and saw each other they were very happy he besought the jailer one day to let him have a companion were it even the mad abb the jailer though rough and hardened by the constant sight of so much suffering was yet a man at the bottom of his heart he had often had a feeling of pity for this unhappy young man who suffered so and he laid the request of number before the governor but the latter sapiently imagined that dants wished to conspire or attempt an escape and refused his request dants had exhausted all human resources and he then turned to god all the pious ideas that had been so long forgotten returned he recollected the prayers his mother had taught him and discovered a new meaning in every word for in prosperity prayers seem but a mere medley of words until misfortune comes and the unhappy sufferer first understands the meaning of the sublime language in which he invokes the pity of heaven he prayed and prayed aloud no longer terrified at the sound of his own voice for he fell into a sort of ecstasy he laid every action of his life before the almighty proposed tasks to accomplish and at the end of every prayer introduced the entreaty oftener addressed to man
