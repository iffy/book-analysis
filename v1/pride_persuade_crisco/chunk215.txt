be much better that will be a novelty and a treat they have not seen two such drawing rooms before they will be delighted to come to-morrow evening it shall be a regular party small but most elegant and this satisfied elizabeth and when the invitation was given to the two present and promised for the absent mary was as completely satisfied she was particularly asked to meet mr elliot and be introduced to lady dalrymple and miss carteret who were fortunately already engaged to come and she could not have received a more gratifying attention miss elliot was to have the honour of calling on mrs musgrove in the course of the morning and anne walked off with charles and mary to go and see her and henrietta directly her plan of sitting with lady russell must give way for the present they all three called in rivers street for a couple of minutes but anne convinced herself that a day's delay of the intended communication could be of no consequence and hastened forward to the white hart to see again the friends and companions of the last autumn with an eagerness of good-will which many associations contributed to form they found mrs musgrove and her daughter within and by themselves and anne had the kindest welcome from each henrietta was exactly in that state of recently-improved views of fresh-formed happiness which made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had ever liked before at all and mrs musgrove's real affection had been won by her usefulness when they were in distress it was a heartiness and a warmth and a sincerity which anne delighted in the more from the sad want of such blessings at home she was entreated to give them as much of her time as possible invited for every day and all day long or rather claimed as part of the family and in return she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance and on charles's leaving them together was listening to mrs musgrove's history of louisa and to henrietta's of herself giving opinions on business and recommendations to shops with intervals of every help which mary required from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts from finding her keys and assorting her trinkets to trying to convince her that she was not ill-used by anybody which mary well amused as she generally was in her station at a window overlooking the entrance to the pump room could not but have her moments of imagining a morning of thorough confusion was to be expected a large party in an hotel ensured a quick-changing unsettled scene one five minutes brought a note the next a parcel and anne had not been there half an hour when their dining-room spacious as it was seemed more than half filled a party of steady old friends were seated around mrs musgrove and charles came back with captains harville and wentworth the appearance of the latter could not be more than the surprise of the moment it was impossible for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together again their last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings she had derived from it a delightful conviction but she feared from his looks that the same unfortunate persuasion which had hastened him away from the concert room still governed he did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation she tried to be calm and leave things to take their course and tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence--surely if there be constant attachment on each side our hearts must understand each other ere long we are not boy and girl to be captiously irritable misled by every moment's inadvertence and wantonly playing with our own happiness and yet a few minutes afterwards she felt as if their being in company with each other under their present circumstances could only be exposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most mischievous kind anne cried mary still at her window there is mrs clay i am sure standing under the colonnade and a gentleman with her i saw them turn the corner from bath street just now they seemed deep in talk who is it come and tell me good heavens i recollect it is mr elliot himself no cried anne quickly it cannot be mr elliot i assure you he was to leave bath at nine this morning and does not come back till to-morrow as she spoke she felt that captain wentworth was looking at her the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her and made her regret that she had said so much simple as it was mary resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin began talking very warmly about the family features and protesting still more positively that it was mr elliot calling again upon anne to come and look for herself but anne did not mean to stir and tried to
