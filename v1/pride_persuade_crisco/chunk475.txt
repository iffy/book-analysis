then added this young madcap is however very nearly right and merely re-echoes what he has heard me say with pain a hundred times for mademoiselle de villefort is in spite of all we can do to rouse her of a melancholy disposition and taciturn habit which frequently injure the effect of her beauty but what detains her go edward and see because they are looking for her where she is not to be found and where are they looking for her with grandpapa noirtier and do you think she is not there no no no no no she is not there replied edward singing his words and where is she then if you know why dont you tell she is under the big chestnut-tree replied the spoiled brat as he gave in spite of his mothers commands live flies to the parrot which seemed keenly to relish such fare madame de villefort stretched out her hand to ring intending to direct her waiting-maid to the spot where she would find valentine when the young lady herself entered the apartment she appeared much dejected and any person who considered her attentively might have observed the traces of recent tears in her eyes valentine whom we have in the rapid march of our narrative presented to our readers without formally introducing her was a tall and graceful girl of nineteen with bright chestnut hair deep blue eyes and that reposeful air of quiet distinction which characterized her mother her white and slender fingers her pearly neck her cheeks tinted with varying hues reminded one of the lovely englishwomen who have been so poetically compared in their manner to the gracefulness of a swan she entered the apartment and seeing near her stepmother the stranger of whom she had already heard so much saluted him without any girlish awkwardness or even lowering her eyes and with an elegance that redoubled the counts attention he rose to return the salutation mademoiselle de villefort my step-daughter said madame de villefort to monte cristo leaning back on her sofa and motioning towards valentine with her hand and m de monte cristo king of china emperor of cochin-china said the young imp looking slyly towards his sister madame de villefort at this really did turn pale and was very nearly angry with this household plague who answered to the name of edward but the count on the contrary smiled and appeared to look at the boy complacently which caused the maternal heart to bound again with joy and enthusiasm but madame replied the count continuing the conversation and looking by turns at madame de villefort and valentine have i not already had the honor of meeting yourself and mademoiselle before i could not help thinking so just now the idea came over my mind and as mademoiselle entered the sight of her was an additional ray of light thrown on a confused remembrance excuse the remark i do not think it likely sir mademoiselle de villefort is not very fond of society and we very seldom go out said the young lady then it was not in society that i met with mademoiselle or yourself madame or this charming little merry boy besides the parisian world is entirely unknown to me for as i believe i told you i have been in paris but very few days no but perhaps you will permit me to call to mind stay the count placed his hand on his brow as if to collect his thoughts no it was somewhere away from here it was i do not know but it appears that this recollection is connected with a lovely sky and some religious fte mademoiselle was holding flowers in her hand the interesting boy was chasing a beautiful peacock in a garden and you madame were under the trellis of some arbor pray come to my aid madame do not these circumstances appeal to your memory no indeed replied madame de villefort and yet it appears to me sir that if i had met you anywhere the recollection of you must have been imprinted on my memory perhaps the count saw us in italy said valentine timidly yes in italy it was in italy most probably replied monte cristo you have travelled then in italy mademoiselle yes madame and i were there two years ago the doctors anxious for my lungs had prescribed the air of naples we went by bologna perugia and rome ah yes true mademoiselle exclaimed monte cristo as if this simple explanation was sufficient to revive the recollection he sought it was at perugia on corpus christi day in the garden of the htel des postes when chance brought us together you madame de villefort and her son i now remember having had the honor of meeting you i perfectly well remember perugia sir and the htel des postes and the festival of which you speak said madame de villefort but in vain do i tax my memory of whose treachery i am ashamed for i really do not recall to mind that i ever had the pleasure of seeing you before it is strange but neither do i recollect meeting with you observed valentine raising her beautiful eyes to the count m but i remember it perfectly interposed the darling edward i will assist your memory madame continued the count the day had been burning
