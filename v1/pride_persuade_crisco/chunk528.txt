m danglars absorbed in an interesting conversation with m cavalcanti he paid no attention to anything that was passing while monte cristo had begged the smelling-bottle of madame de villefort he had noticed the approach of villefort to madame danglars and he soon guessed all that had passed between them though the words had been uttered in so low a voice as hardly to be heard by madame danglars without opposing their arrangements he allowed morrel chteau-renaud and debray to leave on horseback and the ladies in m de villeforts carriage danglars more and more delighted with major cavalcanti had offered him a seat in his carriage andrea cavalcanti found his tilbury waiting at the door the groom in every respect a caricature of the english fashion was standing on tiptoe to hold a large iron-gray horse andrea had spoken very little during dinner he was an intelligent lad and he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people amongst whom with dilating eyes he saw the kings attorney then he had been seized upon by danglars who with a rapid glance at the stiff-necked old major and his modest son and taking into consideration the hospitality of the count made up his mind that he was in the society of some nabob come to paris to finish the worldly education of his heir he contemplated with unspeakable delight the large diamond which shone on the majors little finger for the major like a prudent man in case of any accident happening to his bank-notes had immediately converted them into an available asset then after dinner on the pretext of business he questioned the father and son upon their mode of living and the father and son previously informed that it was through danglars the one was to receive his francs and the other livres annually were so full of affability that they would have shaken hands even with the bankers servants so much did their gratitude need an object to expend itself upon one thing above all the rest heightened the respect nay almost the veneration of danglars for cavalcanti the latter faithful to the principle of horace nil admirari had contented himself with showing his knowledge by declaring in what lake the best lampreys were caught then he had eaten some without saying a word more danglars therefore concluded that such luxuries were common at the table of the illustrious descendant of the cavalcanti who most likely in lucca fed upon trout brought from switzerland and lobsters sent from england by the same means used by the count to bring the lampreys from lake fusaro and the sterlet from the volga thus it was with much politeness of manner that he heard cavalcanti pronounce these words tomorrow sir i shall have the honor of waiting upon you on business and i sir said danglars shall be most happy to receive you upon which he offered to take cavalcanti in his carriage to the htel des princes if it would not be depriving him of the company of his son to this cavalcanti replied by saying that for some time past his son had lived independently of him that he had his own horses and carriages and that not having come together it would not be difficult for them to leave separately the major seated himself therefore by the side of danglars who was more and more charmed with the ideas of order and economy which ruled this man and yet who being able to allow his son francs a year might be supposed to possess a fortune of or livres as for andrea he began by way of showing off to scold his groom who instead of bringing the tilbury to the steps of the house had taken it to the outer door thus giving him the trouble of walking thirty steps to reach it the groom heard him with humility took the bit of the impatient animal with his left hand and with the right held out the reins to andrea who taking them from him rested his polished boot lightly on the step at that moment a hand touched his shoulder the young man turned round thinking that danglars or monte cristo had forgotten something they wished to tell him and had returned just as they were starting but instead of either of these he saw nothing but a strange face sunburnt and encircled by a beard with eyes brilliant as carbuncles and a smile upon the mouth which displayed a perfect set of white teeth pointed and sharp as the wolfs or jackals a red handkerchief encircled his gray head torn and filthy garments covered his large bony limbs which seemed as though like those of a skeleton they would rattle as he walked and the hand with which he leaned upon the young mans shoulder and which was the first thing andrea saw seemed of gigantic size m did the young man recognize that face by the light of the lantern in his tilbury or was he merely struck with the horrible appearance of his interrogator we cannot say but only relate the fact that he shuddered and stepped back suddenly what do you want of me he asked pardon me my friend if i disturb you said the man with the red handkerchief but i want to speak to you you have no
