memory repeat it to me dants paused a moment then said this is it word for word the kings attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion that one edmond dants mate on board the pharaon this day arrived from smyrna after having touched at naples and porto-ferrajo has been intrusted by murat with a packet for the usurper again by the usurper with a letter for the bonapartist club in paris this proof of his guilt may be procured by his immediate arrest as the letter will be found either about his person at his fathers residence or in his cabin on board the pharaon the abb shrugged his shoulders the thing is clear as day said he and you must have had a very confiding nature as well as a good heart not to have suspected the origin of the whole affair do you really think so ah that would indeed be infamous how did danglars usually write in a handsome running hand and how was the anonymous letter written backhanded again the abb smiled disguised it was very boldly written if disguised stop a bit said the abb taking up what he called his pen and after dipping it into the ink he wrote on a piece of prepared linen with his left hand the first two or three words of the accusation dants drew back and gazed on the abb with a sensation almost amounting to terror how very astonishing cried he at length why your writing exactly resembles that of the accusation simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand and i have noticed that what that while the writing of different persons done with the right hand varies that performed with the left hand is invariably uniform you have evidently seen and observed everything let us proceed oh yes yes now as regards the second question i am listening was there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage with mercds yes a young man who loved her and his name was fernand that is a spanish name i think he was a catalan you imagine him capable of writing the letter oh no he would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a knife into me that is in strict accordance with the spanish character an assassination they will unhesitatingly commit but an act of cowardice never besides said dants the various circumstances mentioned in the letter were wholly unknown to him you had never spoken of them yourself to anyone to no one not even to your mistress no not even to my betrothed then it is danglars i feel quite sure of it now wait a little pray was danglars acquainted with fernand no yes he was now i recollect what to have seen them both sitting at table together under an arbor at pre pamphiles the evening before the day fixed for my wedding they were in earnest conversation danglars was joking in a friendly way but fernand looked pale and agitated were they alone there was a third person with them whom i knew perfectly well and who had in all probability made their acquaintance he was a tailor named caderousse but he was very drunk stay stay how strange that it should not have occurred to me before now i remember quite well that on the table round which they were sitting were pens ink and paper oh the heartless treacherous scoundrels exclaimed dants pressing his hand to his throbbing brows is there anything else i can assist you in discovering besides the villany of your friends inquired the abb with a laugh yes yes replied dants eagerly i would beg of you who see so completely to the depths of things and to whom the greatest mystery seems but an easy riddle to explain to me how it was that i underwent no second examination was never brought to trial and above all was condemned without ever having had sentence passed on me that is altogether a different and more serious matter responded the abb the ways of justice are frequently too dark and mysterious to be easily penetrated all we have hitherto done in the matter has been childs play if you wish me to enter upon the more difficult part of the business you must assist me by the most minute information on every point pray ask me whatever questions you please for in good truth you see more clearly into my life than i do myself in the first place then who examined you the kings attorney his deputy or a magistrate the deputy was he young or old about six or seven-and-twenty years of age i should say so answered the abb old enough to be ambitious but too young to be corrupt and how did he treat you with more of mildness than severity did you tell him your whole story i did and did his conduct change at all in the course of your examination he did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had brought me into this scrape he seemed quite overcome by my misfortune by your misfortune yes then you feel quite sure that it was your misfortune he deplored he gave me one great proof of his sympathy at any rate and that he burnt the sole
