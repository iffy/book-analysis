and still she wept no news of edmond no news of fernand no companionship save that of an old man who was dying with despair one evening after a day of accustomed vigil at the angle of two roads leading to marseilles from the catalans she returned to her home more depressed than ever suddenly she heard a step she knew turned anxiously around the door opened and fernand dressed in the uniform of a sub-lieutenant stood before her it was not the one she wished for most but it seemed as if a part of her past life had returned to her mercds seized fernands hands with a transport which he took for love but which was only joy at being no longer alone in the world and seeing at last a friend after long hours of solitary sorrow and then it must be confessed fernand had never been hated he was only not precisely loved another possessed all mercds heart that other was absent had disappeared perhaps was dead at this last thought mercds burst into a flood of tears and wrung her hands in agony but the thought which she had always repelled before when it was suggested to her by another came now in full force upon her mind and then too old dants incessantly said to her our edmond is dead if he were not he would return to us the old man died as i have told you had he lived mercds perchance had not become the wife of another for he would have been there to reproach her infidelity fernand saw this and when he learned of the old mans death he returned he was now a lieutenant at his first coming he had not said a word of love to mercds at the second he reminded her that he loved her mercds begged for six months more in which to await and mourn for edmond so that said the abb with a bitter smile that makes eighteen months in all what more could the most devoted lover desire then he murmured the words of the english poet frailty thy name is woman six months afterwards continued caderousse the marriage took place in the church of accoules the very church in which she was to have married edmond murmured the priest there was only a change of bridegrooms well mercds was married proceeded caderousse but although in the eyes of the world she appeared calm she nearly fainted as she passed la rserve where eighteen months before the betrothal had been celebrated with him whom she might have known she still loved had she looked to the bottom of her heart fernand more happy but not more at his ease for i saw at this time he was in constant dread of edmonds return fernand was very anxious to get his wife away and to depart himself there were too many unpleasant possibilities associated with the catalans and eight days after the wedding they left marseilles did you ever see mercds again inquired the priest yes during the spanish war at perpignan where fernand had left her she was attending to the education of her son the abb started her son said he yes replied caderousse little albert but then to be able to instruct her child continued the abb she must have received an education herself i understood from edmond that she was the daughter of a simple fisherman beautiful but uneducated oh replied caderousse did he know so little of his lovely betrothed mercds might have been a queen sir if the crown were to be placed on the heads of the loveliest and most intelligent fernands fortune was already waxing great and she developed with his growing fortune she learned drawing music everything besides i believe between ourselves she did this in order to distract her mind that she might forget and she only filled her head in order to alleviate the weight on her heart but now her position in life is assured continued caderousse no doubt fortune and honors have comforted her she is rich a countess and yet caderousse paused and yet what asked the abb yet i am sure she is not happy said caderousse what makes you believe this why when i found myself utterly destitute i thought my old friends would perhaps assist me so i went to danglars who would not even receive me i called on fernand who sent me a hundred francs by his valet-de-chambre then you did not see either of them no but madame de morcerf saw me how was that as i went away a purse fell at my feet it contained five-and-twenty louis i raised my head quickly and saw mercds who at once shut the blind and m de villefort asked the abb oh he never was a friend of mine i did not know him and i had nothing to ask of him do you not know what became of him and the share he had in edmonds misfortunes no i only know that some time after edmonds arrest he married mademoiselle de saint-mran and soon after left marseilles no doubt he has been as lucky as the rest no doubt he is as rich as danglars as high in station as fernand i only as you see have remained poor wretched and forgotten you are mistaken
