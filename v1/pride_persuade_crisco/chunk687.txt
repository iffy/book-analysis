alone heard while monte cristo examined the gilt mouldings on the ceiling are they spanish haitian or neapolitan bonds said monte cristo no said danglars smiling they are bonds on the bank of france payable to bearer stay count he added you who may be called the emperor if i claim the title of king of finance have you many pieces of paper of this size each worth a million the count took into his hands the papers which danglars had so proudly presented to him and read to the governor of the bank please pay to my order from the fund deposited by me the sum of a million and charge the same to my account baron danglars one two three four five said monte cristo five millions why what a crsus you are this is how i transact business said danglars it is really wonderful said the count above all if as i suppose it is payable at sight it is indeed said danglars it is a fine thing to have such credit really it is only in france these things are done five millions on five little scraps of paper it must be seen to be believed you do not doubt it no you say so with an accent stay you shall be convinced take my clerk to the bank and you will see him leave it with an order on the treasury for the same sum no said monte cristo folding the five notes most decidedly not the thing is so curious i will make the experiment myself i am credited on you for six millions i have drawn nine hundred thousand francs you therefore still owe me five millions and a hundred thousand francs i will take the five scraps of paper that i now hold as bonds with your signature alone and here is a receipt in full for the six millions between us i had prepared it beforehand for i am much in want of money today and monte cristo placed the bonds in his pocket with one hand while with the other he held out the receipt to danglars if a thunderbolt had fallen at the bankers feet he could not have experienced greater terror what he stammered do you mean to keep that money excuse me excuse me but i owe this money to the charity fund a deposit which i promised to pay this morning oh well then said monte cristo i am not particular about these five notes pay me in a different form i wished from curiosity to take these that i might be able to say that without any advice or preparation the house of danglars had paid me five millions without a minutes delay it would have been remarkable but here are your bonds pay me differently and he held the bonds towards danglars who seized them like a vulture extending its claws to withhold the food that is being wrested from its grasp suddenly he rallied made a violent effort to restrain himself and then a smile gradually widened the features of his disturbed countenance m certainly he said your receipt is money oh dear yes and if you were at rome the house of thomson french would make no more difficulty about paying the money on my receipt than you have just done pardon me count pardon me then i may keep this money yes said danglars while the perspiration started from the roots of his hair yes keep it keep it monte cristo replaced the notes in his pocket with that indescribable expression which seemed to say come reflect if you repent there is still time no said danglars no decidedly no keep my signatures but you know none are so formal as bankers in transacting business i intended this money for the charity fund and i seemed to be robbing them if i did not pay them with these precise bonds how absurd as if one crown were not as good as another excuse me and he began to laugh loudly but nervously certainly i excuse you said monte cristo graciously and pocket them and he placed the bonds in his pocket-book but said danglars there is still a sum of one hundred thousand francs oh a mere nothing said monte cristo the balance would come to about that sum but keep it and we shall be quits count said danglars are you speaking seriously i never joke with bankers said monte cristo in a freezing manner which repelled impertinence and he turned to the door just as the valet de chambre announced m de boville receiver-general of the charities ma foi said monte cristo i think i arrived just in time to obtain your signatures or they would have been disputed with me danglars again became pale and hastened to conduct the count out monte cristo exchanged a ceremonious bow with m de boville who was standing in the waiting-room and who was introduced into danglars room as soon as the count had left the counts serious face was illumined by a faint smile as he noticed the portfolio which the receiver-general held in his hand at the door he found his carriage and was immediately driven to the bank meanwhile danglars repressing all emotion advanced to meet the receiver-general we need not say that a smile of condescension was stamped upon his
