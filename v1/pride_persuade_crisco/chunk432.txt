we received a letter i should tell you that we lived in the little village of rogliano at the extremity of cap corse this letter was from my brother he told us that the army was disbanded and that he should return by chteauroux clermont-ferrand le puy and nmes and if i had any money he prayed me to leave it for him at nmes with an innkeeper with whom i had dealings in the smuggling line said monte cristo eh your excellency everyone must live certainly go on i loved my brother tenderly as i told your excellency and i resolved not to send the money but to take it to him myself i possessed a thousand francs i left five hundred with assunta my sister-in-law and with the other five hundred i set off for nmes it was easy to do so and as i had my boat and a lading to take in at sea everything favored my project but after we had taken in our cargo the wind became contrary so that we were four or five days without being able to enter the rhne at last however we succeeded and worked up to arles i left the boat between bellegarde and beaucaire and took the road to nmes we are getting to the story now yes your excellency excuse me but as you will see i only tell you what is absolutely necessary just at this time the famous massacres took place in the south of france three brigands called trestaillon truphemy and graffan publicly assassinated everybody whom they suspected of bonapartism you have doubtless heard of these massacres your excellency vaguely i was far from france at that period go on as i entered nmes i literally waded in blood at every step you encountered dead bodies and bands of murderers who killed plundered and burned at the sight of this slaughter and devastation i became terrified not for myself for i a simple corsican fisherman had nothing to fear on the contrary that time was most favorable for us smugglers but for my brother a soldier of the empire returning from the army of the loire with his uniform and his epaulets there was everything to apprehend i hastened to the innkeeper my misgivings had been but too true my brother had arrived the previous evening at nmes and at the very door of the house where he was about to demand hospitality he had been assassinated i did all in my power to discover the murderers but no one durst tell me their names so much were they dreaded i then thought of that french justice of which i had heard so much and which feared nothing and i went to the kings attorney and this kings attorney was named villefort asked monte cristo carelessly yes your excellency he came from marseilles where he had been deputy procureur his zeal had procured him advancement and he was said to be one of the first who had informed the government of the departure from the island of elba then said monte cristo you went to him monsieur i said my brother was assassinated yesterday in the streets of nmes i know not by whom but it is your duty to find out you are the representative of justice here and it is for justice to avenge those she has been unable to protect who was your brother asked he a lieutenant in the corsican battalion a soldier of the usurper then a soldier of the french army well replied he he has smitten with the sword and he has perished by the sword you are mistaken monsieur i replied he has perished by the poniard what do you want me to do asked the magistrate i have already told you avenge him on whom on his murderers how should i know who they are order them to be sought for why your brother has been involved in a quarrel and killed in a duel all these old soldiers commit excesses which were tolerated in the time of the emperor but which are not suffered now for the people here do not like soldiers of such disorderly conduct monsieur i replied it is not for myself that i entreat your interference i should grieve for him or avenge him but my poor brother had a wife and were anything to happen to me the poor creature would perish from want for my brothers pay alone kept her pray try and obtain a small government pension for her every revolution has its catastrophes returned m de villefort your brother has been the victim of this it is a misfortune and government owes nothing to his family if we are to judge by all the vengeance that the followers of the usurper exercised on the partisans of the king when in their turn they were in power your brother would be today in all probability condemned to death what has happened is quite natural and in conformity with the law of reprisals what cried i do you a magistrate speak thus to me all these corsicans are mad on my honor replied m de villefort they fancy that their countryman is still emperor you have mistaken the time you should have told me this two months ago it is too late now go now at once or i
