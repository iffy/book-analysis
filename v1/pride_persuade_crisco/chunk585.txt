reach to the vaulted roof above quick said a voice at the end of the gallery this voice made everyone bow before it resembling in its effect the wind passing over a field of wheat by its superior strength forcing every ear to yield obeisance as for me it made me tremble this voice was that of my father he came last clothed in his splendid robes and holding in his hand the carbine which your emperor presented him he was leaning on the shoulder of his favorite selim and he drove us all before him as a shepherd would his straggling flock my father said hayde raising her head was that illustrious man known in europe under the name of ali tepelini pasha of yanina and before whom turkey trembled albert without knowing why started on hearing these words pronounced with such a haughty and dignified accent it appeared to him as if there was something supernaturally gloomy and terrible in the expression which gleamed from the brilliant eyes of hayde at this moment she appeared like a pythoness evoking a spectre as she recalled to his mind the remembrance of the fearful death of this man to the news of which all europe had listened with horror soon said hayde we halted on our march and found ourselves on the borders of a lake my mother pressed me to her throbbing heart and at the distance of a few paces i saw my father who was glancing anxiously around four marble steps led down to the waters edge and below them was a boat floating on the tide m from where we stood i could see in the middle of the lake a large blank mass it was the kiosk to which we were going this kiosk appeared to me to be at a considerable distance perhaps on account of the darkness of the night which prevented any object from being more than partially discerned we stepped into the boat i remember well that the oars made no noise whatever in striking the water and when i leaned over to ascertain the cause i saw that they were muffled with the sashes of our palikares besides the rowers the boat contained only the women my father mother selim and myself the palikares had remained on the shore of the lake ready to cover our retreat they were kneeling on the lowest of the marble steps and in that manner intended making a rampart of the three others in case of pursuit our bark flew before the wind why does the boat go so fast asked i of my mother silence child hush we are flying i did not understand why should my father fly he the all-powerful he before whom others were accustomed to fly he who had taken for his device they hate me then they fear me it was indeed a flight which my father was trying to effect i have been told since that the garrison of the castle of yanina fatigued with long service here hayde cast a significant glance at monte cristo whose eyes had been riveted on her countenance during the whole course of her narrative the young girl then continued speaking slowly like a person who is either inventing or suppressing some feature of the history which he is relating you were saying signora said albert who was paying the most implicit attention to the recital that the garrison of yanina fatigued with long service had treated with the seraskier kourchid who had been sent by the sultan to gain possession of the person of my father it was then that ali tepelini after having sent to the sultan a french officer in whom he reposed great confidence resolved to retire to the asylum which he had long before prepared for himself and which he called kataphygion or the refuge and this officer asked albert do you remember his name signora monte cristo exchanged a rapid glance with the young girl which was quite unperceived by albert no said she i do not remember it just at this moment but if it should occur to me presently i will tell you albert was on the point of pronouncing his fathers name when monte cristo gently held up his finger in token of reproach the young man recollected his promise and was silent it was towards this kiosk that we were rowing a ground floor ornamented with arabesques bathing its terraces in the water and another floor looking on the lake was all which was visible to the eye but beneath the ground floor stretching out into the island was a large subterranean cavern to which my mother myself and the women were conducted in this place were together pouches and barrels the pouches contained of money in gold and the barrels were filled with pounds of gunpowder near the barrels stood selim my fathers favorite whom i mentioned to you just now he stood watch day and night with a lance provided with a lighted slowmatch in his hand and he had orders to blow up everything kiosk guards women gold and ali tepelini himself at the first signal given by my father i remember well that the slaves convinced of the precarious tenure on which they held their lives passed whole days and nights in praying crying and groaning as for me
