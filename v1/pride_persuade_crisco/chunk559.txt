wretched existence since the previous day with the instinct peculiar to lovers he had anticipated after the return of madame de saint-mran and the death of the marquis that something would occur at m de villeforts in connection with his attachment for valentine his presentiments were realized as we shall see and his uneasy forebodings had goaded him pale and trembling to the gate under the chestnut-trees valentine was ignorant of the cause of this sorrow and anxiety and as it was not his accustomed hour for visiting her she had gone to the spot simply by accident or perhaps through sympathy morrel called her and she ran to the gate you here at this hour said she yes my poor girl replied morrel i come to bring and to hear bad tidings this is indeed a house of mourning said valentine speak maximilian although the cup of sorrow seems already full dear valentine said morrel endeavoring to conceal his own emotion listen i entreat you what i am about to say is very serious when are you to be married i will tell you all said valentine from you i have nothing to conceal this morning the subject was introduced and my dear grandmother on whom i depended as my only support not only declared herself favorable to it but is so anxious for it that they only await the arrival of m dpinay and the following day the contract will be signed a deep sigh escaped the young man who gazed long and mournfully at her he loved alas replied he it is dreadful thus to hear my condemnation from your own lips the sentence is passed and in a few hours will be executed it must be so and i will not endeavor to prevent it but since you say nothing remains but for m dpinay to arrive that the contract may be signed and the following day you will be his tomorrow you will be engaged to m dpinay for he came this morning to paris valentine uttered a cry i was at the house of monte cristo an hour since said morrel we were speaking he of the sorrow your family had experienced and i of your grief when a carriage rolled into the courtyard never till then had i placed any confidence in presentiments but now i cannot help believing them valentine at the sound of that carriage i shuddered soon i heard steps on the staircase which terrified me as much as the footsteps of the commander did don juan the door at last opened albert de morcerf entered first and i began to hope my fears were vain when after him another young man advanced and the count exclaimed ah here is the baron franz dpinay i summoned all my strength and courage to my support perhaps i turned pale and trembled but certainly i smiled and five minutes after i left without having heard one word that had passed poor maximilian murmured valentine valentine the time has arrived when you must answer me and remember my life depends on your answer what do you intend doing valentine held down her head she was overwhelmed listen said morrel it is not the first time you have contemplated our present position which is a serious and urgent one i do not think it is a moment to give way to useless sorrow leave that for those who like to suffer at their leisure and indulge their grief in secret there are such in the world and god will doubtless reward them in heaven for their resignation on earth but those who mean to contend must not lose one precious moment but must return immediately the blow which fortune strikes do you intend to struggle against our ill-fortune tell me valentine for it is that i came to know valentine trembled and looked at him with amazement the idea of resisting her father her grandmother and all the family had never occurred to her what do you say maximilian asked valentine what do you mean by a struggle oh it would be a sacrilege what i resist my fathers order and my dying grandmothers wish impossible morrel started you are too noble not to understand me and you understand me so well that you already yield dear maximilian no no i shall need all my strength to struggle with myself and support my grief in secret as you say but to grieve my father to disturb my grandmothers last moments never you are right said morrel calmly in what a tone you speak cried valentine i speak as one who admires you mademoiselle mademoiselle cried valentine mademoiselle oh selfish man he sees me in despair and pretends he cannot understand me you mistake i understand you perfectly you will not oppose m villefort you will not displease the marchioness and tomorrow you will sign the contract which will bind you to your husband but mon dieu tell me how can i do otherwise do not appeal to me mademoiselle i shall be a bad judge in such a case my selfishness will blind me replied morrel whose low voice and clenched hands announced his growing desperation what would you have proposed maximilian had you found me willing to accede it is not for me to say you are wrong you must advise me what to do
