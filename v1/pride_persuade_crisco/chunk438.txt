rd of june go on it was from caderousse that i intended demanding shelter and as we never entered by the door that opened onto the road i resolved not to break through the rule so climbing over the garden-hedge i crept amongst the olive and wild fig trees and fearing that caderousse might have some guest i entered a kind of shed in which i had often passed the night and which was only separated from the inn by a partition in which holes had been made in order to enable us to watch an opportunity of announcing our presence my intention was if caderousse was alone to acquaint him with my presence finish the meal the custom-house officers had interrupted and profit by the threatened storm to return to the rhne and ascertain the state of our vessel and its crew i stepped into the shed and it was fortunate i did so for at that moment caderousse entered with a stranger i waited patiently not to overhear what they said but because i could do nothing else besides the same thing had occurred often before the man who was with caderousse was evidently a stranger to the south of france he was one of those merchants who come to sell jewellery at the beaucaire fair and who during the month the fair lasts and during which there is so great an influx of merchants and customers from all parts of europe often have dealings to the amount of to francs caderousse entered hastily then seeing that the room was as usual empty and only guarded by the dog he called to his wife hello carconte said he the worthy priest has not deceived us the diamond is real an exclamation of joy was heard and the staircase creaked beneath a feeble step what do you say asked his wife pale as death i say that the diamond is real and that this gentleman one of the first jewellers of paris will give us francs for it only in order to satisfy himself that it really belongs to us he wishes you to relate to him as i have done already the miraculous manner in which the diamond came into our possession in the meantime please to sit down monsieur and i will fetch you some refreshment the jeweller examined attentively the interior of the inn and the apparent poverty of the persons who were about to sell him a diamond that seemed to have come from the casket of a prince relate your story madame said he wishing no doubt to profit by the absence of the husband so that the latter could not influence the wifes story to see if the two recitals tallied oh returned she it was a gift of heaven my husband was a great friend in or of a sailor named edmond dants this poor fellow whom caderousse had forgotten had not forgotten him and at his death he bequeathed this diamond to him but how did he obtain it asked the jeweller had he it before he was imprisoned no monsieur but it appears that in prison he made the acquaintance of a rich englishman and as in prison he fell sick and dants took the same care of him as if he had been his brother the englishman when he was set free gave this stone to dants who less fortunate died and in his turn left it to us and charged the excellent abb who was here this morning to deliver it the same story muttered the jeweller and improbable as it seemed at first it may be true theres only the price we are not agreed about how not agreed about said caderousse i thought we agreed for the price i asked that is replied the jeweller i offered francs forty thousand cried la carconte we will not part with it for that sum the abb told us it was worth without the setting what was the abbs name asked the indefatigable questioner the abb busoni said la carconte he was a foreigner an italian from the neighborhood of mantua i believe let me see this diamond again replied the jeweller the first time you are often mistaken as to the value of a stone caderousse took from his pocket a small case of black shagreen opened and gave it to the jeweller at the sight of the diamond which was as large as a hazel-nut la carcontes eyes sparkled with cupidity and what did you think of this fine story eavesdropper said monte cristo did you credit it yes your excellency i did not look on caderousse as a bad man and i thought him incapable of committing a crime or even a theft that did more honor to your heart than to your experience m bertuccio had you known this edmond dants of whom they spoke no your excellency i had never heard of him before and never but once afterwards and that was from the abb busoni himself when i saw him in the prison at nmes go on the jeweller took the ring and drawing from his pocket a pair of steel pliers and a small set of copper scales he took the stone out of its setting and weighed it carefully i will give you said he but not a sou more besides as that
