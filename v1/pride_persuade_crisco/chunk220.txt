riding out the heaviest weather your feelings may be the strongest replied anne but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender man is more robust than woman but he is not longer lived which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments nay it would be too hard upon you if it were otherwise you have difficulties and privations and dangers enough to struggle with you are always labouring and toiling exposed to every risk and hardship your home country friends all quitted neither time nor health nor life to be called your own it would be hard indeed with a faltering voice if woman's feelings were to be added to all this we shall never agree upon this question captain harville was beginning to say when a slight noise called their attention to captain wentworth's hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room it was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down but anne was startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed and half inclined to suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been occupied by them striving to catch sounds which yet she did not think he could have caught have you finished your letter said captain harville not quite a few lines more i shall have done in five minutes there is no hurry on my side i am only ready whenever you are i am in very good anchorage here smiling at anne well supplied and want for nothing no hurry for a signal at all well miss elliot lowering his voice as i was saying we shall never agree i suppose upon this point no man and woman would probably but let me observe that all histories are against you--all stories prose and verse if i had such a memory as benwick i could bring you fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument and i do not think i ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon woman's inconstancy songs and proverbs all talk of woman's fickleness but perhaps you will say these were all written by men perhaps i shall yes yes if you please no reference to examples in books men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story education has been theirs in so much higher a degree the pen has been in their hands i will not allow books to prove anything but how shall we prove anything we never shall we never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point it is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof we each begin probably with a little bias towards our own sex and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has occurred within our own circle many of which circumstances perhaps those very cases which strike us the most may be precisely such as cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence or in some respect saying what should not be said ah cried captain harville in a tone of strong feeling if i could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes a last look at his wife and children and watches the boat that he has sent them off in as long as it is in sight and then turns away and says god knows whether we ever meet again and then if i could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does see them again when coming back after a twelvemonth's absence perhaps and obliged to put into another port he calculates how soon it be possible to get them there pretending to deceive himself and saying they cannot be here till such a day but all the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner and seeing them arrive at last as if heaven had given them wings by many hours sooner still if i could explain to you all this and all that a man can bear and do and glories to do for the sake of these treasures of his existence i speak you know only of such men as have hearts pressing his own with emotion oh cried anne eagerly i hope i do justice to all that is felt by you and by those who resemble you god forbid that i should undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow-creatures i should deserve utter contempt if i dared to suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman no i believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives i believe you equal to every important exertion and to every domestic forbearance so long as--if i may be allowed the expression--so long as you have an object i mean while the woman you love lives and lives for you all the privilege i claim for my own sex it is not a very enviable one you need not covet it is that of loving longest when existence or when hope is gone she could not immediately have uttered another sentence her heart was too full her breath too much oppressed you are a good soul cried captain harville putting his hand on her arm quite affectionately there is no quarrelling with you and when
