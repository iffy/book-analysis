the pride of villefort hardly had he read the letter when his wife entered the sudden departure of franz after being summoned by m noirtier had so much astonished everyone that the position of madame de villefort left alone with the notary and the witnesses became every moment more embarrassing determined to bear it no longer she arose and left the room saying she would go and make some inquiries into the cause of his sudden disappearance m de villeforts communications on the subject were very limited and concise he told her in fact that an explanation had taken place between m noirtier m dpinay and himself and that the marriage of valentine and franz would consequently be broken off this was an awkward and unpleasant thing to have to report to those who were waiting she therefore contented herself with saying that m noirtier having at the commencement of the discussion been attacked by a sort of apoplectic fit the affair would necessarily be deferred for some days longer this news false as it was following so singularly in the train of the two similar misfortunes which had so recently occurred evidently astonished the auditors and they retired without a word during this time valentine at once terrified and happy after having embraced and thanked the feeble old man for thus breaking with a single blow the chain which she had been accustomed to consider as irrefragable asked leave to retire to her own room in order to recover her composure noirtier looked the permission which she solicited but instead of going to her own room valentine having once gained her liberty entered the gallery and opening a small door at the end of it found herself at once in the garden in the midst of all the strange events which had crowded one on the other an indefinable sentiment of dread had taken possession of valentines mind she expected every moment that she should see morrel appear pale and trembling to forbid the signing of the contract like the laird of ravenswood in the bride of lammermoor it was high time for her to make her appearance at the gate for maximilian had long awaited her coming he had half guessed what was going on when he saw franz quit the cemetery with m de villefort he followed m dpinay saw him enter afterwards go out and then re-enter with albert and chteau-renaud he had no longer any doubts as to the nature of the conference he therefore quickly went to the gate in the clover-patch prepared to hear the result of the proceedings and very certain that valentine would hasten to him the first moment she should be set at liberty he was not mistaken peering through the crevices of the wooden partition he soon discovered the young girl who cast aside all her usual precautions and walked at once to the barrier the first glance which maximilian directed towards her entirely reassured him and the first words she spoke made his heart bound with delight we are saved said valentine saved repeated morrel not being able to conceive such intense happiness by whom by my grandfather oh morrel pray love him for all his goodness to us morrel swore to love him with all his soul and at that moment he could safely promise to do so for he felt as though it were not enough to love him merely as a friend or even as a father he worshiped him as a god but tell me valentine how has it all been effected what strange means has he used to compass this blessed end valentine was on the point of relating all that had passed but she suddenly remembered that in doing so she must reveal a terrible secret which concerned others as well as her grandfather and she said at some future time i will tell you all about it but when will that be when i am your wife the conversation had now turned upon a topic so pleasing to morrel that he was ready to accede to anything that valentine thought fit to propose and he likewise felt that a piece of intelligence such as he just heard ought to be more than sufficient to content him for one day however he would not leave without the promise of seeing valentine again the next night valentine promised all that morrel required of her and certainly it was less difficult now for her to believe that she should marry maximilian than it was an hour ago to assure herself that she should not marry franz during the time occupied by the interview we have just detailed madame de villefort had gone to visit m noirtier the old man looked at her with that stern and forbidding expression with which he was accustomed to receive her sir said she it is superfluous for me to tell you that valentines marriage is broken off since it was here that the affair was concluded noirtiers countenance remained immovable but one thing i can tell you of which i do not think you are aware that is that i have always been opposed to this marriage and that the contract was entered into entirely without my consent or approbation noirtier regarded his daughter-in-law with the look of a man desiring an explanation now that this marriage which i know
