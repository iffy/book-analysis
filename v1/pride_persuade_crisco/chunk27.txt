malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as this after a few minutes reflection however she continued i do remember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability of his resentments of his having an unforgiving temper his disposition must be dreadful i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham i can hardly be just to him elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed to treat in such a manner the godson the friend the favourite of his father she could have added a young man too like you whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable but she contented herself with and one too who had probably been his companion from childhood connected together as i think you said in the closest manner we were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest part of our youth was passed together inmates of the same house sharing the same amusements objects of the same parental care my father began life in the profession which your uncle mr phillips appears to do so much credit to but he gave up everything to be of use to the late mr darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property he was most highly esteemed by mr darcy a most intimate confidential friend mr darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my fathers active superintendence and when immediately before my fathers death mr darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of his affection to myself how strange cried elizabeth how abominable i wonder that the very pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to you if from no better motive that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest for dishonesty i must call it it is wonderful replied wickham for almost all his actions may be traced to pride and pride had often been his best friend it has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling but we are none of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good yes it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poor family pride and filial pride for he is very proud of what his father was have done this not to appear to disgrace his family to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the pemberley house is a powerful motive he has also brotherly pride which with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers what sort of girl is miss darcy he shook his head i wish i could call her amiable it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy but she is too much like her brother very very proud as a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fond of me and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement but she is nothing to me now she is a handsome girl about fifteen or sixteen and i understand highly accomplished since her fathers death her home has been london where a lady lives with her and superintends her education after many pauses and many trials of other subjects elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first and saying i am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley how can mr bingley who seems good humour itself and is i really believe truly amiable be in friendship with such a man how can they suit each other do you know mr bingley not at all he is a sweet-tempered amiable charming man he cannot know what mr darcy is probably not but mr darcy can please where he chooses he does not want abilities he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous his pride never deserts him but with the rich he is liberal-minded just sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeable allowing something for fortune and figure the whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round the other table and mr collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs phillips the usual enquiries as to his success were made by the latter it had not been very great he had lost every point but when mrs phillips began to express her concern thereupon he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged that she would not make herself uneasy i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a card-table they must take their chances of these things and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to
