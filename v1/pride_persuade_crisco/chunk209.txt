so direct a line as that it takes a bend or two but nothing of consequence the stream is as good as at first the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easily moved away mr elliot talks unreservedly to colonel wallis of his views on you which said colonel wallis i imagine to be in himself a sensible careful discerning sort of character but colonel wallis has a very pretty silly wife to whom he tells things which he had better not and he repeats it all to her she in the overflowing spirits of her recovery repeats it all to her nurse and the nurse knowing my acquaintance with you very naturally brings it all to me on monday evening my good friend mrs rooke let me thus much into the secrets of marlborough buildings when i talked of a whole history therefore you see i was not romancing so much as you supposed my dear mrs smith your authority is deficient this will not do mr elliot's having any views on me will not in the least account for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father that was all prior to my coming to bath i found them on the most friendly terms when i arrived i know you did i know it all perfectly but indeed mrs smith we must not expect to get real information in such a line facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so many to be misconceived by folly in one and ignorance in another can hardly have much truth left only give me a hearing you will soon be able to judge of the general credit due by listening to some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm nobody supposes that you were his first inducement he had seen you indeed before he came to bath and admired you but without knowing it to be you so says my historian at least is this true did he see you last summer or autumn somewhere down in the west to use her own words without knowing it to be you he certainly did so far it is very true at lyme i happened to be at lyme well continued mrs smith triumphantly grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted he saw you then at lyme and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in camden place as miss anne elliot and from that moment i have no doubt had a double motive in his visits there but there was another and an earlier which i will now explain if there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable stop me my account states that your sister's friend the lady now staying with you whom i have heard you mention came to bath with miss elliot and sir walter as long ago as september in short when they first came themselves and has been staying there ever since that she is a clever insinuating handsome woman poor and plausible and altogether such in situation and manner as to give a general idea among sir walter's acquaintance of her meaning to be lady elliot and as general a surprise that miss elliot should be apparently blind to the danger here mrs smith paused a moment but anne had not a word to say and she continued this was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family long before you returned to it and colonel wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it though he did not then visit in camden place but his regard for mr elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there and when mr elliot came to bath for a day or two as he happened to do a little before christmas colonel wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things and the reports beginning to prevail now you are to understand that time had worked a very material change in mr elliot's opinions as to the value of a baronetcy upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man having long had as much money as he could spend nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to i thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased but it is now a confirmed feeling he cannot bear the idea of not being sir william you may guess therefore that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable and you may guess what it produced the resolution of coming back to bath as soon as possible and of fixing himself here for a time with the view of renewing his former acquaintance and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger and of circumventing the lady if he found it material this was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done and colonel wallis was to assist in every way that he could he was to be introduced and mrs wallis was to be
