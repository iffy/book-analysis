countess without replying to the question no madame replied monte cristo but you see i make no resistance we are going to the greenhouse that you see at the other end of the grove the count looked at mercds as if to interrogate her but she continued to walk on in silence and he refrained from speaking they reached the building ornamented with magnificent fruits which ripen at the beginning of july in the artificial temperature which takes the place of the sun so frequently absent in our climate the countess left the arm of monte cristo and gathered a bunch of muscatel grapes see count she said with a smile so sad in its expression that one could almost detect the tears on her eyelids see our french grapes are not to be compared i know with yours of sicily and cyprus but you will make allowance for our northern sun the count bowed but stepped back do you refuse said mercds in a tremulous voice pray excuse me madame replied monte cristo but i never eat muscatel grapes mercds let them fall and sighed a magnificent peach was hanging against an adjoining wall ripened by the same artificial heat mercds drew near and plucked the fruit take this peach then she said the count again refused what again she exclaimed in so plaintive an accent that it seemed to stifle a sob really you pain me a long silence followed the peach like the grapes fell to the ground count added mercds with a supplicating glance there is a beautiful arabian custom which makes eternal friends of those who have together eaten bread and salt under the same roof i know it madame replied the count but we are in france and not in arabia and in france eternal friendships are as rare as the custom of dividing bread and salt with one another but said the countess breathlessly with her eyes fixed on monte cristo whose arm she convulsively pressed with both hands we are friends are we not the count became pale as death the blood rushed to his heart and then again rising dyed his cheeks with crimson his eyes swam like those of a man suddenly dazzled certainly we are friends he replied why should we not be the answer was so little like the one mercds desired that she turned away to give vent to a sigh which sounded more like a groan thank you she said and they walked on again they went the whole length of the garden without uttering a word sir suddenly exclaimed the countess after their walk had continued ten minutes in silence is it true that you have seen so much travelled so far and suffered so deeply i have suffered deeply madame answered monte cristo but now you are happy doubtless replied the count since no one hears me complain and your present happiness has it softened your heart my present happiness equals my past misery said the count are you not married asked the countess i married exclaimed monte cristo shuddering who could have told you so no one told me you were but you have frequently been seen at the opera with a young and lovely woman she is a slave whom i bought at constantinople madame the daughter of a prince i have adopted her as my daughter having no one else to love in the world you live alone then i do you have no sister no son no father i have no one how can you exist thus without anyone to attach you to life it is not my fault madame at malta i loved a young girl was on the point of marrying her when war came and carried me away i thought she loved me well enough to wait for me and even to remain faithful to my memory when i returned she was married this is the history of most men who have passed twenty years of age perhaps my heart was weaker than the hearts of most men and i suffered more than they would have done in my place that is all the countess stopped for a moment as if gasping for breath yes she said and you have still preserved this love in your heart one can only love once and did you ever see her again m never never i never returned to the country where she lived to malta yes malta she is then now at malta i think so and have you forgiven her for all she has made you suffer her yes but only her do you then still hate those who separated you i hate them not at all why should i the countess placed herself before monte cristo still holding in her hand a portion of the perfumed grapes take some she said madame i never eat muscatel grapes replied monte cristo as if the subject had not been mentioned before the countess dashed the grapes into the nearest thicket with a gesture of despair inflexible man she murmured monte cristo remained as unmoved as if the reproach had not been addressed to him albert at this moment ran in oh mother he exclaimed such a misfortune has happened what what has happened asked the countess as though awakening from a sleep to the realities of life did you say a
