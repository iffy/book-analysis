danglars in order that his wounds might be examined he was undressed and his clothes were thrown into a corner where the police picked them up with the exception of the waistcoat which they overlooked andrea turned pale and drew towards the door he saw a cloud rising in the horizon which appeared to forebode a coming storm well this waistcoat was discovered today covered with blood and with a hole over the heart the ladies screamed and two or three prepared to faint it was brought to me no one could guess what the dirty rag could be i alone suspected that it was the waistcoat of the murdered man my valet in examining this mournful relic felt a paper in the pocket and drew it out it was a letter addressed to you baron to me cried danglars yes indeed to you i succeeded in deciphering your name under the blood with which the letter was stained replied monte cristo amid the general outburst of amazement but asked madame danglars looking at her husband with uneasiness how could that
