they reached it but it was not the friend once the cab was also passed by a calash rapidly whirled along by two post-horses ah said cavalcanti to himself if i only had that britzka those two good post-horses and above all the passport that carries them on and he sighed deeply the calash contained mademoiselle danglars and mademoiselle darmilly hurry hurry said andrea we must overtake him soon and the poor horse resumed the desperate gallop it had kept up since leaving the barrier and arrived steaming at louvres certainly said andrea i shall not overtake my friend but i shall kill your horse therefore i had better stop here are thirty francs i will sleep at the cheval rouge and will secure a place in the first coach good-night friend and andrea after placing six pieces of five francs each in the mans hand leaped lightly on to the pathway the cabman joyfully pocketed the sum and turned back on his road to paris andrea pretended to go towards the hotel of the cheval rouge but after leaning an instant against the door and hearing the last sound of the cab which was disappearing from view he went on his road and with a lusty stride soon traversed the space of two leagues then he rested he must be near chapelle-en-serval where he pretended to be going it was not fatigue that stayed andrea here it was that he might form some resolution adopt some plan it would be impossible to make use of a diligence equally so to engage post-horses to travel either way a passport was necessary it was still more impossible to remain in the department of the oise one of the most open and strictly guarded in france this was quite out of the question especially to a man like andrea perfectly conversant with criminal matters he sat down by the side of the moat buried his face in his hands and reflected ten minutes after he raised his head his resolution was made he threw some dust over the topcoat which he had found time to unhook from the antechamber and button over his ball costume and going to chapelle-en-serval he knocked loudly at the door of the only inn in the place the host opened my friend said andrea i was coming from mortefontaine to senlis when my horse which is a troublesome creature stumbled and threw me i must reach compigne tonight or i shall cause deep anxiety to my family could you let me hire a horse of you an innkeeper has always a horse to let whether it be good or bad the host called the stable-boy and ordered him to saddle le blanc then he awoke his son a child of seven years whom he ordered to ride before the gentleman and bring back the horse andrea gave the innkeeper twenty francs and in taking them from his pocket dropped a visiting card this belonged to one of his friends at the caf de paris so that the innkeeper picking it up after andrea had left was convinced that he had let his horse to the count of maulon rue saint-dominique that being the name and address on the card le blanc was not a fast animal but he kept up an easy steady pace in three hours and a half andrea had traversed the nine leagues which separated him from compigne and four oclock struck as he reached the place where the coaches stop there is an excellent tavern at compigne well remembered by those who have ever been there andrea who had often stayed there in his rides about paris recollected the bell and bottle inn he turned around saw the sign by the light of a reflected lamp and having dismissed the child giving him all the small coin he had about him he began knocking at the door very reasonably concluding that having now three or four hours before him he had best fortify himself against the fatigues of the morrow by a sound sleep and a good supper a waiter opened the door my friend said andrea i have been dining at saint-jean-aux-bois and expected to catch the coach which passes by at midnight but like a fool i have lost my way and have been walking for the last four hours in the forest show me into one of those pretty little rooms which overlook the court and bring me a cold fowl and a bottle of bordeaux the waiter had no suspicions andrea spoke with perfect composure he had a cigar in his mouth and his hands in the pocket of his top coat his clothes were fashionably made his chin smooth his boots irreproachable he looked merely as if he had stayed out very late that was all while the waiter was preparing his room the hostess arose andrea assumed his most charming smile and asked if he could have no which he had occupied on his last stay at compigne unfortunately no was engaged by a young man who was travelling with his sister andrea appeared in despair but consoled himself when the hostess assured him that no prepared for him was situated precisely the same as no and while warming his feet and chatting about the last races at chantilly he waited until they announced his room to be ready
