villefort approached the bed and looked fixedly on valentine the dim light the profound silence and the gloomy thoughts inspired by the hour and still more by her own conscience all combined to produce a sensation of fear the poisoner was terrified at the contemplation of her own work at length she rallied drew aside the curtain and leaning over the pillow gazed intently on valentine the young girl no longer breathed no breath issued through the half-closed teeth the white lips no longer quivered the eyes were suffused with a bluish vapor and the long black lashes rested on a cheek white as wax madame de villefort gazed upon the face so expressive even in its stillness then she ventured to raise the coverlet and press her hand upon the young girls heart it was cold and motionless she only felt the pulsation in her own fingers and withdrew her hand with a shudder one arm was hanging out of the bed from shoulder to elbow it was moulded after the arms of germain pillons graces but the fore-arm seemed to be slightly distorted by convulsion and the hand so delicately formed was resting with stiff outstretched fingers on the framework of the bed the nails too were turning blue madame de villefort had no longer any doubt all was over she had consummated the last terrible work she had to accomplish there was no more to do in the room so the poisoner retired stealthily as though fearing to hear the sound of her own footsteps but as she withdrew she still held aside the curtain absorbed in the irresistible attraction always exerted by the picture of death so long as it is merely mysterious and does not excite disgust the minutes passed madame de villefort could not drop the curtain which she held like a funeral pall over the head of valentine she was lost in reverie and the reverie of crime is remorse just then the lamp again flickered the noise startled madame de villefort who shuddered and dropped the curtain immediately afterwards the light expired and the room was plunged in frightful obscurity while the clock at that minute struck half-past four overpowered with agitation the poisoner succeeded in groping her way to the door and reached her room in an agony of fear the darkness lasted two hours longer then by degrees a cold light crept through the venetian blinds until at length it revealed the objects in the room about this time the nurses cough was heard on the stairs and the woman entered the room with a cup in her hand to the tender eye of a father or a lover the first glance would have sufficed to reveal valentines condition but to this hireling valentine only appeared to sleep good she exclaimed approaching the table she has taken part of her draught the glass is three-quarters empty then she went to the fireplace and lit the fire and although she had just left her bed she could not resist the temptation offered by valentines sleep so she threw herself into an armchair to snatch a little more rest the clock striking eight awoke her astonished at the prolonged slumber of the patient and frightened to see that the arm was still hanging out of the bed she advanced towards valentine and for the first time noticed the white lips she tried to replace the arm but it moved with a frightful rigidity which could not deceive a sick-nurse she screamed aloud then running to the door exclaimed help help m what is the matter asked m davrigny at the foot of the stairs it being the hour he usually visited her what is it asked villefort rushing from his room doctor do you hear them call for help yes yes let us hasten up it was in valentines room but before the doctor and the father could reach the room the servants who were on the same floor had entered and seeing valentine pale and motionless on her bed they lifted up their hands towards heaven and stood transfixed as though struck by lightening call madame de villefort wake madame de villefort cried the procureur from the door of his chamber which apparently he scarcely dared to leave but instead of obeying him the servants stood watching m davrigny who ran to valentine and raised her in his arms what this one too he exclaimed oh where will be the end villefort rushed into the room what are you saying doctor he exclaimed raising his hands to heaven i say that valentine is dead replied davrigny in a voice terrible in its solemn calmness m m de villefort staggered and buried his head in the bed on the exclamation of the doctor and the cry of the father the servants all fled with muttered imprecations they were heard running down the stairs and through the long passages then there was a rush in the court afterwards all was still they had one and all deserted the accursed house just then madame de villefort in the act of slipping on her dressing-gown threw aside the drapery and for a moment stood motionless as though interrogating the occupants of the room while she endeavored to call up some rebellious tears on a sudden she stepped or rather bounded with outstretched arms towards the table she
