could it is over it is over she repeated to herself again and again in nervous gratitude the worst is over mary talked but she could not attend she had seen him they had met they had been once more in the same room soon however she began to reason with herself and try to be feeling less eight years almost eight years had passed since all had been given up how absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval had banished into distance and indistinctness what might not eight years do events of every description changes alienations removals--all all must be comprised in it and oblivion of the past how natural how certain too it included nearly a third part of her own life alas with all her reasoning she found that to retentive feelings eight years may be little more than nothing now how were his sentiments to be read was this like wishing to avoid her and the next moment she was hating herself for the folly which asked the question on one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have prevented she was soon spared all suspense for after the miss musgroves had returned and finished their visit at the cottage she had this spontaneous information from mary captain wentworth is not very gallant by you anne though he was so attentive to me henrietta asked him what he thought of you when they went away and he said you were so altered he should not have known you again mary had no feelings to make her respect her sister's in a common way but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound altered beyond his knowledge anne fully submitted in silent deep mortification doubtless it was so and she could take no revenge for he was not altered or not for the worse she had already acknowledged it to herself and she could not think differently let him think of her as he would no the years which had destroyed her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing manly open look in no respect lessening his personal advantages she had seen the same frederick wentworth so altered that he should not have known her again these were words which could not but dwell with her yet she soon began to rejoice that she had heard them they were of sobering tendency they allayed agitation they composed and consequently must make her happier frederick wentworth had used such words or something like them but without an idea that they would be carried round to her he had thought her wretchedly altered and in the first moment of appeal had spoken as he felt he had not forgiven anne elliot she had used him ill deserted and disappointed him and worse she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so which his own decided confident temper could not endure she had given him up to oblige others it had been the effect of over-persuasion it had been weakness and timidity he had been most warmly attached to her and had never seen a woman since whom he thought her equal but except from some natural sensation of curiosity he had no desire of meeting her again her power with him was gone for ever it was now his object to marry he was rich and being turned on shore fully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted actually looking round ready to fall in love with all the speed which a clear head and a quick taste could allow he had a heart for either of the miss musgroves if they could catch it a heart in short for any pleasing young woman who came in his way excepting anne elliot this was his only secret exception when he said to his sister in answer to her suppositions yes here i am sophia quite ready to make a foolish match anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking a little beauty and a few smiles and a few compliments to the navy and i am a lost man should not this be enough for a sailor who has had no society among women to make him nice he said it she knew to be contradicted his bright proud eye spoke the conviction that he was nice and anne elliot was not out of his thoughts when he more seriously described the woman he should wish to meet with a strong mind with sweetness of manner made the first and the last of the description that is the woman i want said he something a little inferior i shall of course put up with but it must not be much if i am a fool i shall be a fool indeed for i have thought on the subject more than most men chapter from this time captain wentworth and anne elliot were repeatedly in the same circle they were soon dining in company together at mr musgrove's for the little boy's state could no longer supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself and this was but the beginning of other dinings and other meetings whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each they could not but
