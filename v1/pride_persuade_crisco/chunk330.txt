intended for faithful friendship that is true enough returned caderousse you say truly the gift of poor edmond was not meant for such traitors as fernand and danglars besides what would it be to them no more than a drop of water in the ocean remember chimed in la carconte those two could crush you at a single blow how so inquired the abb are these persons then so rich and powerful do you not know their history i do not pray relate it to me caderousse seemed to reflect for a few moments then said no truly it would take up too much time well my good friend returned the abb in a tone that indicated utter indifference on his part you are at liberty either to speak or be silent just as you please for my own part i respect your scruples and admire your sentiments so let the matter end i shall do my duty as conscientiously as i can and fulfil my promise to the dying man my first business will be to dispose of this diamond so saying the abb again drew the small box from his pocket opened it and contrived to hold it in such a light that a bright flash of brilliant hues passed before the dazzled gaze of caderousse wife wife cried he in a hoarse voice come here diamond exclaimed la carconte rising and descending to the chamber with a tolerably firm step what diamond are you talking about why did you not hear all we said inquired caderousse it is a beautiful diamond left by poor edmond dants to be sold and the money divided between his father mercds his betrothed bride fernand danglars and myself the jewel is worth at least fifty thousand francs oh what a magnificent jewel cried the astonished woman the fifth part of the profits from this stone belongs to us then does it not asked caderousse it does replied the abb with the addition of an equal division of that part intended for the elder dants which i believe myself at liberty to divide equally with the four survivors and why among us four inquired caderousse as being the friends edmond esteemed most faithful and devoted to him i dont call those friends who betray and ruin you murmured the wife in her turn in a low muttering voice of course not rejoined caderousse quickly no more do i and that was what i was observing to this gentleman just now i said i looked upon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery perhaps crime remember answered the abb calmly as he replaced the jewel and its case in the pocket of his cassock it is your fault not mine that i do so you will have the goodness to furnish me with the address of both fernand and danglars in order that i may execute edmonds last wishes the agitation of caderousse became extreme and large drops of perspiration rolled from his heated brow as he saw the abb rise from his seat and go towards the door as though to ascertain if his horse were sufficiently refreshed to continue his journey caderousse and his wife exchanged looks of deep meaning m there you see wife said the former this splendid diamond might all be ours if we chose do you believe it why surely a man of his holy profession would not deceive us well replied la carconte do as you like for my part i wash my hands of the affair so saying she once more climbed the staircase leading to her chamber her body convulsed with chills and her teeth rattling in her head in spite of the intense heat of the weather arrived at the top stair she turned round and called out in a warning tone to her husband gaspard consider well what you are about to do i have both reflected and decided answered he la carconte then entered her chamber the flooring of which creaked beneath her heavy uncertain tread as she proceeded towards her armchair into which she fell as though exhausted well asked the abb as he returned to the apartment below what have you made up your mind to do to tell you all i know was the reply i certainly think you act wisely in so doing said the priest not because i have the least desire to learn anything you may please to conceal from me but simply that if through your assistance i could distribute the legacy according to the wishes of the testator why so much the better that is all i hope it may be so replied caderousse his face flushed with cupidity i am all attention said the abb stop a minute answered caderousse we might be interrupted in the most interesting part of my story which would be a pity and it is as well that your visit hither should be made known only to ourselves with these words he went stealthily to the door which he closed and by way of still greater precaution bolted and barred it as he was accustomed to do at night during this time the abb had chosen his place for listening at his ease he removed his seat into a corner of the room where he himself would be in deep shadow while the light would be fully thrown
