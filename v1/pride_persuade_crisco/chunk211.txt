to without corresponding indignation anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion answers to urgent applications from mrs smith which all breathed the same stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble and under a cold civility the same hard-hearted indifference to any of the evils it might bring on her it was a dreadful picture of ingratitude and inhumanity and anne felt at some moments that no flagrant open crime could have been worse she had a great deal to listen to all the particulars of past sad scenes all the minutiae of distress upon distress which in former conversations had been merely hinted at were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief and was only the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend's usual state of mind there was one circumstance in the history of her grievances of particular irritation she had good reason to believe that some property of her husband in the west indies which had been for many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment of its own incumbrances might be recoverable by proper measures and this property though not large would be enough to make her comparatively rich but there was nobody to stir in it mr elliot would do nothing and she could do nothing herself equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of bodily weakness and from employing others by her want of money she had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law this was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means to feel that she ought to be in better circumstances that a little trouble in the right place might do it and to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims was hard to bear it was on this point that she had hoped to engage anne's good offices with mr elliot she had previously in the anticipation of their marriage been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature since he did not even know her to be in bath it immediately occurred that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he loved and she had been hastily preparing to interest anne's feelings as far as the observances due to mr elliot's character would allow when anne's refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of everything and while it took from her the new-formed hope of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety left her at least the comfort of telling the whole story her own way after listening to this full description of mr elliot anne could not but express some surprise at mrs smith's having spoken of him so favourably in the beginning of their conversation she had seemed to recommend and praise him my dear was mrs smith's reply there was nothing else to be done i considered your marrying him as certain though he might not yet have made the offer and i could no more speak the truth of him than if he had been your husband my heart bled for you as i talked of happiness and yet he is sensible he is agreeable and with such a woman as you it was not absolutely hopeless he was very unkind to his first wife they were wretched together but she was too ignorant and giddy for respect and he had never loved her i was willing to hope that you must fare better anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him as made her shudder at the idea of the misery which must have followed it was just possible that she might have been persuaded by lady russell and under such a supposition which would have been most miserable when time had disclosed all too late it was very desirable that lady russell should be no longer deceived and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference which carried them through the greater part of the morning was that anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend everything relative to mrs smith in which his conduct was involved chapter anne went home to think over all that she had heard in one point her feelings were relieved by this knowledge of mr elliot there was no longer anything of tenderness due to him he stood as opposed to captain wentworth in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness and the evil of his attentions last night the irremediable mischief he might have done was considered with sensations unqualified unperplexed pity for him was all over but this was the only point of relief in every other respect in looking around her or penetrating forward she saw more to distrust and to apprehend she was concerned for the disappointment and pain lady russell would be feeling for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils without knowing how to avert any one of them she was most thankful for her own knowledge of him she had never considered herself as entitled to reward for not slighting an old friend like mrs smith
