terrible relapse there was only this blow wanting then he said aloud my dear friend your attack has perhaps fatigued you had you not better repose awhile tomorrow if you will i will hear your narrative but today i wish to nurse you carefully besides he said a treasure is not a thing we need hurry about on the contrary it is a matter of the utmost importance edmond replied the old man who knows if tomorrow or the next day after the third attack may not come on and then must not all be over yes indeed i have often thought with a bitter joy that these riches which would make the wealth of a dozen families will be forever lost to those men who persecute me this idea was one of vengeance to me and i tasted it slowly in the night of my dungeon and the despair of my captivity but now i have forgiven the world for the love of you now that i see you young and with a promising future now that i think of all that may result to you in the good fortune of such a disclosure i shudder at any delay and tremble lest i should not assure to one as worthy as yourself the possession of so vast an amount of hidden wealth edmond turned away his head with a sigh you persist in your incredulity edmond continued faria my words have not convinced you i see you require proofs well then read this paper which i have never shown to anyone tomorrow my dear friend said edmond desirous of not yielding to the old mans madness i thought it was understood that we should not talk of that until tomorrow then we will not talk of it until tomorrow but read this paper today i will not irritate him thought edmond and taking the paper of which half was wanting having been burnt no doubt by some accident he read this treasure which may amount to two of roman crowns in the most distant a of the second opening wh declare to belong to him alo heir th april well said faria when the young man had finished reading it why replied dants i see nothing but broken lines and unconnected words which are rendered illegible by fire yes to you my friend who read them for the first time but not for me who have grown pale over them by many nights study and have reconstructed every phrase completed every thought and do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning i am sure i have and you shall judge for yourself but first listen to the history of this paper silence exclaimed dants steps approach i go adieu and dants happy to escape the history and explanation which would be sure to confirm his belief in his friends mental instability glided like a snake along the narrow passage while faria restored by his alarm to a certain amount of activity pushed the stone into place with his foot and covered it with a mat in order the more effectually to avoid discovery it was the governor who hearing of farias illness from the jailer had come in person to see him faria sat up to receive him avoiding all gestures in order that he might conceal from the governor the paralysis that had already half stricken him with death his fear was lest the governor touched with pity might order him to be removed to better quarters and thus separate him from his young companion but fortunately this was not the case and the governor left him convinced that the poor madman for whom in his heart he felt a kind of affection was only troubled with a slight indisposition during this time edmond seated on his bed with his head in his hands tried to collect his scattered thoughts faria since their first acquaintance had been on all points so rational and logical so wonderfully sagacious in fact that he could not understand how so much wisdom on all points could be allied with madness was faria deceived as to his treasure or was all the world deceived as to faria dants remained in his cell all day not daring to return to his friend thinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced once for all that the abb was mad such a conviction would be so terrible but towards the evening after the hour for the customary visit had gone by faria not seeing the young man appear tried to move and get over the distance which separated them edmond shuddered when he heard the painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along his leg was inert and he could no longer make use of one arm edmond was obliged to assist him for otherwise he would not have been able to enter by the small aperture which led to dants chamber here i am pursuing you remorselessly he said with a benignant smile you thought to escape my munificence but it is in vain listen to me edmond saw there was no escape and placing the old man on his bed he seated himself on the stool beside him you know said the abb that i was the secretary and intimate friend of cardinal spada the last of the princes
