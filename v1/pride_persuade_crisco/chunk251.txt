to the magistrate to hear his words why if my information prove correct a sort of bonapartist conspiracy has just been discovered can i believe my ears cried the marquise i will read you the letter containing the accusation at least said villefort the kings attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the religious institutions of his country that one named edmond dants mate of the ship pharaon this day arrived from smyrna after having touched at naples and porto-ferrajo has been the bearer of a letter from murat to the usurper and again taken charge of another letter from the usurper to the bonapartist club in paris ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the above-mentioned edmond dants who either carries the letter for paris about with him or has it at his fathers abode should it not be found in the possession of father or son then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said dants on board the pharaon but said rene this letter which after all is but an anonymous scrawl is not even addressed to you but to the kings attorney m true but that gentleman being absent his secretary by his orders opened his letters thinking this one of importance he sent for me but not finding me took upon himself to give the necessary orders for arresting the accused party then the guilty person is absolutely in custody said the marquise nay dear mother say the accused person you know we cannot yet pronounce him guilty he is in safe custody answered villefort and rely upon it if the letter is found he will not be likely to be trusted abroad again unless he goes forth under the especial protection of the headsman and where is the unfortunate being asked rene he is at my house come come my friend interrupted the marquise do not neglect your duty to linger with us you are the kings servant and must go wherever that service calls you oh villefort cried rene clasping her hands and looking towards her lover with piteous earnestness be merciful on this the day of our betrothal the young man passed round to the side of the table where the fair pleader sat and leaning over her chair said tenderly to give you pleasure my sweet rene i promise to show all the lenity in my power but if the charges brought against this bonapartist hero prove correct why then you really must give me leave to order his head to be cut off rene shuddered at the word cut for the growth in question had a head never mind that foolish girl villefort said the marquise she will soon get over these things so saying madame de saint-mran extended her dry bony hand to villefort who while imprinting a son-in-laws respectful salute on it looked at rene as much as to say i must try and fancy tis your dear hand i kiss as it should have been these are mournful auspices to accompany a betrothal sighed poor rene upon my word child exclaimed the angry marquise your folly exceeds all bounds i should be glad to know what connection there can possibly be between your sickly sentimentality and the affairs of the state oh mother murmured rene nay madame i pray you pardon this little traitor i promise you that to make up for her want of loyalty i will be most inflexibly severe then casting an expressive glance at his betrothed which seemed to say fear not for your dear sake my justice shall be tempered with mercy and receiving a sweet and approving smile in return villefort departed with paradise in his heart chapter the examination no sooner had villefort left the salon than he assumed the grave air of a man who holds the balance of life and death in his hands now in spite of the nobility of his countenance the command of which like a finished actor he had carefully studied before the glass it was by no means easy for him to assume an air of judicial severity except the recollection of the line of politics his father had adopted and which might interfere unless he acted with the greatest prudence with his own career grard de villefort was as happy as a man could be already rich he held a high official situation though only twenty-seven he was about to marry a young and charming woman whom he loved not passionately but reasonably as became a deputy attorney of the king and besides her personal attractions which were very great mademoiselle de saint-mrans family possessed considerable political influence which they would of course exert in his favor the dowry of his wife amounted to fifty thousand crowns and he had besides the prospect of seeing her fortune increased to half a million at her fathers death these considerations naturally gave villefort a feeling of such complete felicity that his mind was fairly dazzled in its contemplation at the door he met the commissary of police who was waiting for him the sight of this officer recalled villefort from the third heaven to earth he composed his face as we have before described and said i have read the letter sir and you have acted rightly in arresting this man now inform me what you
