during the six years that he had been imprisoned what might he not have accomplished this idea imparted new energy and in three days he had succeeded with the utmost precaution in removing the cement and exposing the stone-work the wall was built of rough stones among which to give strength to the structure blocks of hewn stone were at intervals imbedded it was one of these he had uncovered and which he must remove from its socket dants strove to do this with his nails but they were too weak the fragments of the jug broke and after an hour of useless toil dants paused with anguish on his brow was he to be thus stopped at the beginning and was he to wait inactive until his fellow workman had completed his task suddenly an idea occurred to him he smiled and the perspiration dried on his forehead the jailer always brought dants soup in an iron saucepan this saucepan contained soup for both prisoners for dants had noticed that it was either quite full or half empty according as the turnkey gave it to him or to his companion first the handle of this saucepan was of iron dants would have given ten years of his life in exchange for it m the jailer was accustomed to pour the contents of the saucepan into dants plate and dants after eating his soup with a wooden spoon washed the plate which thus served for every day now when evening came dants put his plate on the ground near the door the jailer as he entered stepped on it and broke it this time he could not blame dants he was wrong to leave it there but the jailer was wrong not to have looked before him the jailer therefore only grumbled then he looked about for something to pour the soup into dants entire dinner service consisted of one plate there was no alternative leave the saucepan said dants you can take it away when you bring me my breakfast this advice was to the jailers taste as it spared him the necessity of making another trip he left the saucepan dants was beside himself with joy he rapidly devoured his food and after waiting an hour lest the jailer should change his mind and return he removed his bed took the handle of the saucepan inserted the point between the hewn stone and rough stones of the wall and employed it as a lever a slight oscillation showed dants that all went well at the end of an hour the stone was extricated from the wall leaving a cavity a foot and a half in diameter dants carefully collected the plaster carried it into the corner of his cell and covered it with earth then wishing to make the best use of his time while he had the means of labor he continued to work without ceasing at the dawn of day he replaced the stone pushed his bed against the wall and lay down the breakfast consisted of a piece of bread the jailer entered and placed the bread on the table well dont you intend to bring me another plate said dants no replied the turnkey you destroy everything first you break your jug then you make me break your plate if all the prisoners followed your example the government would be ruined i shall leave you the saucepan and pour your soup into that so for the future i hope you will not be so destructive dants raised his eyes to heaven and clasped his hands beneath the coverlet he felt more gratitude for the possession of this piece of iron than he had ever felt for anything he had noticed however that the prisoner on the other side had ceased to labor no matter this was a greater reason for proceeding if his neighbor would not come to him he would go to his neighbor all day he toiled on untiringly and by the evening he had succeeded in extracting ten handfuls of plaster and fragments of stone when the hour for his jailers visit arrived dants straightened the handle of the saucepan as well as he could and placed it in its accustomed place the turnkey poured his ration of soup into it together with the fish for thrice a week the prisoners were deprived of meat this would have been a method of reckoning time had not dants long ceased to do so having poured out the soup the turnkey retired dants wished to ascertain whether his neighbor had really ceased to work he listened all was silent as it had been for the last three days dants sighed it was evident that his neighbor distrusted him however he toiled on all the night without being discouraged but after two or three hours he encountered an obstacle the iron made no impression but met with a smooth surface dants touched it and found that it was a beam this beam crossed or rather blocked up the hole dants had made it was necessary therefore to dig above or under it the unhappy young man had not thought of this oh my god my god murmured he i have so earnestly prayed to you that i hoped my prayers had been heard after having deprived me of my liberty after having deprived me of death
