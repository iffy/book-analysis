good abbs words however were wholly incomprehensible to him but like the aurora which guides the navigator in northern latitudes opened new vistas to the inquiring mind of the listener and gave fantastic glimpses of new horizons enabling him justly to estimate the delight an intellectual mind would have in following one so richly gifted as faria along the heights of truth where he was so much at home you must teach me a small part of what you know said dants if only to prevent your growing weary of me i can well believe that so learned a person as yourself would prefer absolute solitude to being tormented with the company of one as ignorant and uninformed as myself if you will only agree to my request i promise you never to mention another word about escaping the abb smiled alas my boy said he human knowledge is confined within very narrow limits and when i have taught you mathematics physics history and the three or four modern languages with which i am acquainted you will know as much as i do myself now it will scarcely require two years for me to communicate to you the stock of learning i possess two years exclaimed dants do you really believe i can acquire all these things in so short a time not their application certainly but their principles you may to learn is not to know there are the learners and the learned memory makes the one philosophy the other but cannot one learn philosophy philosophy cannot be taught it is the application of the sciences to truth it is like the golden cloud in which the messiah went up into heaven well then said dants what shall you teach me first i am in a hurry to begin i want to learn everything said the abb and that very evening the prisoners sketched a plan of education to be entered upon the following day dants possessed a prodigious memory combined with an astonishing quickness and readiness of conception the mathematical turn of his mind rendered him apt at all kinds of calculation while his naturally poetical feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality of arithmetical computation or the rigid severity of geometry he already knew italian and had also picked up a little of the romaic dialect during voyages to the east and by the aid of these two languages he easily comprehended the construction of all the others so that at the end of six months he began to speak spanish english and german in strict accordance with the promise made to the abb dants spoke no more of escape perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no room for such thoughts perhaps the recollection that he had pledged his word on which his sense of honor was keen kept him from referring in any way to the possibilities of flight days even months passed by unheeded in one rapid and instructive course at the end of a year dants was a new man dants observed however that faria in spite of the relief his society afforded daily grew sadder one thought seemed incessantly to harass and distract his mind sometimes he would fall into long reveries sigh heavily and involuntarily then suddenly rise and with folded arms begin pacing the confined space of his dungeon one day he stopped all at once and exclaimed ah if there were no sentinel there shall not be one a minute longer than you please said dants who had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as though his brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its minutest operations i have already told you answered the abb that i loathe the idea of shedding blood and yet the murder if you choose to call it so would be simply a measure of self-preservation no matter i could never agree to it still you have thought of it incessantly alas cried the abb and you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom have you not asked dants eagerly i have if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in the gallery beyond us he shall be both blind and deaf replied the young man with an air of determination that made his companion shudder no no cried the abb impossible dants endeavored to renew the subject the abb shook his head in token of disapproval and refused to make any further response three months passed away are you strong the abb asked one day of dants the young man in reply took up the chisel bent it into the form of a horseshoe and then as readily straightened it and will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry except as a last resort i promise on my honor then said the abb we may hope to put our design into execution and how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work at least a year and shall we begin at once at once we have lost a year to no purpose cried dants do you consider the last twelve months to have been wasted asked the abb forgive me cried edmond blushing deeply tut tut answered the abb man is but man after all and you are about the best specimen of the genus i
