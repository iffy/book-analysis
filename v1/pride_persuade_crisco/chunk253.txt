himself yes monsieur i am on the point of marrying a young girl i have been attached to for three years villefort impassive as he was was struck with this coincidence and the tremulous voice of dants surprised in the midst of his happiness struck a sympathetic chord in his own bosom he also was on the point of being married and he was summoned from his own happiness to destroy that of another this philosophic reflection thought he will make a great sensation at m de saint-mrans and he arranged mentally while dants awaited further questions the antithesis by which orators often create a reputation for eloquence when this speech was arranged villefort turned to dants m go on sir said he what would you have me say give all the information in your power tell me on which point you desire information and i will tell all i know only added he with a smile i warn you i know very little have you served under the usurper i was about to be mustered into the royal marines when he fell it is reported your political opinions are extreme said villefort who had never heard anything of the kind but was not sorry to make this inquiry as if it were an accusation my political opinions replied dants alas sir i never had any opinions i am hardly nineteen i know nothing i have no part to play if i obtain the situation i desire i shall owe it to m morrel thus all my opinions i will not say public but private are confined to these three sentiments i love my father i respect m morrel and i adore mercds this sir is all i can tell you and you see how uninteresting it is as dants spoke villefort gazed at his ingenuous and open countenance and recollected the words of rene who without knowing who the culprit was had besought his indulgence for him with the deputys knowledge of crime and criminals every word the young man uttered convinced him more and more of his innocence this lad for he was scarcely a man simple natural eloquent with that eloquence of the heart never found when sought for full of affection for everybody because he was happy and because happiness renders even the wicked good extended his affection even to his judge spite of villeforts severe look and stern accent dants seemed full of kindness pardieu said villefort he is a noble fellow i hope i shall gain renes favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on me i shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public and a sweet kiss in private full of this idea villeforts face became so joyous that when he turned to dants the latter who had watched the change on his physiognomy was smiling also sir said villefort have you any enemies at least that you know i have enemies replied dants my position is not sufficiently elevated for that as for my disposition that is perhaps somewhat too hasty but i have striven to repress it i have had ten or twelve sailors under me and if you question them they will tell you that they love and respect me not as a father for i am too young but as an elder brother but you may have excited jealousy you are about to become captain at nineteen an elevated post you are about to marry a pretty girl who loves you and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the envy of someone you are right you know men better than i do and what you say may possibly be the case i confess but if such persons are among my acquaintances i prefer not to know it because then i should be forced to hate them you are wrong you should always strive to see clearly around you you seem a worthy young man i will depart from the strict line of my duty to aid you in discovering the author of this accusation here is the paper do you know the writing as he spoke villefort drew the letter from his pocket and presented it to dants dants read it a cloud passed over his brow as he said no monsieur i do not know the writing and yet it is tolerably plain whoever did it writes well i am very fortunate added he looking gratefully at villefort to be examined by such a man as you for this envious person is a real enemy and by the rapid glance that the young mans eyes shot forth villefort saw how much energy lay hid beneath this mildness now said the deputy answer me frankly not as a prisoner to a judge but as one man to another who takes an interest in him what truth is there in the accusation contained in this anonymous letter and villefort threw disdainfully on his desk the letter dants had just given back to him none at all i will tell you the real facts i swear by my honor as a sailor by my love for mercds by the life of my father speak monsieur said villefort then internally if rene could see me i hope she would be satisfied and would no longer call me a decapitator well when we quitted naples
