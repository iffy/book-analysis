the latter had given him that he might on his return at any hour of the day or night gain access to the presence even in the harem unfortunately the negotiation failed and when he returned to defend his benefactor he was dead but said the count so great was ali pashas confidence that on his death-bed he resigned his favorite mistress and her daughter to my care albert started on hearing these words the history of hayde recurred to him and he remembered what she had said of that message and the ring and the manner in which she had been sold and made a slave and what effect did this discourse produce anxiously inquired albert i acknowledge it affected me and indeed all the committee also said beauchamp meanwhile the president carelessly opened the letter which had been brought to him but the first lines aroused his attention he read them again and again and fixing his eyes on m de morcerf count said he you have said that the vizier of yanina confided his wife and daughter to your care yes sir replied morcerf but in that like all the rest misfortune pursued me on my return vasiliki and her daughter hayde had disappeared did you know them my intimacy with the pasha and his unlimited confidence had gained me an introduction to them and i had seen them above twenty times have you any idea what became of them yes sir i heard they had fallen victims to their sorrow and perhaps to their poverty i was not rich my life was in constant danger i could not seek them to my great regret the president frowned imperceptibly gentlemen said he you have heard the comte de morcerfs defence can you sir produce any witnesses to the truth of what you have asserted alas no monsieur replied the count all those who surrounded the vizier or who knew me at his court are either dead or gone away i know not where i believe that i alone of all my countrymen survived that dreadful war i have only the letters of ali tepelini which i have placed before you the ring a token of his good-will which is here and lastly the most convincing proof i can offer after an anonymous attack and that is the absence of any witness against my veracity and the purity of my military life a murmur of approbation ran through the assembly and at this moment albert had nothing more transpired your fathers cause had been gained it only remained to put it to the vote when the president resumed gentlemen and you monsieur you will not be displeased i presume to listen to one who calls himself a very important witness and who has just presented himself he is doubtless come to prove the perfect innocence of our colleague here is a letter i have just received on the subject shall it be read or shall it be passed over and shall we take no notice of this incident m de morcerf turned pale and clenched his hands on the papers he held the committee decided to hear the letter the count was thoughtful and silent the president read mr president i can furnish the committee of inquiry into the conduct of the lieutenant-general the count of morcerf in epirus and in macedonia with important particulars the president paused and the count turned pale the president looked at his auditors proceed was heard on all sides the president resumed i was on the spot at the death of ali pasha i was present during his last moments i know what is become of vasiliki and hayde i am at the command of the committee and even claim the honor of being heard i shall be in the lobby when this note is delivered to you and who is this witness or rather this enemy asked the count in a tone in which there was a visible alteration we shall know sir replied the president is the committee willing to hear this witness yes yes they all said at once the door-keeper was called is there anyone in the lobby said the president yes sir who is it a woman accompanied by a servant everyone looked at his neighbor bring her in said the president five minutes after the door-keeper again appeared all eyes were fixed on the door and i said beauchamp shared the general expectation and anxiety behind the door-keeper walked a woman enveloped in a large veil which completely concealed her it was evident from her figure and the perfumes she had about her that she was young and fastidious in her tastes but that was all the president requested her to throw aside her veil and it was then seen that she was dressed in the grecian costume and was remarkably beautiful ah said albert it was she who hayde who told you that alas i guess it but go on beauchamp you see i am calm and strong and yet we must be drawing near the disclosure m de morcerf continued beauchamp looked at this woman with surprise and terror her lips were about to pass his sentence of life or death to the committee the adventure was so extraordinary and curious that the interest they had felt for the counts safety became now quite a secondary
