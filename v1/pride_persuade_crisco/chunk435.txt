cristo it was an embarrassing load for a man seeking to escape i had not for a moment the idea of keeping it but i knew that at paris there was an asylum where they receive such creatures as i passed the city gates i declared that i had found the child on the road and i inquired where the asylum was the box confirmed my statement the linen proved that the infant belonged to wealthy parents the blood with which i was covered might have proceeded from the child as well as from anyone else no objection was raised but they pointed out the asylum which was situated at the upper end of the rue denfer and after having taken the precaution of cutting the linen in two pieces so that one of the two letters which marked it was on the piece wrapped around the child while the other remained in my possession i rang the bell and fled with all speed a fortnight after i was at rogliano and i said to assunta console thyself sister israel is dead but he is avenged she demanded what i meant and when i had told her all giovanni said she you should have brought this child with you we would have replaced the parents it has lost have called it benedetto and then in consequence of this good action god would have blessed us in reply i gave her the half of the linen i had kept in order to reclaim him if we became rich what letters were marked on the linen said monte cristo an h and an n surmounted by a barons coronet by heaven m bertuccio you make use of heraldic terms where did you study heraldry in your service excellency where everything is learned go on i am curious to know two things what are they your excellency what became of this little boy for i think you told me it was a boy m bertuccio no excellency i do not recollect telling you that i thought you did i must have been mistaken no you were not for it was in reality a little boy but your excellency wished to know two things what was the second the second was the crime of which you were accused when you asked for a confessor and the abb busoni came to visit you at your request in the prison at nmes the story will be very long excellency what matter you know i take but little sleep and i do not suppose you are very much inclined for it either bertuccio bowed and resumed his story partly to drown the recollections of the past that haunted me partly to supply the wants of the poor widow i eagerly returned to my trade of smuggler which had become more easy since that relaxation of the laws which always follows a revolution the southern districts were ill-watched in particular in consequence of the disturbances that were perpetually breaking out in avignon nmes or uzs we profited by this respite on the part of the government to make friends everywhere since my brothers assassination in the streets of nmes i had never entered the town the result was that the innkeeper with whom we were connected seeing that we would no longer come to him was forced to come to us and had established a branch to his inn on the road from bellegarde to beaucaire at the sign of the pont du gard we had thus at aigues-mortes martigues or bouc a dozen places where we left our goods and where in case of necessity we concealed ourselves from the gendarmes and custom-house officers smuggling is a profitable trade when a certain degree of vigor and intelligence is employed as for myself brought up in the mountains i had a double motive for fearing the gendarmes and custom-house officers as my appearance before the judges would cause an inquiry and an inquiry always looks back into the past and in my past life they might find something far more grave than the selling of smuggled cigars or barrels of brandy without a permit so preferring death to capture i accomplished the most astonishing deeds and which more than once showed me that the too great care we take of our bodies is the only obstacle to the success of those projects which require rapid decision and vigorous and determined execution in reality when you have once devoted your life to your enterprises you are no longer the equal of other men or rather other men are no longer your equals and whosoever has taken this resolution feels his strength and resources doubled philosophy m bertuccio interrupted the count you have done a little of everything in your life oh excellency no no but philosophy at half-past ten at night is somewhat late yet i have no other observation to make for what you say is correct which is more than can be said for all philosophy my journeys became more and more extensive and more productive assunta took care of all and our little fortune increased one day as i was setting off on an expedition go said she at your return i will give you a surprise i questioned her but in vain she would tell me nothing and i departed our expedition lasted nearly six weeks we
