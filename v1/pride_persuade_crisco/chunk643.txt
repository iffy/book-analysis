and chteau-renaud remained alone albert looked at his two friends not timidly but in a way that appeared to ask their opinion of what he had just done indeed my dear friend said beauchamp first who had either the most feeling or the least dissimulation allow me to congratulate you this is a very unhoped-for conclusion of a very disagreeable affair albert remained silent and wrapped in thought chteau-renaud contented himself with tapping his boot with his flexible cane are we not going said he after this embarrassing silence when you please replied beauchamp allow me only to compliment m de morcerf who has given proof today of rare chivalric generosity oh yes said chteau-renaud it is magnificent continued beauchamp to be able to exercise so much self-control assuredly as for me i should have been incapable of it said chteau-renaud with most significant coolness gentlemen interrupted albert i think you did not understand that something very serious had passed between m de monte cristo and myself possibly possibly said beauchamp immediately but every simpleton would not be able to understand your heroism and sooner or later you will find yourself compelled to explain it to them more energetically than would be convenient to your bodily health and the duration of your life may i give you a friendly counsel set out for naples the hague or st petersburg calm countries where the point of honor is better understood than among our hot-headed parisians seek quietude and oblivion so that you may return peaceably to france after a few years am i not right m de chteau-renaud m that is quite my opinion said the gentleman nothing induces serious duels so much as a duel forsworn thank you gentlemen replied albert with a smile of indifference i shall follow your advice not because you give it but because i had before intended to quit france i thank you equally for the service you have rendered me in being my seconds it is deeply engraved on my heart and after what you have just said i remember that only chteau-renaud and beauchamp looked at each other the impression was the same on both of them and the tone in which morcerf had just expressed his thanks was so determined that the position would have become embarrassing for all if the conversation had continued good-bye albert said beauchamp suddenly carelessly extending his hand to the young man the latter did not appear to arouse from his lethargy in fact he did not notice the offered hand good-bye said chteau-renaud in his turn keeping his little cane in his left hand and saluting with his right alberts lips scarcely whispered good-bye but his look was more explicit it expressed a whole poem of restrained anger proud disdain and generous indignation he preserved his melancholy and motionless position for some time after his two friends had regained their carriage then suddenly unfastening his horse from the little tree to which his servant had tied it he mounted and galloped off in the direction of paris in a quarter of an hour he was entering the house in the rue du helder as he alighted he thought he saw his fathers pale face behind the curtain of the counts bedroom albert turned away his head with a sigh and went to his own apartments he cast one lingering look on all the luxuries which had rendered life so easy and so happy since his infancy he looked at the pictures whose faces seemed to smile and the landscapes which appeared painted in brighter colors then he took away his mothers portrait with its oaken frame leaving the gilt frame from which he took it black and empty then he arranged all his beautiful turkish arms his fine english guns his japanese china his cups mounted in silver his artistic bronzes by feuchres or barye examined the cupboards and placed the key in each threw into a drawer of his secretaire which he left open all the pocket-money he had about him and with it the thousand fancy jewels from his vases and his jewel-boxes then he made an exact inventory of everything and placed it in the most conspicuous part of the table after putting aside the books and papers which had collected there at the beginning of this work his servant notwithstanding orders to the contrary came to his room what do you want asked he with a more sorrowful than angry tone pardon me sir replied the valet you had forbidden me to disturb you but the count of morcerf has called me well said albert i did not like to go to him without first seeing you why because the count is doubtless aware that i accompanied you to the meeting this morning m it is probable said albert and since he has sent for me it is doubtless to question me on what happened there what must i answer the truth then i shall say the duel did not take place you will say i apologized to the count of monte cristo go the valet bowed and retired and albert returned to his inventory as he was finishing this work the sound of horses prancing in the yard and the wheels of a carriage shaking his window attracted his attention he approached the window and saw his father get into it and drive
