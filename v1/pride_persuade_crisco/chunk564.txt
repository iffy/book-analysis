the misfortune he feared morrel gained the edge of the clump of trees and was going to pass as quickly as possible through the flower-garden when the sound of a voice still at some distance but which was borne upon the wind reached him at this sound as he was already partially exposed to view he stepped back and concealed himself completely remaining perfectly motionless he had formed his resolution if it was valentine alone he would speak as she passed if she was accompanied and he could not speak still he should see her and know that she was safe if they were strangers he would listen to their conversation and might understand something of this hitherto incomprehensible mystery the moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had concealed it and morrel saw villefort come out upon the steps followed by a gentleman in black they descended and advanced towards the clump of trees and morrel soon recognized the other gentleman as doctor davrigny m the young man seeing them approach drew back mechanically until he found himself stopped by a sycamore-tree in the centre of the clump there he was compelled to remain soon the two gentlemen stopped also ah my dear doctor said the procureur heaven declares itself against my house what a dreadful death what a blow seek not to console me alas nothing can alleviate so great a sorrow the wound is too deep and too fresh dead dead the cold sweat sprang to the young mans brow and his teeth chattered who could be dead in that house which villefort himself had called accursed my dear m de villefort replied the doctor with a tone which redoubled the terror of the young man i have not led you here to console you on the contrary what can you mean asked the procureur alarmed i mean that behind the misfortune which has just happened to you there is another perhaps still greater can it be possible murmured villefort clasping his hands what are you going to tell me are we quite alone my friend yes quite but why all these precautions because i have a terrible secret to communicate to you said the doctor let us sit down villefort fell rather than seated himself the doctor stood before him with one hand placed on his shoulder morrel horrified supported his head with one hand and with the other pressed his heart lest its beatings should be heard dead dead repeated he within himself and he felt as if he were also dying speak doctor i am listening said villefort strike i am prepared for everything madame de saint-mran was doubtless advancing in years but she enjoyed excellent health morrel began again to breathe freely which he had not done during the last ten minutes grief has consumed her said villefort yes grief doctor after living forty years with the marquis it is not grief my dear villefort said the doctor grief may kill although it rarely does and never in a day never in an hour never in ten minutes villefort answered nothing he simply raised his head which had been cast down before and looked at the doctor with amazement were you present during the last struggle asked m davrigny i was replied the procureur you begged me not to leave did you notice the symptoms of the disease to which madame de saint-mran has fallen a victim i did madame de saint-mran had three successive attacks at intervals of some minutes each one more serious than the former when you arrived madame de saint-mran had already been panting for breath some minutes she then had a fit which i took to be simply a nervous attack and it was only when i saw her raise herself in the bed and her limbs and neck appear stiffened that i became really alarmed then i understood from your countenance there was more to fear than i had thought this crisis past i endeavored to catch your eye but could not you held her hand you were feeling her pulse and the second fit came on before you had turned towards me this was more terrible than the first the same nervous movements were repeated and the mouth contracted and turned purple and at the third she expired at the end of the first attack i discovered symptoms of tetanus you confirmed my opinion yes before others replied the doctor but now we are alone what are you going to say oh spare me that the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances are the same m de villefort started from his seat then in a moment fell down again silent and motionless morrel knew not if he were dreaming or awake listen said the doctor i know the full importance of the statement i have just made and the disposition of the man to whom i have made it do you speak to me as a magistrate or as a friend asked villefort as a friend and only as a friend at this moment the similarity in the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances is so great that were i obliged to affirm by oath what i have now stated i should hesitate i therefore repeat to you i speak not to a magistrate but to a friend and to that
