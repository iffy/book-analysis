franz gravely and in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced by the countesss visiting the colosseum as we did last night by moonlight and nearly alone you were with her then i was and what did you say to her oh we talked of the illustrious dead of whom that magnificent ruin is a glorious monument upon my word cried albert you must have been a very entertaining companion alone or all but alone with a beautiful woman in such a place of sentiment as the colosseum and yet to find nothing better to talk about than the dead all i can say is if ever i should get such a chance the living should be my theme m and you will probably find your theme ill-chosen but said albert breaking in upon his discourse never mind the past let us only remember the present are you not going to keep your promise of introducing me to the fair subject of our remarks certainly directly the curtain falls on the stage what a confounded long time this first act lasts i believe on my soul that they never mean to finish it oh yes they will only listen to that charming finale how exquisitely coselli sings his part but what an awkward inelegant fellow he is well then what do you say to la specchia did you ever see anything more perfect than her acting why you know my dear fellow when one has been accustomed to malibran and sontag such singers as these dont make the same impression on you they perhaps do on others at least you must admire morianis style and execution i never fancied men of his dark ponderous appearance singing with a voice like a womans my good friend said franz turning to him while albert continued to point his glass at every box in the theatre you seem determined not to approve you are really too difficult to please the curtain at length fell on the performances to the infinite satisfaction of the viscount of morcerf who seized his hat rapidly passed his fingers through his hair arranged his cravat and wristbands and signified to franz that he was waiting for him to lead the way franz who had mutely interrogated the countess and received from her a gracious smile in token that he would be welcome sought not to retard the gratification of alberts eager impatience but began at once the tour of the house closely followed by albert who availed himself of the few minutes required to reach the opposite side of the theatre to settle the height and smoothness of his collar and to arrange the lappets of his coat this important task was just completed as they arrived at the countesss box at the knock the door was immediately opened and the young man who was seated beside the countess in obedience to the italian custom instantly rose and surrendered his place to the strangers who in turn would be expected to retire upon the arrival of other visitors franz presented albert as one of the most distinguished young men of the day both as regarded his position in society and extraordinary talents nor did he say more than the truth for in paris and the circle in which the viscount moved he was looked upon and cited as a model of perfection franz added that his companion deeply grieved at having been prevented the honor of being presented to the countess during her sojourn in paris was most anxious to make up for it and had requested him franz to remedy the past misfortune by conducting him to her box and concluded by asking pardon for his presumption in having taken it upon himself to do so the countess in reply bowed gracefully to albert and extended her hand with cordial kindness to franz then inviting albert to take the vacant seat beside her she recommended franz to take the next best if he wished to view the ballet and pointed to the one behind her own chair albert was soon deeply engrossed in discoursing upon paris and parisian matters speaking to the countess of the various persons they both knew there franz perceived how completely he was in his element and unwilling to interfere with the pleasure he so evidently felt took up alberts glass and began in his turn to survey the audience sitting alone in the front of a box immediately opposite but situated on the third row was a woman of exquisite beauty dressed in a greek costume which evidently from the ease and grace with which she wore it was her national attire behind her but in deep shadow was the outline of a masculine figure but the features of this latter personage it was not possible to distinguish franz could not forbear breaking in upon the apparently interesting conversation passing between the countess and albert to inquire of the former if she knew who was the fair albanian opposite since beauty such as hers was well worthy of being observed by either sex all i can tell about her replied the countess is that she has been at rome since the beginning of the season for i saw her where she now sits the very first night of the season and since then she has never missed a performance sometimes she is
