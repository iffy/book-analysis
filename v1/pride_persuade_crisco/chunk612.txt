confinement could distinguish in the darkness the slightest movement of the trees the little light in the lodge had long been extinct it might be expected that the attack if indeed an attack was projected would be made from the staircase of the ground floor and not from a window in monte cristos opinion the villains sought his life not his money it would be his bedroom they would attack and they must reach it by the back staircase or by the window in the dressing-room the clock of the invalides struck a quarter to twelve the west wind bore on its moistened gusts the doleful vibration of the three strokes m as the last stroke died away the count thought he heard a slight noise in the dressing-room this first sound or rather this first grinding was followed by a second then a third at the fourth the count knew what to expect a firm and well-practised hand was engaged in cutting the four sides of a pane of glass with a diamond the count felt his heart beat more rapidly inured as men may be to danger forewarned as they may be of peril they understand by the fluttering of the heart and the shuddering of the frame the enormous difference between a dream and a reality between the project and the execution however monte cristo only made a sign to apprise ali who understanding that danger was approaching from the other side drew nearer to his master monte cristo was eager to ascertain the strength and number of his enemies the window whence the noise proceeded was opposite the opening by which the count could see into the dressing-room he fixed his eyes on that window he distinguished a shadow in the darkness then one of the panes became quite opaque as if a sheet of paper were stuck on the outside then the square cracked without falling through the opening an arm was passed to find the fastening then a second the window turned on its hinges and a man entered he was alone thats a daring rascal whispered the count at that moment ali touched him slightly on the shoulder he turned ali pointed to the window of the room in which they were facing the street i see said he there are two of them one does the work while the other stands guard he made a sign to ali not to lose sight of the man in the street and turned to the one in the dressing-room the glass-cutter had entered and was feeling his way his arms stretched out before him at last he appeared to have made himself familiar with his surroundings there were two doors he bolted them both when he drew near to the bedroom door monte cristo expected that he was coming in and raised one of his pistols but he simply heard the sound of the bolts sliding in their copper rings it was only a precaution the nocturnal visitor ignorant of the fact that the count had removed the staples might now think himself at home and pursue his purpose with full security alone and free to act as he wished the man then drew from his pocket something which the count could not discern placed it on a stand then went straight to the secretaire felt the lock and contrary to his expectation found that the key was missing but the glass-cutter was a prudent man who had provided for all emergencies the count soon heard the rattling of a bunch of skeleton keys such as the locksmith brings when called to force a lock and which thieves call nightingales doubtless from the music of their nightly song when they grind against the bolt ah ha whispered monte cristo with a smile of disappointment he is only a thief but the man in the dark could not find the right key he reached the instrument he had placed on the stand touched a spring and immediately a pale light just bright enough to render objects distinct was reflected on his hands and countenance by heavens exclaimed monte cristo starting back it is ali raised his hatchet dont stir whispered monte cristo and put down your hatchet we shall require no arms m then he added some words in a low tone for the exclamation which surprise had drawn from the count faint as it had been had startled the man who remained in the pose of the old knife-grinder it was an order the count had just given for immediately ali went noiselessly and returned bearing a black dress and a three-cornered hat meanwhile monte cristo had rapidly taken off his greatcoat waistcoat and shirt and one might distinguish by the glimmering through the open panel that he wore a pliant tunic of steel mail of which the last in france where daggers are no longer dreaded was worn by king louis xvi who feared the dagger at his breast and whose head was cleft with a hatchet the tunic soon disappeared under a long cassock as did his hair under a priests wig the three-cornered hat over this effectually transformed the count into an abb the man hearing nothing more stood erect and while monte cristo was completing his disguise had advanced straight to the secretaire whose lock was beginning to crack under his nightingale try
