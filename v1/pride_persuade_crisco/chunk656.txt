at the end of the faubourg saw with surprise that carpenters and masons were occupied in repairing the lower part of the tottering house chapter father and daughter we saw in a preceding chapter how madame danglars went formally to announce to madame de villefort the approaching marriage of eugnie danglars and m andrea cavalcanti this formal announcement which implied or appeared to imply the approval of all the persons concerned in this momentous affair had been preceded by a scene to which our readers must be admitted we beg them to take one step backward and to transport themselves the morning of that day of great catastrophes into the showy gilded salon we have before shown them and which was the pride of its owner baron danglars in this room at about ten oclock in the morning the banker himself had been walking to and fro for some minutes thoughtfully and in evident uneasiness watching both doors and listening to every sound when his patience was exhausted he called his valet tienne said he see why mademoiselle eugnie has asked me to meet her in the drawing-room and why she makes me wait so long having given this vent to his ill-humor the baron became more calm mademoiselle danglars had that morning requested an interview with her father and had fixed on the gilded drawing-room as the spot the singularity of this step and above all its formality had not a little surprised the banker who had immediately obeyed his daughter by repairing first to the drawing-room tienne soon returned from his errand mademoiselles ladys maid says sir that mademoiselle is finishing her toilette and will be here shortly danglars nodded to signify that he was satisfied to the world and to his servants danglars assumed the character of the good-natured man and the indulgent father this was one of his parts in the popular comedy he was performing a make-up he had adopted and which suited him about as well as the masks worn on the classic stage by paternal actors who seen from one side were the image of geniality and from the other showed lips drawn down in chronic ill-temper let us hasten to say that in private the genial side descended to the level of the other so that generally the indulgent man disappeared to give place to the brutal husband and domineering father why the devil does that foolish girl who pretends to wish to speak to me not come into my study and why on earth does she want to speak to me at all he was turning this thought over in his brain for the twentieth time when the door opened and eugnie appeared attired in a figured black satin dress her hair dressed and gloves on as if she were going to the italian opera well eugnie what is it you want with me and why in this solemn drawing-room when the study is so comfortable i quite understand why you ask sir said eugnie making a sign that her father might be seated and in fact your two questions suggest fully the theme of our conversation i will answer them both and contrary to the usual method the last first because it is the least difficult i have chosen the drawing-room sir as our place of meeting in order to avoid the disagreeable impressions and influences of a bankers study those gilded cashbooks drawers locked like gates of fortresses heaps of bank-bills come from i know not where and the quantities of letters from england holland spain india china and peru have generally a strange influence on a fathers mind and make him forget that there is in the world an interest greater and more sacred than the good opinion of his correspondents i have therefore chosen this drawing-room where you see smiling and happy in their magnificent frames your portrait mine my mothers and all sorts of rural landscapes and touching pastorals i rely much on external impressions perhaps with regard to you they are immaterial but i should be no artist if i had not some fancies very well replied m danglars who had listened to all this preamble with imperturbable coolness but without understanding a word since like every man burdened with thoughts of the past he was occupied with seeking the thread of his own ideas in those of the speaker there is then the second point cleared up or nearly so said eugnie without the least confusion and with that masculine pointedness which distinguished her gesture and her language and you appear satisfied with the explanation now let us return to the first you ask me why i have requested this interview i will tell you in two words sir i will not marry count andrea cavalcanti danglars leaped from his chair and raised his eyes and arms towards heaven m yes indeed sir continued eugnie still quite calm you are astonished i see for since this little affair began i have not manifested the slightest opposition and yet i am always sure when the opportunity arrives to oppose a determined and absolute will to people who have not consulted me and things which displease me however this time my tranquillity or passiveness as philosophers say proceeded from another source it proceeded from a wish like a submissive and devoted daughter a slight smile was observable on
