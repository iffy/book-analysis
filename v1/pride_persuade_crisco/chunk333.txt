sir replied caderousse they had made me drink to such an excess that i nearly lost all perception i had only an indistinct understanding of what was passing around me i said all that a man in such a state could say but they both assured me that it was a jest they were carrying on and perfectly harmless next day next day sir you must have seen plain enough what they had been doing yet you said nothing though you were present when dants was arrested yes sir i was there and very anxious to speak but danglars restrained me if he should really be guilty said he and did really put in to the island of elba if he is really charged with a letter for the bonapartist committee at paris and if they find this letter upon him those who have supported him will pass for his accomplices i confess i had my fears in the state in which politics then were and i held my tongue it was cowardly i confess but it was not criminal m i understand you allowed matters to take their course that was all yes sir answered caderousse and remorse preys on me night and day i often ask pardon of god i swear to you because this action the only one with which i have seriously to reproach myself in all my life is no doubt the cause of my abject condition i am expiating a moment of selfishness and so i always say to la carconte when she complains hold your tongue woman it is the will of god and caderousse bowed his head with every sign of real repentance well sir said the abb you have spoken unreservedly and thus to accuse yourself is to deserve pardon unfortunately edmond is dead and has not pardoned me he did not know said the abb but he knows it all now interrupted caderousse they say the dead know everything there was a brief silence the abb rose and paced up and down pensively and then resumed his seat you have two or three times mentioned a m morrel he said who was he the owner of the pharaon and patron of dants and what part did he play in this sad drama inquired the abb the part of an honest man full of courage and real regard twenty times he interceded for edmond when the emperor returned he wrote implored threatened and so energetically that on the second restoration he was persecuted as a bonapartist ten times as i told you he came to see dants father and offered to receive him in his own house and the night or two before his death as i have already said he left his purse on the mantelpiece with which they paid the old mans debts and buried him decently and so edmonds father died as he had lived without doing harm to anyone i have the purse still by me a large one made of red silk and asked the abb is m morrel still alive yes replied caderousse in that case replied the abb he should be a man blessed of god rich happy caderousse smiled bitterly yes happy as myself said he what m morrel unhappy exclaimed the abb he is reduced almost to the last extremity nay he is almost at the point of dishonor how yes continued caderousse so it is after five-and-twenty years of labor after having acquired a most honorable name in the trade of marseilles m morrel is utterly ruined he has lost five ships in two years has suffered by the bankruptcy of three large houses and his only hope now is in that very pharaon which poor dants commanded and which is expected from the indies with a cargo of cochineal and indigo if this ship founders like the others he is a ruined man and has the unfortunate man wife or children inquired the abb yes he has a wife who through everything has behaved like an angel he has a daughter who was about to marry the man she loved but whose family now will not allow him to wed the daughter of a ruined man he has besides a son a lieutenant in the army and as you may suppose all this instead of lessening only augments his sorrows if he were alone in the world he would blow out his brains and there would be an end horrible ejaculated the priest and it is thus heaven recompenses virtue sir added caderousse you see i who never did a bad action but that i have told you of am in destitution with my poor wife dying of fever before my very eyes and i unable to do anything in the world for her i shall die of hunger as old dants did while fernand and danglars are rolling in wealth how is that because their deeds have brought them good fortune while honest men have been reduced to misery what has become of danglars the instigator and therefore the most guilty what has become of him why he left marseilles and was taken on the recommendation of m morrel who did not know his crime as cashier into a spanish bank during the war with spain he was employed in the commissariat of the french army and made a fortune then
