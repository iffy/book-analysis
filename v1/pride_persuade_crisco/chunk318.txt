note the leaves of the myrtle and olive trees waved and rustled in the wind at every step that edmond took he disturbed the lizards glittering with the hues of the emerald afar off he saw the wild goats bounding from crag to crag in a word the island was inhabited yet edmond felt himself alone guided by the hand of god he felt an indescribable sensation somewhat akin to dread that dread of the daylight which even in the desert makes us fear we are watched and observed this feeling was so strong that at the moment when edmond was about to begin his labor he stopped laid down his pickaxe seized his gun mounted to the summit of the highest rock and from thence gazed round in every direction but it was not upon corsica the very houses of which he could distinguish or on sardinia or on the island of elba with its historical associations or upon the almost imperceptible line that to the experienced eye of a sailor alone revealed the coast of genoa the proud and leghorn the commercial that he gazed it was at the brigantine that had left in the morning and the tartan that had just set sail that edmond fixed his eyes the first was just disappearing in the straits of bonifacio the other following an opposite direction was about to round the island of corsica this sight reassured him he then looked at the objects near him he saw that he was on the highest point of the island a statue on this vast pedestal of granite nothing human appearing in sight while the blue ocean beat against the base of the island and covered it with a fringe of foam then he descended with cautious and slow step for he dreaded lest an accident similar to that he had so adroitly feigned should happen in reality dants as we have said had traced the marks along the rocks and he had noticed that they led to a small creek which was hidden like the bath of some ancient nymph this creek was sufficiently wide at its mouth and deep in the centre to admit of the entrance of a small vessel of the lugger class which would be perfectly concealed from observation then following the clew that in the hands of the abb faria had been so skilfully used to guide him through the ddalian labyrinth of probabilities he thought that the cardinal spada anxious not to be watched had entered the creek concealed his little barque followed the line marked by the notches in the rock and at the end of it had buried his treasure it was this idea that had brought dants back to the circular rock one thing only perplexed edmond and destroyed his theory how could this rock which weighed several tons have been lifted to this spot without the aid of many men suddenly an idea flashed across his mind instead of raising it thought he they have lowered it and he sprang from the rock in order to inspect the base on which it had formerly stood he soon perceived that a slope had been formed and the rock had slid along this until it stopped at the spot it now occupied a large stone had served as a wedge flints and pebbles had been inserted around it so as to conceal the orifice this species of masonry had been covered with earth and grass and weeds had grown there moss had clung to the stones myrtle-bushes had taken root and the old rock seemed fixed to the earth m dants dug away the earth carefully and detected or fancied he detected the ingenious artifice he attacked this wall cemented by the hand of time with his pickaxe after ten minutes labor the wall gave way and a hole large enough to insert the arm was opened dants went and cut the strongest olive-tree he could find stripped off its branches inserted it in the hole and used it as a lever but the rock was too heavy and too firmly wedged to be moved by anyone man were he hercules himself dants saw that he must attack the wedge but how he cast his eyes around and saw the horn full of powder which his friend jacopo had left him he smiled the infernal invention would serve him for this purpose with the aid of his pickaxe dants after the manner of a labor-saving pioneer dug a mine between the upper rock and the one that supported it filled it with powder then made a match by rolling his handkerchief in saltpetre he lighted it and retired the explosion soon followed the upper rock was lifted from its base by the terrific force of the powder the lower one flew into pieces thousands of insects escaped from the aperture dants had previously formed and a huge snake like the guardian demon of the treasure rolled himself along in darkening coils and disappeared dants approached the upper rock which now without any support leaned towards the sea the intrepid treasure-seeker walked round it and selecting the spot from whence it appeared most susceptible to attack placed his lever in one of the crevices and strained every nerve to move the mass the rock already shaken by the explosion tottered on its base dants redoubled
