fiesole count and her name was do you desire to know her name oh said monte cristo it would be quite superfluous for you to tell me for i already know it the count knows everything said the italian bowing oliva corsinari was it not oliva corsinari a marchioness a marchioness and you married her at last notwithstanding the opposition of her family yes that was the way it ended and you have doubtless brought all your papers with you said monte cristo what papers the certificate of your marriage with oliva corsinari and the register of your childs birth the register of my childs birth the register of the birth of andrea cavalcanti of your son is not his name andrea i believe so said the major what you believe so i dare not positively assert it as he has been lost for so long a time well then said monte cristo you have all the documents with you your excellency i regret to say that not knowing it was necessary to come provided with these papers i neglected to bring them that is unfortunate returned monte cristo were they then so necessary they were indispensable the major passed his hand across his brow ah perbacco indispensable were they certainly they were supposing there were to be doubts raised as to the validity of your marriage or the legitimacy of your child true said the major there might be doubts raised in that case your son would be very unpleasantly situated it would be fatal to his interests it might cause him to fail in some desirable matrimonial alliance o peccato you must know that in france they are very particular on these points it is not sufficient as in italy to go to the priest and say we love each other and want you to marry us marriage is a civil affair in france and in order to marry in an orthodox manner you must have papers which undeniably establish your identity that is the misfortune you see i have not these necessary papers fortunately i have them though said monte cristo you yes you have them i have them ah indeed said the major who seeing the object of his journey frustrated by the absence of the papers feared also that his forgetfulness might give rise to some difficulty concerning the francs ah indeed that is a fortunate circumstance yes that really is lucky for it never occurred to me to bring them i do not at all wonder at it one cannot think of everything but happily the abb busoni thought for you he is an excellent person he is extremely prudent and thoughtful he is an admirable man said the major and he sent them to you here they are the major clasped his hands in token of admiration you married oliva corsinari in the church of san paolo del monte-cattini here is the priests certificate yes indeed there it is truly said the italian looking on with astonishment and here is andrea cavalcantis baptismal register given by the cur of saravezza all quite correct take these documents then they do not concern me you will give them to your son who will of course take great care of them i should think so indeed if he were to lose them well and if he were to lose them said monte cristo in that case replied the major it would be necessary to write to the cur for duplicates and it would be some time before they could be obtained it would be a difficult matter to arrange said monte cristo almost an impossibility replied the major i am very glad to see that you understand the value of these papers i regard them as invaluable now said monte cristo as to the mother of the young man as to the mother of the young man repeated the italian with anxiety as regards the marchesa corsinari really said the major difficulties seem to thicken upon us will she be wanted in any way no sir replied monte cristo besides has she not yes sir said the major she has m paid the last debt of nature alas yes returned the italian i knew that said monte cristo she has been dead these ten years and i am still mourning her loss exclaimed the major drawing from his pocket a checked handkerchief and alternately wiping first the left and then the right eye what would you have said monte cristo we are all mortal now you understand my dear monsieur cavalcanti that it is useless for you to tell people in france that you have been separated from your son for fifteen years stories of gypsies who steal children are not at all in vogue in this part of the world and would not be believed you sent him for his education to a college in one of the provinces and now you wish him to complete his education in the parisian world that is the reason which has induced you to leave via reggio where you have lived since the death of your wife that will be sufficient you think so certainly very well then if they should hear of the separation ah yes what could i say that an unfaithful tutor bought over by the enemies of your family by the corsinari precisely had stolen away
