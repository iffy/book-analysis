hands lighted tapers appeared first the chief marched at the head m behind the penitents came a man of vast stature and proportions he was naked with the exception of cloth drawers at the left side of which hung a large knife in a sheath and he bore on his right shoulder a heavy iron sledge-hammer this man was the executioner he had moreover sandals bound on his feet by cords behind the executioner came in the order in which they were to die first peppino and then andrea each was accompanied by two priests neither had his eyes bandaged peppino walked with a firm step doubtless aware of what awaited him andrea was supported by two priests each of them from time to time kissed the crucifix a confessor held out to them at this sight alone franz felt his legs tremble under him he looked at albert he was as white as his shirt and mechanically cast away his cigar although he had not half smoked it the count alone seemed unmoved nay more a slight color seemed striving to rise in his pale cheeks his nostrils dilated like those of a wild beast that scents its prey and his lips half opened disclosed his white teeth small and sharp like those of a jackal and yet his features wore an expression of smiling tenderness such as franz had never before witnessed in them his black eyes especially were full of kindness and pity however the two culprits advanced and as they approached their faces became visible peppino was a handsome young man of four or five-and-twenty bronzed by the sun he carried his head erect and seemed on the watch to see on which side his liberator would appear andrea was short and fat his visage marked with brutal cruelty did not indicate age he might be thirty in prison he had suffered his beard to grow his head fell on his shoulder his legs bent beneath him and his movements were apparently automatic and unconscious i thought said franz to the count that you told me there would be but one execution i told you true replied he coldly and yet here are two culprits yes but only one of these two is about to die the other has many years to live if the pardon is to come there is no time to lose and see here it is said the count at the moment when peppino reached the foot of the mandaa a priest arrived in some haste forced his way through the soldiers and advancing to the chief of the brotherhood gave him a folded paper the piercing eye of peppino had noticed all the chief took the paper unfolded it and raising his hand heaven be praised and his holiness also said he in a loud voice here is a pardon for one of the prisoners a pardon cried the people with one voice a pardon at this cry andrea raised his head pardon for whom cried he peppino remained breathless a pardon for peppino called rocca priori said the principal friar and he passed the paper to the officer commanding the carbineers who read and returned it to him for peppino cried andrea who seemed roused from the torpor in which he had been plunged why for him and not for me we ought to die together i was promised he should die with me you have no right to put me to death alone i will not die alone i will not and he broke from the priests struggling and raving like a wild beast and striving desperately to break the cords that bound his hands the executioner made a sign and his two assistants leaped from the scaffold and seized him what is going on asked franz of the count for as all the talk was in the roman dialect he had not perfectly understood it do you not see returned the count that this human creature who is about to die is furious that his fellow-sufferer does not perish with him and were he able he would rather tear him to pieces with his teeth and nails than let him enjoy the life he himself is about to be deprived of oh man man race of crocodiles cried the count extending his clenched hands towards the crowd how well do i recognize you there and that at all times you are worthy of yourselves meanwhile andrea and the two executioners were struggling on the ground and he kept exclaiming he ought to die he shall die i will not die alone look look cried the count seizing the young mens hands look for on my soul it is curious here is a man who had resigned himself to his fate who was going to the scaffold to die like a coward it is true but he was about to die without resistance do you know what gave him strength do you know what consoled him it was that another partook of his punishment that another partook of his anguish that another was to die before him lead two sheep to the butchers two oxen to the slaughterhouse and make one of them understand that his companion will not die the sheep will bleat for pleasure the ox will bellow with joy but man man whom god created in his own
