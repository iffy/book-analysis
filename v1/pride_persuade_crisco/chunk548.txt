question i can answer positively no sir he had not because he applied to me six months ago for the particulars he required and as i did not know when i might again come to paris i recommended m cavalcanti to him andrea no bartolomeo his father now sir i have but one question more to ask and i charge you in the name of honor of humanity and of religion to answer me candidly what is it sir do you know with what design m de monte cristo purchased a house at auteuil certainly for he told me what is it sir to make a lunatic asylum of it similar to that founded by the count of pisani at palermo do you know about that institution i have heard of it it is a magnificent charity having said this the abb bowed to imply he wished to pursue his studies the visitor either understood the abbs meaning or had no more questions to ask he arose and the abb accompanied him to the door you are a great almsgiver said the visitor and although you are said to be rich i will venture to offer you something for your poor people will you accept my offering i thank you sir i am only jealous in one thing and that is that the relief i give should be entirely from my own resources however my resolution sir is unchangeable but you have only to search for yourself and you will find alas but too many objects upon whom to exercise your benevolence the abb once more bowed as he opened the door the stranger bowed and took his leave and the carriage conveyed him straight to the house of m de villefort an hour afterwards the carriage was again ordered and this time it went to the rue fontaine-saint-georges and stopped at no where lord wilmore lived the stranger had written to lord wilmore requesting an interview which the latter had fixed for ten oclock as the envoy of the prefect of police arrived ten minutes before ten he was told that lord wilmore who was precision and punctuality personified was not yet come in but that he would be sure to return as the clock struck the visitor was introduced into the drawing-room which was like all other furnished drawing-rooms a mantle-piece with two modern svres vases a timepiece representing cupid with his bent bow a mirror with an engraving on each side one representing homer carrying his guide the other belisarius begging a grayish paper red and black tapestry such was the appearance of lord wilmores drawing-room it was illuminated by lamps with ground-glass shades which gave only a feeble light as if out of consideration for the envoys weak sight after ten minutes expectation the clock struck ten at the fifth stroke the door opened and lord wilmore appeared he was rather above the middle height with thin reddish whiskers light complexion and light hair turning rather gray he was dressed with all the english peculiarity namely in a blue coat with gilt buttons and high collar in the fashion of a white kerseymere waistcoat and nankeen pantaloons three inches too short but which were prevented by straps from slipping up to the knee his first remark on entering was you know sir i do not speak french i know you do not like to converse in our language replied the envoy but you may use it replied lord wilmore i understand it and i replied the visitor changing his idiom know enough of english to keep up the conversation do not put yourself to the slightest inconvenience aw said lord wilmore with that tone which is only known to natives of great britain the envoy presented his letter of introduction which the latter read with english coolness and having finished i understand said he perfectly m then began the questions which were similar to those which had been addressed to the abb busoni but as lord wilmore in the character of the counts enemy was less restrained in his answers they were more numerous he described the youth of monte cristo who he said at ten years of age entered the service of one of the petty sovereigns of india who make war on the english it was there wilmore had first met him and fought against him and in that war zaccone had been taken prisoner sent to england and consigned to the hulks whence he had escaped by swimming then began his travels his duels his caprices then the insurrection in greece broke out and he had served in the grecian ranks while in that service he had discovered a silver mine in the mountains of thessaly but he had been careful to conceal it from everyone after the battle of navarino when the greek government was consolidated he asked of king otho a mining grant for that district which was given him hence that immense fortune which in lord wilmores opinion possibly amounted to one or two millions per annum a precarious fortune which might be momentarily lost by the failure of the mine but asked the visitor do you know why he came to france he is speculating in railways said lord wilmore and as he is an expert chemist and physicist he has invented a new system of telegraphy which he is seeking
