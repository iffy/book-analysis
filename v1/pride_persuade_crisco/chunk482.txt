no gainsaying the fact that a very unfavorable construction would have been put upon the circumstance if the two women had gone without escort while the addition of a third in the person of her mothers admitted lover enabled mademoiselle danglars to defy malice and ill-nature one must take the world as one finds it m the curtain rose as usual to an almost empty house it being one of the absurdities of parisian fashion never to appear at the opera until after the beginning of the performance so that the first act is generally played without the slightest attention being paid to it that part of the audience already assembled being too much occupied in observing the fresh arrivals while nothing is heard but the noise of opening and shutting doors and the buzz of conversation surely said albert as the door of a box on the first circle opened that must be the countess g and who is the countess g inquired chteau-renaud what a question now do you know baron i have a great mind to pick a quarrel with you for asking it as if all the world did not know who the countess g was ah to be sure replied chteau-renaud the lovely venetian is it not herself at this moment the countess perceived albert and returned his salutation with a smile you know her it seems said chteau-renaud franz introduced me to her at rome replied albert well then will you do as much for me in paris as franz did for you in rome with pleasure there was a cry of shut up from the audience this manifestation on the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to hear the music produced not the slightest effect on the two young men who continued their conversation the countess was present at the races in the champ-de-mars said chteau-renaud today yes bless me i quite forgot the races did you bet oh merely a paltry fifty louis and who was the winner nautilus i staked on him but there were three races were there not yes there was the prize given by the jockey club a gold cup you know and a very singular circumstance occurred about that race what was it oh shut up again interposed some of the audience why it was won by a horse and rider utterly unknown on the course is that possible true as day the fact was nobody had observed a horse entered by the name of vampa or that of a jockey styled job when at the last moment a splendid roan mounted by a jockey about as big as your fist presented themselves at the starting-post they were obliged to stuff at least twenty pounds weight of shot in the small riders pockets to make him weight but with all that he outstripped ariel and barbare against whom he ran by at least three whole lengths and was it not found out at last to whom the horse and jockey belonged no you say that the horse was entered under the name of vampa exactly that was the title then answered albert i am better informed than you are and know who the owner of that horse was shut up there cried the pit in chorus and this time the tone and manner in which the command was given betokened such growing hostility that the two young men perceived for the first time that the mandate was addressed to them leisurely turning round they calmly scrutinized the various countenances around them as though demanding some one person who would take upon himself the responsibility of what they deemed excessive impertinence but as no one responded to the challenge the friends turned again to the front of the theatre and affected to busy themselves with the stage at this moment the door of the ministers box opened and madame danglars accompanied by her daughter entered escorted by lucien debray who assiduously conducted them to their seats ha ha said chteau-renaud here come some friends of yours viscount what are you looking at there dont you see they are trying to catch your eye albert turned round just in time to receive a gracious wave of the fan from the baroness as for mademoiselle eugnie she scarcely vouchsafed to waste the glances of her large black eyes even upon the business of the stage i tell you what my dear fellow said chteau-renaud i cannot imagine what objection you can possibly have to mademoiselle danglars that is setting aside her want of ancestry and somewhat inferior rank which by the way i dont think you care very much about now barring all that i mean to say she is a deuced fine girl handsome certainly replied albert but not to my taste which i confess inclines to something softer gentler and more feminine ah well exclaimed chteau-renaud who because he had seen his thirtieth summer fancied himself duly warranted in assuming a sort of paternal air with his more youthful friend you young people are never satisfied why what would you have more your parents have chosen you a bride built on the model of diana the huntress and yet you are not content no for that very resemblance affrights me i should have liked something more in the manner of the venus of milo or capua
