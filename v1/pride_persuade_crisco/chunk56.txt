were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view mr collins attending them to point out its beauties and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which mr collins had promised and as he had likewise foretold he took his seat at the bottom of the table by her ladyships desire and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater he carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity and every dish was commended first by him and then by sir william who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and gave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them the party did not supply much conversation elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time mrs jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she was indisposed maria thought speaking out of the question and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire when the ladies returned to the drawing-room there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any intermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgement controverted she enquired into charlottes domestic concerns familiarly and minutely gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great ladys attention which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others in the intervals of her discourse with mrs collins she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knew the least and who she observed to mrs collins was a very genteel pretty kind of girl she asked her at different times how many sisters she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been her mothers maiden name elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly lady catherine then observed your fathers estate is entailed on mr collins i think for your sake turning to charlotte i am glad of it but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourghs family do you play and sing miss bennet a little oh then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you our instrument is a capital one probably superior to you shall try it some day do your sisters play and sing one of them does why did not you all learn you ought all to have learned the miss webbs all play and their father has not so good an income as yours do you draw no not at all what none of you not one that is very strange but i suppose you had no opportunity your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters my mother would have had no objection but my father hates london has your governess left you we never had any governess no governess how was that possible five daughters brought up at home without a governess i never heard of such a thing your mother must have been quite a slave to your education elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case then who taught you who attended to you without a governess you must have been neglected compared with some families i believe we were but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means we were always encouraged to read and had all the masters that were necessary those who chose to be idle certainly might aye no doubt but that is what a governess will prevent and if i had known your mother i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way i am always glad to get a young person well placed out four nieces of mrs jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means and it was but the other day that i recommended another young person who was merely accidentally mentioned to me and the family are quite delighted with her mrs collins did i tell you of lady
