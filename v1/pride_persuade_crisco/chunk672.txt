tumult what she had regarded as something distressing was in reality a disgrace and then the baroness remembered that she had felt no pity for poor mercds who had been afflicted with as severe a blow through her husband and son eugnie she said to herself is lost and so are we the affair as it will be reported will cover us with shame for in a society such as ours satire inflicts a painful and incurable wound how fortunate that eugnie is possessed of that strange character which has so often made me tremble and her glance was turned towards heaven where a mysterious providence disposes all things and out of a fault nay even a vice sometimes produces a blessing and then her thoughts cleaving through space like a bird in the air rested on cavalcanti this andrea was a wretch a robber an assassin and yet his manners showed the effects of a sort of education if not a complete one he had been presented to the world with the appearance of an immense fortune supported by an honorable name how could she extricate herself from this labyrinth to whom would she apply to help her out of this painful situation debray to whom she had run with the first instinct of a woman towards the man she loves and who yet betrays her debray could but give her advice she must apply to someone more powerful than he the baroness then thought of m de villefort it was m de villefort who had remorselessly brought misfortune into her family as though they had been strangers but no on reflection the procureur was not a merciless man and it was not the magistrate slave to his duties but the friend the loyal friend who roughly but firmly cut into the very core of the corruption it was not the executioner but the surgeon who wished to withdraw the honor of danglars from ignominious association with the disgraced young man they had presented to the world as their son-in-law and since villefort the friend of danglars had acted in this way no one could suppose that he had been previously acquainted with or had lent himself to any of andreas intrigues villeforts conduct therefore upon reflection appeared to the baroness as if shaped for their mutual advantage but the inflexibility of the procureur should stop there she would see him the next day and if she could not make him fail in his duties as a magistrate she would at least obtain all the indulgence he could allow she would invoke the past recall old recollections she would supplicate him by the remembrance of guilty yet happy days m de villefort would stifle the affair he had only to turn his eyes on one side and allow andrea to fly and follow up the crime under that shadow of guilt called contempt of court and after this reasoning she slept easily at nine oclock next morning she arose and without ringing for her maid or giving the least sign of her activity she dressed herself in the same simple style as on the previous night then running downstairs she left the hotel walked to the rue de provence called a cab and drove to m de villeforts house for the last month this wretched house had presented the gloomy appearance of a lazaretto infected with the plague some of the apartments were closed within and without the shutters were only opened to admit a minutes air showing the scared face of a footman and immediately afterwards the window would be closed like a gravestone falling on a sepulchre and the neighbors would say to each other in a low voice will there be another funeral today at the procureurs house madame danglars involuntarily shuddered at the desolate aspect of the mansion descending from the cab she approached the door with trembling knees and rang the bell three times did the bell ring with a dull heavy sound seeming to participate in the general sadness before the concierge appeared and peeped through the door which he opened just wide enough to allow his words to be heard he saw a lady a fashionable elegantly dressed lady and yet the door remained almost closed do you intend opening the door said the baroness first madame who are you who am i you know me well enough we no longer know anyone madame you must be mad my friend said the baroness where do you come from oh this is too much madame these are my orders excuse me your name the baroness danglars you have seen me twenty times possibly madame and now what do you want oh how extraordinary i shall complain to m de villefort of the impertinence of his servants madame this is precaution not impertinence no one enters here without an order from m davrigny or without speaking to the procureur well i have business with the procureur is it pressing business you can imagine so since i have not even brought my carriage out yet but enough of this here is my card take it to your master madame will await my return yes go the concierge closed the door leaving madame danglars in the street she had not long to wait directly afterwards the door was opened wide enough to admit her and when she had
