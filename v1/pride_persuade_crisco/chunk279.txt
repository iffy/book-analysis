shipwrecked persons had died through having eagerly devoured too much food edmond replaced on the table the bread he was about to devour and returned to his couch he did not wish to die he soon felt that his ideas became again collected he could think and strengthen his thoughts by reasoning then he said to himself i must put this to the test but without compromising anybody if it is a workman i need but knock against the wall and he will cease to work in order to find out who is knocking and why he does so but as his occupation is sanctioned by the governor he will soon resume it if on the contrary it is a prisoner the noise i make will alarm him he will cease and not begin again until he thinks everyone is asleep edmond rose again but this time his legs did not tremble and his sight was clear he went to a corner of his dungeon detached a stone and with it knocked against the wall where the sound came he struck thrice at the first blow the sound ceased as if by magic edmond listened intently an hour passed two hours passed and no sound was heard from the wall all was silent there full of hope edmond swallowed a few mouthfuls of bread and water and thanks to the vigor of his constitution found himself well-nigh recovered the day passed away in utter silence night came without recurrence of the noise it is a prisoner said edmond joyfully his brain was on fire and life and energy returned the night passed in perfect silence edmond did not close his eyes in the morning the jailer brought him fresh provisions he had already devoured those of the previous day he ate these listening anxiously for the sound walking round and round his cell shaking the iron bars of the loophole restoring vigor and agility to his limbs by exercise and so preparing himself for his future destiny at intervals he listened to learn if the noise had not begun again and grew impatient at the prudence of the prisoner who did not guess he had been disturbed by a captive as anxious for liberty as himself three days passed seventy-two long tedious hours which he counted off by minutes at length one evening as the jailer was visiting him for the last time that night dants with his ear for the hundredth time at the wall fancied he heard an almost imperceptible movement among the stones he moved away walked up and down his cell to collect his thoughts and then went back and listened the matter was no longer doubtful something was at work on the other side of the wall the prisoner had discovered the danger and had substituted a lever for a chisel encouraged by this discovery edmond determined to assist the indefatigable laborer he began by moving his bed and looked around for anything with which he could pierce the wall penetrate the moist cement and displace a stone he saw nothing he had no knife or sharp instrument the window grating was of iron but he had too often assured himself of its solidity all his furniture consisted of a bed a chair a table a pail and a jug the bed had iron clamps but they were screwed to the wood and it would have required a screw-driver to take them off the table and chair had nothing the pail had once possessed a handle but that had been removed m dants had but one resource which was to break the jug and with one of the sharp fragments attack the wall he let the jug fall on the floor and it broke in pieces dants concealed two or three of the sharpest fragments in his bed leaving the rest on the floor the breaking of his jug was too natural an accident to excite suspicion edmond had all the night to work in but in the darkness he could not do much and he soon felt that he was working against something very hard he pushed back his bed and waited for day all night he heard the subterranean workman who continued to mine his way day came the jailer entered dants told him that the jug had fallen from his hands while he was drinking and the jailer went grumblingly to fetch another without giving himself the trouble to remove the fragments of the broken one he returned speedily advised the prisoner to be more careful and departed dants heard joyfully the key grate in the lock he listened until the sound of steps died away and then hastily displacing his bed saw by the faint light that penetrated into his cell that he had labored uselessly the previous evening in attacking the stone instead of removing the plaster that surrounded it the damp had rendered it friable and dants was able to break it off in small morsels it is true but at the end of half an hour he had scraped off a handful a mathematician might have calculated that in two years supposing that the rock was not encountered a passage twenty feet long and two feet broad might be formed the prisoner reproached himself with not having thus employed the hours he had passed in vain hopes prayer and despondency
