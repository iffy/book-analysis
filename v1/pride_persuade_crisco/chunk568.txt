you who i am how much i love mademoiselle valentine and what are my designs respecting her noirtier made a sign that he would listen it was an imposing sight to witness this old man apparently a mere useless burden becoming the sole protector support and adviser of the lovers who were both young beautiful and strong his remarkably noble and austere expression struck morrel who began his story with trembling he related the manner in which he had become acquainted with valentine and how he had loved her and that valentine in her solitude and her misfortune had accepted the offer of his devotion he told him his birth his position his fortune and more than once when he consulted the look of the paralytic that look answered that is good proceed and now said morrel when he had finished the first part of his recital now i have told you of my love and my hopes may i inform you of my intentions yes signified the old man this was our resolution a cabriolet was in waiting at the gate in which i intended to carry off valentine to my sisters house to marry her and to wait respectfully m de villeforts pardon no said noirtier we must not do so no you do not sanction our project no there is another way said morrel the old mans interrogative eye said which i will go continued maximilian i will seek m franz dpinay i am happy to be able to mention this in mademoiselle de villeforts absence and will conduct myself toward him so as to compel him to challenge me noirtiers look continued to interrogate you wish to know what i will do yes i will find him as i told you i will tell him the ties which bind me to mademoiselle valentine if he be a sensible man he will prove it by renouncing of his own accord the hand of his betrothed and will secure my friendship and love until death if he refuse either through interest or ridiculous pride after i have proved to him that he would be forcing my wife from me that valentine loves me and will have no other i will fight with him give him every advantage and i shall kill him or he will kill me if i am victorious he will not marry valentine and if i die i am very sure valentine will not marry him noirtier watched with indescribable pleasure this noble and sincere countenance on which every sentiment his tongue uttered was depicted adding by the expression of his fine features all that coloring adds to a sound and faithful drawing still when morrel had finished he shut his eyes several times which was his manner of saying no no said morrel you disapprove of this second project as you did of the first i do signified the old man but what then must be done asked morrel madame de saint-mrans last request was that the marriage might not be delayed must i let things take their course noirtier did not move i understand said morrel i am to wait yes but delay may ruin our plan sir replied the young man alone valentine has no power she will be compelled to submit i am here almost miraculously and can scarcely hope for so good an opportunity to occur again believe me there are only the two plans i have proposed to you forgive my vanity and tell me which you prefer do you authorize mademoiselle valentine to intrust herself to my honor no do you prefer i should seek m dpinay no whence then will come the help we need from chance resumed morrel no from you yes you thoroughly understand me sir pardon my eagerness for my life depends on your answer will our help come from you yes you are sure of it yes there was so much firmness in the look which gave this answer no one could at any rate doubt his will if they did his power oh thank you a thousand times but how unless a miracle should restore your speech your gesture your movement how can you chained to that armchair dumb and motionless oppose this marriage a smile lit up the old mans face a strange smile of the eyes in a paralyzed face then i must wait asked the young man yes but the contract the same smile returned will you assure me it shall not be signed yes said noirtier the contract shall not be signed cried morrel oh pardon me sir i can scarcely realize so great a happiness will they not sign it no said the paralytic notwithstanding that assurance morrel still hesitated this promise of an impotent old man was so strange that instead of being the result of the power of his will it might emanate from enfeebled organs is it not natural that the madman ignorant of his folly should attempt things beyond his power the weak man talks of burdens he can raise the timid of giants he can confront the poor of treasures he spends the most humble peasant in the height of his pride calls himself jupiter whether noirtier understood the young mans indecision or whether he had not full confidence in his docility he looked uneasily at him what do you wish sir asked morrel
