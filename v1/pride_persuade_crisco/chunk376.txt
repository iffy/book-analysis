free entrance to the brilliant moonbeams that now illumined the vast pile grew a quantity of creeping plants whose delicate green branches stood out in bold relief against the clear azure of the firmament while large masses of thick strong fibrous shoots forced their way through the chasm and hung floating to and fro like so many waving strings the person whose mysterious arrival had attracted the attention of franz stood in a kind of half-light that rendered it impossible to distinguish his features although his dress was easily made out he wore a large brown mantle one fold of which thrown over his left shoulder served likewise to mask the lower part of his countenance while the upper part was completely hidden by his broad-brimmed hat the lower part of his dress was more distinctly visible by the bright rays of the moon which entering through the broken ceiling shed their refulgent beams on feet cased in elegantly made boots of polished leather over which descended fashionably cut trousers of black cloth m from the imperfect means franz had of judging he could only come to one conclusion that the person whom he was thus watching certainly belonged to no inferior station of life some few minutes had elapsed and the stranger began to show manifest signs of impatience when a slight noise was heard outside the aperture in the roof and almost immediately a dark shadow seemed to obstruct the flood of light that had entered it and the figure of a man was clearly seen gazing with eager scrutiny on the immense space beneath him then as his eye caught sight of him in the mantle he grasped a floating mass of thickly matted boughs and glided down by their help to within three or four feet of the ground and then leaped lightly on his feet the man who had performed this daring act with so much indifference wore the transtevere costume i beg your excellencys pardon for keeping you waiting said the man in the roman dialect but i dont think im many minutes after my time ten oclock has just struck by the clock of saint john lateran say not a word about being late replied the stranger in purest tuscan tis i who am too soon but even if you had caused me to wait a little while i should have felt quite sure that the delay was not occasioned by any fault of yours your excellency is perfectly right in so thinking said the man i came here direct from the castle of st angelo and i had an immense deal of trouble before i could get a chance to speak to beppo and who is beppo oh beppo is employed in the prison and i give him so much a year to let me know what is going on within his holinesss castle indeed you are a provident person i see why you see no one knows what may happen perhaps some of these days i may be entrapped like poor peppino and may be very glad to have some little nibbling mouse to gnaw the meshes of my net and so help me out of prison briefly what did you learn that two executions of considerable interest will take place the day after tomorrow at two oclock as is customary at rome at the commencement of all great festivals one of the culprits will be mazzolato he is an atrocious villain who murdered the priest who brought him up and deserves not the smallest pity the other sufferer is sentenced to be decapitato and he your excellency is poor peppino the fact is that you have inspired not only the pontifical government but also the neighboring states with such extreme fear that they are glad of all opportunity of making an example but peppino did not even belong to my band he was merely a poor shepherd whose only crime consisted in furnishing us with provisions which makes him your accomplice to all intents and purposes but mark the distinction with which he is treated instead of being knocked on the head as you would be if once they caught hold of you he is simply sentenced to be guillotined by which means too the amusements of the day are diversified and there is a spectacle to please every spectator without reckoning the wholly unexpected one i am preparing to surprise them with my good friend said the man in the cloak excuse me for saying that you seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild or extravagant act perhaps i am but one thing i have resolved on and that is to stop at nothing to restore a poor devil to liberty who has got into this scrape solely from having served me i should hate and despise myself as a coward did i desert the brave fellow in his present extremity and what do you mean to do to surround the scaffold with twenty of my best men who at a signal from me will rush forward directly peppino is brought for execution and by the assistance of their stilettos drive back the guard and carry off the prisoner that seems to me as hazardous as uncertain and convinces me that my scheme is far better than yours and what is your excellencys project just this i
