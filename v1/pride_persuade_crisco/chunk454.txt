met you sooner you are setting up an establishment of course why yes replied the count i should have liked to have made you the offer of these horses i have almost given them away as it is but as i before said i was anxious to get rid of them upon any terms they were only fit for a young man i am much obliged by your kind intentions towards me said monte cristo but this morning i purchased a very excellent pair of carriage-horses and i do not think they were dear there they are come m debray you are a connoisseur i believe let me have your opinion upon them as debray walked towards the window danglars approached his wife i could not tell you before others said he in a low tone the reason of my parting with the horses but a most enormous price was offered me this morning for them some madman or fool bent upon ruining himself as fast as he can actually sent his steward to me to purchase them at any cost and the fact is i have gained francs by the sale of them come dont look so angry and you shall have francs of the money to do what you like with and eugnie shall have there what do you think now of the affair wasnt i right to part with the horses madame danglars surveyed her husband with a look of withering contempt great heavens suddenly exclaimed debray what is it asked the baroness i cannot be mistaken there are your horses the very animals we were speaking of harnessed to the counts carriage my dappled grays demanded the baroness springing to the window tis indeed they said she danglars looked absolutely stupefied how very singular cried monte cristo with well-feigned astonishment i cannot believe it murmured the banker madame danglars whispered a few words in the ear of debray who approached monte cristo saying the baroness wishes to know what you paid her husband for the horses i scarcely know replied the count it was a little surprise prepared for me by my steward and cost me well somewhere about francs debray conveyed the counts reply to the baroness poor danglars looked so crest-fallen and discomfited that monte cristo assumed a pitying air towards him see said the count how very ungrateful women are your kind attention in providing for the safety of the baroness by disposing of the horses does not seem to have made the least impression on her but so it is a woman will often from mere wilfulness prefer that which is dangerous to that which is safe therefore in my opinion my dear baron the best and easiest way is to leave them to their fancies and allow them to act as they please and then if any mischief follows why at least they have no one to blame but themselves danglars made no reply he was occupied in anticipations of the coming scene between himself and the baroness whose frowning brow like that of olympic jove predicted a storm debray who perceived the gathering clouds and felt no desire to witness the explosion of madame danglars rage suddenly recollected an appointment which compelled him to take his leave while monte cristo unwilling by prolonging his stay to destroy the advantages he hoped to obtain made a farewell bow and departed leaving danglars to endure the angry reproaches of his wife m excellent murmured monte cristo to himself as he came away all has gone according to my wishes the domestic peace of this family is henceforth in my hands now then to play another master-stroke by which i shall gain the heart of both husband and wife delightful still added he amid all this i have not yet been presented to mademoiselle eugnie danglars whose acquaintance i should have been glad to make but he went on with his peculiar smile i am here in paris and have plenty of time before me by and by will do for that with these reflections he entered his carriage and returned home two hours afterwards madame danglars received a most flattering epistle from the count in which he entreated her to receive back her favorite dappled grays protesting that he could not endure the idea of making his entry into the parisian world of fashion with the knowledge that his splendid equipage had been obtained at the price of a lovely womans regrets the horses were sent back wearing the same harness she had seen on them in the morning only by the counts orders in the centre of each rosette that adorned either side of their heads had been fastened a large diamond to danglars monte cristo also wrote requesting him to excuse the whimsical gift of a capricious millionaire and to beg the baroness to pardon the eastern fashion adopted in the return of the horses during the evening monte cristo quitted paris for auteuil accompanied by ali the following day about three oclock a single blow struck on the gong summoned ali to the presence of the count ali observed his master as the nubian entered the chamber you have frequently explained to me how more than commonly skilful you are in throwing the lasso have you not ali drew himself up proudly and then returned a sign in the affirmative i
