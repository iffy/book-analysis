sight of such surpassing beauty beheld as it was for the first time and of which an inhabitant of more northern climes could form no adequate idea whom do you bring asked the young girl in romaic of monte cristo is it a friend a brother a simple acquaintance or an enemy a friend said monte cristo in the same language what is his name count albert it is the same man whom i rescued from the hands of the banditti at rome in what language would you like me to converse with him monte cristo turned to albert do you know modern greek asked he alas no said albert nor even ancient greek my dear count never had homer or plato a more unworthy scholar than myself then said hayde proving by her remark that she had quite understood monte cristos question and alberts answer then i will speak either in french or italian if my lord so wills it monte cristo reflected one instant you will speak in italian said he then turning towards albert it is a pity you do not understand either ancient or modern greek both of which hayde speaks so fluently the poor child will be obliged to talk to you in italian which will give you but a very false idea of her powers of conversation the count made a sign to hayde to address his visitor sir she said to morcerf you are most welcome as the friend of my lord and master this was said in excellent tuscan and with that soft roman accent which makes the language of dante as sonorous as that of homer then turning to ali she directed him to bring coffee and pipes and when he had left the room to execute the orders of his young mistress she beckoned albert to approach nearer to her monte cristo and morcerf drew their seats towards a small table on which were arranged music drawings and vases of flowers ali then entered bringing coffee and chibouques as to m baptistin this portion of the building was interdicted to him albert refused the pipe which the nubian offered him oh take it take it said the count hayde is almost as civilized as a parisian the smell of a havana is disagreeable to her but the tobacco of the east is a most delicious perfume you know ali left the room the cups of coffee were all prepared with the addition of sugar which had been brought for albert monte cristo and hayde took the beverage in the original arabian manner that is to say without sugar hayde took the porcelain cup in her little slender fingers and conveyed it to her mouth with all the innocent artlessness of a child when eating or drinking something which it likes at this moment two women entered bringing salvers filled with ices and sherbet which they placed on two small tables appropriated to that purpose my dear host and you signora said albert in italian excuse my apparent stupidity i am quite bewildered and it is natural that it should be so here i am in the heart of paris but a moment ago i heard the rumbling of the omnibuses and the tinkling of the bells of the lemonade-sellers and now i feel as if i were suddenly transported to the east not such as i have seen it but such as my dreams have painted it oh signora if i could but speak greek your conversation added to the fairy-scene which surrounds me would furnish an evening of such delight as it would be impossible for me ever to forget i speak sufficient italian to enable me to converse with you sir said hayde quietly and if you like what is eastern i will do my best to secure the gratification of your tastes while you are here on what subject shall i converse with her said albert in a low tone to monte cristo just what you please you may speak of her country and of her youthful reminiscences or if you like it better you can talk of rome naples or florence oh said albert it is of no use to be in the company of a greek if one converses just in the same style as with a parisian let me speak to her of the east do so then for of all themes which you could choose that will be the most agreeable to her taste albert turned towards hayde at what age did you leave greece signora asked he i left it when i was but five years old replied hayde and have you any recollection of your country when i shut my eyes and think i seem to see it all again the mind can see as well as the body the body forgets sometimes but the mind always remembers and how far back into the past do your recollections extend i could scarcely walk when my mother who was called vasiliki which means royal said the young girl tossing her head proudly took me by the hand and after putting in our purse all the money we possessed we went out both covered with veils to solicit alms for the prisoners saying he who giveth to the poor lendeth to the lord then when our purse was full we returned to the palace and
