soon afterwards and taking a station with less bare-faced design by anne you have not been long enough in bath said he to enjoy the evening parties of the place oh no the usual character of them has nothing for me i am no card-player you were not formerly i know you did not use to like cards but time makes many changes i am not yet so much changed cried anne and stopped fearing she hardly knew what misconstruction after waiting a few moments he said and as if it were the result of immediate feeling it is a period indeed eight years and a half is a period whether he would have proceeded farther was left to anne's imagination to ponder over in a calmer hour for while still hearing the sounds he had uttered she was startled to other subjects by henrietta eager to make use of the present leisure for getting out and calling on her companions to lose no time lest somebody else should come in they were obliged to move anne talked of being perfectly ready and tried to look it but she felt that could henrietta have known the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair in preparing to quit the room she would have found in all her own sensations for her cousin in the very security of his affection wherewith to pity her their preparations however were stopped short alarming sounds were heard other visitors approached and the door was thrown open for sir walter and miss elliot whose entrance seemed to give a general chill anne felt an instant oppression and wherever she looked saw symptoms of the same the comfort the freedom the gaiety of the room was over hushed into cold composure determined silence or insipid talk to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister how mortifying to feel that it was so her jealous eye was satisfied in one particular captain wentworth was acknowledged again by each by elizabeth more graciously than before she even addressed him once and looked at him more than once elizabeth was in fact revolving a great measure the sequel explained it after the waste of a few minutes in saying the proper nothings she began to give the invitation which was to comprise all the remaining dues of the musgroves to-morrow evening to meet a few friends no formal party it was all said very gracefully and the cards with which she had provided herself the miss elliot at home were laid on the table with a courteous comprehensive smile to all and one smile and one card more decidedly for captain wentworth the truth was that elizabeth had been long enough in bath to understand the importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his the past was nothing the present was that captain wentworth would move about well in her drawing-room the card was pointedly given and sir walter and elizabeth arose and disappeared the interruption had been short though severe and ease and animation returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out but not to anne she could think only of the invitation she had with such astonishment witnessed and of the manner in which it had been received a manner of doubtful meaning of surprise rather than gratification of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance she knew him she saw disdain in his eye and could not venture to believe that he had determined to accept such an offering as an atonement for all the insolence of the past her spirits sank he held the card in his hand after they were gone as if deeply considering it only think of elizabeth's including everybody whispered mary very audibly i do not wonder captain wentworth is delighted you see he cannot put the card out of his hand anne caught his eye saw his cheeks glow and his mouth form itself into a momentary expression of contempt and turned away that she might neither see nor hear more to vex her the party separated the gentlemen had their own pursuits the ladies proceeded on their own business and they met no more while anne belonged to them she was earnestly begged to return and dine and give them all the rest of the day but her spirits had been so long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more and fit only for home where she might be sure of being as silent as she chose promising to be with them the whole of the following morning therefore she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to camden place there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements of elizabeth and mrs clay for the morrow's party the frequent enumeration of the persons invited and the continually improving detail of all the embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant of its kind in bath while harassing herself with the never-ending question of whether captain wentworth would come or not they were reckoning him as certain but with her it was a gnawing solicitude never appeased for five minutes together she generally thought he would come because she generally thought he ought but it was a case which she could not so shape into any positive act of duty
