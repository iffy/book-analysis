stones then this stucco had been applied and painted to imitate granite dants struck with the sharp end of his pickaxe which entered someway between the interstices it was there he must dig but by some strange play of emotion in proportion as the proofs that faria had not been deceived became stronger so did his heart give way and a feeling of discouragement stole over him this last proof instead of giving him fresh strength deprived him of it the pickaxe descended or rather fell he placed it on the ground passed his hand over his brow and remounted the stairs alleging to himself as an excuse a desire to be assured that no one was watching him but in reality because he felt that he was about to faint the island was deserted and the sun seemed to cover it with its fiery glance afar off a few small fishing boats studded the bosom of the blue ocean dants had tasted nothing but he thought not of hunger at such a moment he hastily swallowed a few drops of rum and again entered the cavern the pickaxe that had seemed so heavy was now like a feather in his grasp he seized it and attacked the wall after several blows he perceived that the stones were not cemented but had been merely placed one upon the other and covered with stucco he inserted the point of his pickaxe and using the handle as a lever with joy soon saw the stone turn as if on hinges and fall at his feet he had nothing more to do now but with the iron tooth of the pickaxe to draw the stones towards him one by one the aperture was already sufficiently large for him to enter but by waiting he could still cling to hope and retard the certainty of deception at last after renewed hesitation dants entered the second grotto the second grotto was lower and more gloomy than the first the air that could only enter by the newly formed opening had the mephitic smell dants was surprised not to find in the outer cavern he waited in order to allow pure air to displace the foul atmosphere and then went on at the left of the opening was a dark and deep angle but to dants eye there was no darkness he glanced around this second grotto it was like the first empty the treasure if it existed was buried in this corner the time had at length arrived two feet of earth removed and dants fate would be decided he advanced towards the angle and summoning all his resolution attacked the ground with the pickaxe at the fifth or sixth blow the pickaxe struck against an iron substance never did funeral knell never did alarm-bell produce a greater effect on the hearer had dants found nothing he could not have become more ghastly pale he again struck his pickaxe into the earth and encountered the same resistance but not the same sound it is a casket of wood bound with iron thought he at this moment a shadow passed rapidly before the opening dants seized his gun sprang through the opening and mounted the stair a wild goat had passed before the mouth of the cave and was feeding at a little distance this would have been a favorable occasion to secure his dinner but dants feared lest the report of his gun should attract attention he thought a moment cut a branch of a resinous tree lighted it at the fire at which the smugglers had prepared their breakfast and descended with this torch he wished to see everything he approached the hole he had dug and now with the aid of the torch saw that his pickaxe had in reality struck against iron and wood he planted his torch in the ground and resumed his labor in an instant a space three feet long by two feet broad was cleared and dants could see an oaken coffer bound with cut steel in the middle of the lid he saw engraved on a silver plate which was still untarnished the arms of the spada family viz a sword en pale on an oval shield like all the italian armorial bearings and surmounted by a cardinals hat dants easily recognized them faria had so often drawn them for him there was no longer any doubt the treasure was there no one would have been at such pains to conceal an empty casket in an instant he had cleared every obstacle away and he saw successively the lock placed between two padlocks and the two handles at each end all carved as things were carved at that epoch when art rendered the commonest metals precious dants seized the handles and strove to lift the coffer it was impossible he sought to open it lock and padlock were fastened these faithful guardians seemed unwilling to surrender their trust dants inserted the sharp end of the pickaxe between the coffer and the lid and pressing with all his force on the handle burst open the fastenings the hinges yielded in their turn and fell still holding in their grasp fragments of the wood and the chest was open m edmond was seized with vertigo he cocked his gun and laid it beside him he then closed his eyes as children
