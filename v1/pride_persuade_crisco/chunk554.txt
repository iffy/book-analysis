misfortune indeed i should expect misfortunes m de villefort is here well he comes to fetch his wife and daughter why so because madame de saint-mran is just arrived in paris bringing the news of m de saint-mrans death which took place on the first stage after he left marseilles madame de villefort who was in very good spirits would neither believe nor think of the misfortune but mademoiselle valentine at the first words guessed the whole truth notwithstanding all the precautions of her father the blow struck her like a thunderbolt and she fell senseless and how was m de saint-mran related to mademoiselle de villefort said the count he was her grandfather on the mothers side he was coming here to hasten her marriage with franz ah indeed so franz must wait why was not m de saint-mran also grandfather to mademoiselle danglars albert albert said madame de morcerf in a tone of mild reproof what are you saying ah count he esteems you so highly tell him that he has spoken amiss and she took two or three steps forward monte cristo watched her with an air so thoughtful and so full of affectionate admiration that she turned back and grasped his hand at the same time she seized that of her son and joined them together we are friends are we not she asked oh madame i do not presume to call myself your friend but at all times i am your most respectful servant the countess left with an indescribable pang in her heart and before she had taken ten steps the count saw her raise her handkerchief to her eyes do not my mother and you agree asked albert astonished on the contrary replied the count did you not hear her declare that we were friends they re-entered the drawing-room which valentine and madame de villefort had just quitted it is perhaps needless to add that morrel departed almost at the same time chapter madame de saint-mran a gloomy scene had indeed just passed at the house of m de villefort after the ladies had departed for the ball whither all the entreaties of madame de villefort had failed in persuading him to accompany them the procureur had shut himself up in his study according to his custom with a heap of papers calculated to alarm anyone else but which generally scarcely satisfied his inordinate desires but this time the papers were a mere matter of form villefort had secluded himself not to study but to reflect and with the door locked and orders given that he should not be disturbed excepting for important business he sat down in his armchair and began to ponder over the events the remembrance of which had during the last eight days filled his mind with so many gloomy thoughts and bitter recollections then instead of plunging into the mass of documents piled before him he opened the drawer of his desk touched a spring and drew out a parcel of cherished memoranda amongst which he had carefully arranged in characters only known to himself the names of all those who either in his political career in money matters at the bar or in his mysterious love affairs had become his enemies their number was formidable now that he had begun to fear and yet these names powerful though they were had often caused him to smile with the same kind of satisfaction experienced by a traveller who from the summit of a mountain beholds at his feet the craggy eminences the almost impassable paths and the fearful chasms through which he has so perilously climbed when he had run over all these names in his memory again read and studied them commenting meanwhile upon his lists he shook his head no he murmured none of my enemies would have waited so patiently and laboriously for so long a space of time that they might now come and crush me with this secret sometimes as hamlet says foul deeds will rise though all the earth oerwhelm them to mens eyes but like a phosphoric light they rise but to mislead the story has been told by the corsican to some priest who in his turn has repeated it m de monte cristo may have heard it and to enlighten himself but why should he wish to enlighten himself upon the subject asked villefort after a moments reflection what interest can this m de monte cristo or m zaccone son of a shipowner of malta discoverer of a mine in thessaly now visiting paris for the first time what interest i say can he take in discovering a gloomy mysterious and useless fact like this however among all the incoherent details given to me by the abb busoni and by lord wilmore by that friend and that enemy one thing appears certain and clear in my opinion that in no period in no case in no circumstance could there have been any contact between him and me but villefort uttered words which even he himself did not believe he dreaded not so much the revelation for he could reply to or deny its truth he cared little for that mene mene tekel upharsin which appeared suddenly in letters of blood upon the wall but what he was really anxious for was to discover whose hand had traced them while he was
