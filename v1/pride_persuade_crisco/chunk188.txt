of condolence had been sent to ireland the neglect had been visited on the head of the sinner for when poor lady elliot died herself no letter of condolence was received at kellynch and consequently there was but too much reason to apprehend that the dalrymples considered the relationship as closed how to have this anxious business set to rights and be admitted as cousins again was the question and it was a question which in a more rational manner neither lady russell nor mr elliot thought unimportant family connexions were always worth preserving good company always worth seeking lady dalrymple had taken a house for three months in laura place and would be living in style she had been at bath the year before and lady russell had heard her spoken of as a charming woman it was very desirable that the connexion should be renewed if it could be done without any compromise of propriety on the side of the elliots sir walter however would choose his own means and at last wrote a very fine letter of ample explanation regret and entreaty to his right honourable cousin neither lady russell nor mr elliot could admire the letter but it did all that was wanted in bringing three lines of scrawl from the dowager viscountess she was very much honoured and should be happy in their acquaintance the toils of the business were over the sweets began they visited in laura place they had the cards of dowager viscountess dalrymple and the honourable miss carteret to be arranged wherever they might be most visible and our cousins in laura place--our cousin lady dalrymple and miss carteret were talked of to everybody anne was ashamed had lady dalrymple and her daughter even been very agreeable she would still have been ashamed of the agitation they created but they were nothing there was no superiority of manner accomplishment or understanding lady dalrymple had acquired the name of a charming woman because she had a smile and a civil answer for everybody miss carteret with still less to say was so plain and so awkward that she would never have been tolerated in camden place but for her birth lady russell confessed she had expected something better but yet it was an acquaintance worth having and when anne ventured to speak her opinion of them to mr elliot he agreed to their being nothing in themselves but still maintained that as a family connexion as good company as those who would collect good company around them they had their value anne smiled and said my idea of good company mr elliot is the company of clever well-informed people who have a great deal of conversation that is what i call good company you are mistaken said he gently that is not good company that is the best good company requires only birth education and manners and with regard to education is not very nice birth and good manners are essential but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing in good company on the contrary it will do very well my cousin anne shakes her head she is not satisfied she is fastidious my dear cousin sitting down by her you have a better right to be fastidious than almost any other woman i know but will it answer will it make you happy will it not be wiser to accept the society of those good ladies in laura place and enjoy all the advantages of the connexion as far as possible you may depend upon it that they will move in the first set in bath this winter and as rank is rank your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family our family let me say in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for yes sighed anne we shall indeed be known to be related to them then recollecting herself and not wishing to be answered she added i certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to procure the acquaintance i suppose smiling i have more pride than any of you but i confess it does vex me that we should be so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them pardon me dear cousin you are unjust in your own claims in london perhaps in your present quiet style of living it might be as you say but in bath sir walter elliot and his family will always be worth knowing always acceptable as acquaintance well said anne i certainly am proud too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon place i love your indignation said he it is very natural but here you are in bath and the object is to be established here with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to sir walter elliot you talk of being proud i am called proud i know and i shall not wish to believe myself otherwise for our pride if investigated would have the same object i have no doubt though the kind may seem a little different in one point i am sure my dear cousin he continued speaking lower though there was no one else in the room in one point i am
