spirit there is not much to choose between the language of either party but what did m danglars say to this outburst on the part of the procureur oh he laughed and in that singular manner so peculiar to himself half-malicious half-ferocious he almost immediately got up and took his leave then for the first time i observed the agitation of my grandfather and i must tell you maximilian that i am the only person capable of discerning emotion in his paralyzed frame and i suspected that the conversation that had been carried on in his presence for they always say and do what they like before the dear old man without the smallest regard for his feelings had made a strong impression on his mind for naturally enough it must have pained him to hear the emperor he so devotedly loved and served spoken of in that depreciating manner the name of m noirtier interposed maximilian is celebrated throughout europe he was a statesman of high standing and you may or may not know valentine that he took a leading part in every bonapartist conspiracy set on foot during the restoration of the bourbons oh i have often heard whispers of things that seem to me most strange the father a bonapartist the son a royalist what can have been the reason of so singular a difference in parties and politics but to resume my story i turned towards my grandfather as though to question him as to the cause of his emotion he looked expressively at the newspaper i had been reading what is the matter dear grandfather said i are you pleased he gave me a sign in the affirmative with what my father said just now he returned a sign in the negative perhaps you liked what m danglars said another sign in the negative oh then you were glad to hear that m morrel i didnt dare to say maximilian had been made an officer of the legion of honor he signified assent only think of the poor old mans being so pleased to think that you who were a perfect stranger to him had been made an officer of the legion of honor perhaps it was a mere whim on his part for he is falling they say into second childhood but i love him for showing so much interest in you how singular murmured maximilian your father hates me while your grandfather on the contrary what strange feelings are aroused by politics hush cried valentine suddenly someone is coming maximilian leaped at one bound into his crop of lucern which he began to pull up in the most ruthless way under the pretext of being occupied in weeding it mademoiselle mademoiselle exclaimed a voice from behind the trees madame is searching for you everywhere there is a visitor in the drawing-room a visitor inquired valentine much agitated who is it some grand personage a prince i believe they said the count of monte cristo i will come directly cried valentine aloud the name of monte cristo sent an electric shock through the young man on the other side of the iron gate to whom valentines i am coming was the customary signal of farewell now then said maximilian leaning on the handle of his spade i would give a good deal to know how it comes about that the count of monte cristo is acquainted with m de villefort chapter toxicology it was really the count of monte cristo who had just arrived at madame de villeforts for the purpose of returning the procureurs visit and at his name as may be easily imagined the whole house was in confusion madame de villefort who was alone in her drawing-room when the count was announced desired that her son might be brought thither instantly to renew his thanks to the count and edward who heard this great personage talked of for two whole days made all possible haste to come to him not from obedience to his mother or out of any feeling of gratitude to the count but from sheer curiosity and that some chance remark might give him the opportunity for making one of the impertinent speeches which made his mother say oh that naughty child but i cant be severe with him he is really so bright after the usual civilities the count inquired after m de villefort my husband dines with the chancellor replied the young lady he has just gone and i am sure hell be exceedingly sorry not to have had the pleasure of seeing you before he went two visitors who were there when the count arrived having gazed at him with all their eyes retired after that reasonable delay which politeness admits and curiosity requires what is your sister valentine doing inquired madame de villefort of edward tell someone to bid her come here that i may have the honor of introducing her to the count you have a daughter then madame inquired the count very young i presume the daughter of m de villefort by his first marriage replied the young wife a fine well-grown girl but melancholy interrupted master edward snatching the feathers out of the tail of a splendid paroquet that was screaming on its gilded perch in order to make a plume for his hat madame de villefort merely cried be still edward she
