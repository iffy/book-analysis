intention of christening marrying and burying his parishioners whenever it were required he must be an oddity i think said she i cannot make him out there is something very pompous in his style and what can he mean by apologising for being next in the entail we cannot suppose he would help it if he could could he be a sensible man sir no my dear i think not i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse there is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter which promises well i am impatient to see him in point of composition said mary the letter does not seem defective the idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well expressed to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour as for their mother mr collinss letter had done away much of her ill-will and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters mr collins was punctual to his time and was received with great politeness by the whole family mr bennet indeed said little but the ladies were ready enough to talk and mr collins seemed neither in need of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself he was a tall heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty his air was grave and stately and his manners were very formal he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs bennet on having so fine a family of daughters said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth and added that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers but mrs bennet who quarreled with no compliments answered most readily you are very kind i am sure and i wish with all my heart it may prove so for else they will be destitute enough things are settled so oddly you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate ah sir i do indeed it is a grievous affair to my poor girls you must confess not that i mean to find fault with you for such things i know are all chance in this world there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed i am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousins and could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them at present i will not say more but perhaps when we are better acquainted he was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on each other they were not the only objects of mr collinss admiration the hall the dining-room and all its furniture were examined and praised and his commendation of everything would have touched mrs bennets heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property the dinner too in its turn was highly admired and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was owing but he was set right there by mrs bennet who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen he begged pardon for having displeased her in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour chapter during dinner mr bennet scarcely spoke at all but when the servants were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness lady catherine de bourghs attention to his wishes and consideration for his comfort appeared very remarkable mr bennet could not have chosen better mr collins was eloquent in her praise the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension as he had himself experienced from lady catherine she had been graciously pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings and had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew but he had never seen anything but affability in her she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations
