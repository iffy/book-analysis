with the count perceived his father watching for his arrival behind a curtain and turned aside the counts eye expanded he knew albert had insulted the count dreadfully and that in every country in the world such an insult would lead to a deadly duel albert returned safely then the count was revenged an indescribable ray of joy illumined that wretched countenance like the last ray of the sun before it disappears behind the clouds which bear the aspect not of a downy couch but of a tomb but as we have said he waited in vain for his son to come to his apartment with the account of his triumph he easily understood why his son did not come to see him before he went to avenge his fathers honor but when that was done why did not his son come and throw himself into his arms it was then when the count could not see albert that he sent for his servant who he knew was authorized not to conceal anything from him ten minutes afterwards general morcerf was seen on the steps in a black coat with a military collar black pantaloons and black gloves he had apparently given previous orders for as he reached the bottom step his carriage came from the coach-house ready for him the valet threw into the carriage his military cloak in which two swords were wrapped and shutting the door he took his seat by the side of the coachman the coachman stooped down for his orders to the champs-lyses said the general the count of monte cristos hurry the horses bounded beneath the whip and in five minutes they stopped before the counts door m de morcerf opened the door himself and as the carriage rolled away he passed up the walk rang and entered the open door with his servant a moment afterwards baptistin announced the count of morcerf to monte cristo and the latter leading hayde aside ordered that morcerf be asked into the drawing-room the general was pacing the room the third time when in turning he perceived monte cristo at the door ah it is m de morcerf said monte cristo quietly i thought i had not heard aright yes it is i said the count whom a frightful contraction of the lips prevented from articulating freely may i know the cause which procures me the pleasure of seeing m de morcerf so early had you not a meeting with my son this morning asked the general i had replied the count and i know my son had good reasons to wish to fight with you and to endeavor to kill you yes sir he had very good ones but you see that in spite of them he has not killed me and did not even fight yet he considered you the cause of his fathers dishonor the cause of the fearful ruin which has fallen on my house it is true sir said monte cristo with his dreadful calmness a secondary cause but not the principal doubtless you made then some apology or explanation i explained nothing and it is he who apologized to me but to what do you attribute this conduct to the conviction probably that there was one more guilty than i and who was that his father that may be said the count turning pale but you know the guilty do not like to find themselves convicted i know it and i expected this result you expected my son would be a coward cried the count m albert de morcerf is no coward said monte cristo a man who holds a sword in his hand and sees a mortal enemy within reach of that sword and does not fight is a coward why is he not here that i may tell him so sir replied monte cristo coldly i did not expect that you had come here to relate to me your little family affairs go and tell m albert that and he may know what to answer you oh no no said the general smiling faintly i did not come for that purpose you are right i came to tell you that i also look upon you as my enemy i came to tell you that i hate you instinctively that it seems as if i had always known you and always hated you and in short since the young people of the present day will not fight it remains for us to do so do you think so sir certainly and when i told you i had foreseen the result it is the honor of your visit i alluded to so much the better are you prepared yes sir you know that we shall fight till one of us is dead said the general whose teeth were clenched with rage m until one of us dies repeated monte cristo moving his head slightly up and down let us start then we need no witnesses very true said monte cristo it is unnecessary we know each other so well on the contrary said the count we know so little of each other indeed said monte cristo with the same indomitable coolness let us see are you not the soldier fernand who deserted on the eve of the battle of waterloo are you not the lieutenant fernand who served as guide and spy
