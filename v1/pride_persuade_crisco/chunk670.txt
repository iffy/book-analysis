brigadier some traveller seems impatient said the host what number was it that rang number run waiter at this moment the screams and ringing were redoubled aha said the brigadier stopping the servant the person who is ringing appears to want something more than a waiter we will attend upon him with a gendarme who occupies number the little fellow who arrived last night in a post-chaise with his sister and who asked for an apartment with two beds the bell here rang for the third time with another shriek of anguish follow me mr commissary said the brigadier tread in my steps wait an instant said the host number has two staircases inside and outside good said the brigadier i will take charge of the inside one are the carbines loaded yes brigadier well you guard the exterior and if he attempts to fly fire upon him he must be a great criminal from what the telegraph says the brigadier followed by the commissary disappeared by the inside staircase accompanied by the noise which his assertions respecting andrea had excited in the crowd this is what had happened andrea had very cleverly managed to descend two-thirds of the chimney but then his foot slipped and notwithstanding his

awakened by the noise and fixing their eyes upon the spot whence the sound proceeded they saw a man one of these ladies the fair one uttered those terrible shrieks which resounded through the house while the other rushing to the bell-rope rang with all her strength andrea as we can see was surrounded by misfortune for pitys sake he cried pale and bewildered without seeing whom he was addressing for pitys sake do not call assistance save me i will not harm you andrea the murderer cried one of the ladies eugnie mademoiselle danglars exclaimed andrea stupefied help help cried mademoiselle darmilly taking the bell from her companions hand and ringing it yet more violently save me i am pursued said andrea clasping his hands for pity for mercys sake do not deliver me up it is too late they are coming said eugnie well conceal me somewhere you can say you were needlessly alarmed you can turn their suspicions and save my life m the two ladies pressing closely to one another and drawing the bedclothes tightly around them remained silent to this supplicating voice repugnance and fear taking possession of their minds well be it so at length said eugnie return by the same road

andrea shuddered and looked on the young girl with an expression which proved how little he understood such ferocious honor kill myself he cried throwing down his knife why should i do so why you said
