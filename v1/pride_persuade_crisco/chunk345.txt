m august rolled by in unceasing efforts on the part of morrel to renew his credit or revive the old on the th of august it was known at marseilles that he had left town in the mailcoach and then it was said that the bills would go to protest at the end of the month and that morrel had gone away and left his chief clerk emmanuel and his cashier cocles to meet the creditors but contrary to all expectation when the st of august came the house opened as usual and cocles appeared behind the grating of the counter examined all bills presented with the usual scrutiny and from first to last paid all with the usual precision there came in moreover two drafts which m morrel had fully anticipated and which cocles paid as punctually as the bills which the shipowner had accepted all this was incomprehensible and then with the tenacity peculiar to prophets of bad news the failure was put off until the end of september on the st morrel returned he was awaited by his family with extreme anxiety for from this journey to paris they hoped great things morrel had thought of danglars who was now immensely rich and had lain under great obligations to morrel in former days since to him it was owing that danglars entered the service of the spanish banker with whom he had laid the foundations of his vast wealth it was said at this moment that danglars was worth from six to eight millions of francs and had unlimited credit danglars then without taking a crown from his pocket could save morrel he had but to pass his word for a loan and morrel was saved morrel had long thought of danglars but had kept away from some instinctive motive and had delayed as long as possible availing himself of this last resource and morrel was right for he returned home crushed by the humiliation of a refusal yet on his arrival morrel did not utter a complaint or say one harsh word he embraced his weeping wife and daughter pressed emmanuels hand with friendly warmth and then going to his private room on the second floor had sent for cocles then said the two women to emmanuel we are indeed ruined it was agreed in a brief council held among them that julie should write to her brother who was in garrison at nmes to come to them as speedily as possible the poor women felt instinctively that they required all their strength to support the blow that impended besides maximilian morrel though hardly two-and-twenty had great influence over his father he was a strong-minded upright young man at the time when he decided on his profession his father had no desire to choose for him but had consulted young maximilians taste he had at once declared for a military life and had in consequence studied hard passed brilliantly through the polytechnic school and left it as sub-lieutenant of the rd of the line for a year he had held this rank and expected promotion on the first vacancy in his regiment maximilian morrel was noted for his rigid observance not only of the obligations imposed on a soldier but also of the duties of a man and he thus gained the name of the stoic we need hardly say that many of those who gave him this epithet repeated it because they had heard it and did not even know what it meant this was the young man whom his mother and sister called to their aid to sustain them under the serious trial which they felt they would soon have to endure they had not mistaken the gravity of this event for the moment after morrel had entered his private office with cocles julie saw the latter leave it pale trembling and his features betraying the utmost consternation she would have questioned him as he passed by her but the worthy creature hastened down the staircase with unusual precipitation and only raised his hands to heaven and exclaimed oh mademoiselle mademoiselle what a dreadful misfortune who could ever have believed it a moment afterwards julie saw him go upstairs carrying two or three heavy ledgers a portfolio and a bag of money morrel examined the ledgers opened the portfolio and counted the money all his funds amounted to or francs his bills receivable up to the th to or which making the best of everything gave him francs to meet debts amounting to francs he had not even the means for making a possible settlement on account however when morrel went down to his dinner he appeared very calm this calmness was more alarming to the two women than the deepest dejection would have been after dinner morrel usually went out and used to take his coffee at the club of the phocens and read the semaphore this day he did not leave the house but returned to his office as to cocles he seemed completely bewildered for part of the day he went into the courtyard seated himself on a stone with his head bare and exposed to the blazing sun emmanuel tried to comfort the women but his eloquence faltered the young man was too well acquainted with the business of the house not to feel that a great catastrophe hung over the morrel
