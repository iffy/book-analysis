living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him the gardiners stayed a week at longbourn and what with the phillipses the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its engagement mrs bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family dinner when the engagement was for home some of the officers always made part of it of which officers mr wickham was sure to be one and on these occasions mrs gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeths warm commendation narrowly observed them both without supposing them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment to mrs gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure unconnected with his general powers about ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged they had therefore many acquaintances in common and though wickham had been little there since the death of darcys father it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring mrs gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late mr darcy by character perfectly well here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham could give and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor she was delighting both him and herself on being made acquainted with the present mr darcys treatment of him she tried to remember some of that gentlemans reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it and was confident at last that she recollected having heard mr fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud ill-natured boy chapter mrs gardiners caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone after honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly seriously i would have you be on your guard do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent i have nothing to say against him he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he ought to have i should think you could not do better but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you you have sense and we all expect you to use it your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct i am sure you must not disappoint your father my dear aunt this is being serious indeed yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise well then you need not be under any alarm i will take care of myself and of mr wickham too he shall not be in love with me if i can prevent it elizabeth you are not serious now i beg your pardon i will try again at present i am not in love with mr wickham no i certainly am not but he is beyond all comparison the most agreeable man i ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me i believe it will be better that he should not i see the imprudence of it oh that abominable mr darcy my fathers opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it my father however is partial to mr wickham in short my dear aunt i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but since we see every day that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist all that i can promise you therefore is not to be in a hurry i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object when i am in company with him i will not be wishing in short i will do my best perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him as i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile very true it will be wise in me to refrain from that but do not imagine that he is always here so often it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week you know my mothers ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends but really and upon my honour i will try to do what
