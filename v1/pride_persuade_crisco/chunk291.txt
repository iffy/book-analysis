evidence that could at all have criminated me what the accusation no the letter are you sure i saw it done that alters the case this man might after all be a greater scoundrel than you have thought possible upon my word said dants you make me shudder is the world filled with tigers and crocodiles yes and remember that two-legged tigers and crocodiles are more dangerous than the others never mind let us go on with all my heart you tell me he burned the letter he did saying at the same time you see i thus destroy the only proof existing against you this action is somewhat too sublime to be natural you think so i am sure of it to whom was this letter addressed to m noirtier rue coq-hron no paris now can you conceive of any interest that your heroic deputy could possibly have had in the destruction of that letter why it is not altogether impossible he might have had for he made me promise several times never to speak of that letter to anyone assuring me he so advised me for my own interest and more than this he insisted on my taking a solemn oath never to utter the name mentioned in the address noirtier repeated the abb noirtier i knew a person of that name at the court of the queen of etruria a noirtier who had been a girondin during the revolution what was your deputy called de villefort the abb burst into a fit of laughter while dants gazed on him in utter astonishment what ails you said he at length do you see that ray of sunlight i do well the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to you poor fellow poor young man and you tell me this magistrate expressed great sympathy and commiseration for you he did and the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter yes and then made you swear never to utter the name of noirtier yes why you poor short-sighted simpleton can you not guess who this noirtier was whose very name he was so careful to keep concealed this noirtier was his father had a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of dants or hell opened its yawning gulf before him he could not have been more completely transfixed with horror than he was at the sound of these unexpected words starting up he clasped his hands around his head as though to prevent his very brain from bursting and exclaimed his father his father yes his father replied the abb his right name was noirtier de villefort at this instant a bright light shot through the mind of dants and cleared up all that had been dark and obscure before the change that had come over villefort during the examination the destruction of the letter the exacted promise the almost supplicating tones of the magistrate who seemed rather to implore mercy than to pronounce punishment all returned with a stunning force to his memory he cried out and staggered against the wall like a drunken man then he hurried to the opening that led from the abbs cell to his own and said i must be alone to think over all this when he regained his dungeon he threw himself on his bed where the turnkey found him in the evening visit sitting with fixed gaze and contracted features dumb and motionless as a statue during these hours of profound meditation which to him had seemed only minutes he had formed a fearful resolution and bound himself to its fulfilment by a solemn oath dants was at length roused from his reverie by the voice of faria who having also been visited by his jailer had come to invite his fellow-sufferer to share his supper the reputation of being out of his mind though harmlessly and even amusingly so had procured for the abb unusual privileges he was supplied with bread of a finer whiter quality than the usual prison fare and even regaled each sunday with a small quantity of wine now this was a sunday and the abb had come to ask his young companion to share the luxuries with him dants followed him his features were no longer contracted and now wore their usual expression but there was that in his whole appearance that bespoke one who had come to a fixed and desperate resolve faria bent on him his penetrating eye i regret now said he having helped you in your late inquiries or having given you the information i did why so inquired dants because it has instilled a new passion in your heart that of vengeance dants smiled let us talk of something else said he again the abb looked at him then mournfully shook his head but in accordance with dants request he began to speak of other matters the elder prisoner was one of those persons whose conversation like that of all who have experienced many trials contained many useful and important hints as well as sound information but it was never egotistical for the unfortunate man never alluded to his own sorrows dants listened with admiring attention to all he said some of his remarks corresponded with what he already knew or applied to the sort of knowledge his nautical life had enabled him to acquire a part of the
