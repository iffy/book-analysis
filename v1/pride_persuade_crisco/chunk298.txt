eyes of spada was that of his nephew in full costume and csar borgia paying him most marked attentions spada turned pale as csar looked at him with an ironical air which proved that he had anticipated all and that the snare was well spread they began dinner and spada was only able to inquire of his nephew if he had received his message the nephew replied no perfectly comprehending the meaning of the question it was too late for he had already drunk a glass of excellent wine placed for him expressly by the popes butler spada at the same moment saw another bottle approach him which he was pressed to taste an hour afterwards a physician declared they were both poisoned through eating mushrooms spada died on the threshold of the vineyard the nephew expired at his own door making signs which his wife could not comprehend then csar and the pope hastened to lay hands on the heritage under pretense of seeking for the papers of the dead man but the inheritance consisted in this only a scrap of paper on which spada had written i bequeath to my beloved nephew my coffers my books and amongst others my breviary with the gold corners which i beg he will preserve in remembrance of his affectionate uncle the heirs sought everywhere admired the breviary laid hands on the furniture and were greatly astonished that spada the rich man was really the most miserable of uncles no treasures unless they were those of science contained in the library and laboratories that was all csar and his father searched examined scrutinized but found nothing or at least very little not exceeding a few thousand crowns in plate and about the same in ready money but the nephew had time to say to his wife before he expired look well among my uncles papers there is a will they sought even more thoroughly than the august heirs had done but it was fruitless there were two palaces and a vineyard behind the palatine hill but in these days landed property had not much value and the two palaces and the vineyard remained to the family since they were beneath the rapacity of the pope and his son months and years rolled on alexander vi died poisoned you know by what mistake csar poisoned at the same time escaped by shedding his skin like a snake but the new skin was spotted by the poison till it looked like a tigers then compelled to quit rome he went and got himself obscurely killed in a night skirmish scarcely noticed in history after the popes death and his sons exile it was supposed that the spada family would resume the splendid position they had held before the cardinals time but this was not the case the spadas remained in doubtful ease a mystery hung over this dark affair and the public rumor was that csar a better politician than his father had carried off from the pope the fortune of the two cardinals i say the two because cardinal rospigliosi who had not taken any precaution was completely despoiled up to this point said faria interrupting the thread of his narrative this seems to you very meaningless no doubt eh oh my friend cried dants on the contrary it seems as if i were reading a most interesting narrative go on i beg of you i will the family began to get accustomed to their obscurity years rolled on and amongst the descendants some were soldiers others diplomatists some churchmen some bankers some grew rich and some were ruined i come now to the last of the family whose secretary i was the count of spada i had often heard him complain of the disproportion of his rank with his fortune and i advised him to invest all he had in an annuity he did so and thus doubled his income the celebrated breviary remained in the family and was in the counts possession it had been handed down from father to son for the singular clause of the only will that had been found had caused it to be regarded as a genuine relic preserved in the family with superstitious veneration it was an illuminated book with beautiful gothic characters and so weighty with gold that a servant always carried it before the cardinal on days of great solemnity at the sight of papers of all sorts titles contracts parchments which were kept in the archives of the family all descending from the poisoned cardinal i in my turn examined the immense bundles of documents like twenty servitors stewards secretaries before me but in spite of the most exhaustive researches i found nothing yet i had read i had even written a precise history of the borgia family for the sole purpose of assuring myself whether any increase of fortune had occurred to them on the death of the cardinal csar spada but could only trace the acquisition of the property of the cardinal rospigliosi his companion in misfortune i was then almost assured that the inheritance had neither profited the borgias nor the family but had remained unpossessed like the treasures of the arabian nights which slept in the bosom of the earth under the eyes of the genie i searched ransacked counted calculated a thousand and a thousand times the income and
