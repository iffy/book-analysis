to give any information as to the state of his finances ask of me as mayor what is my opinion of m morrel and i shall say that he is a man honorable to the last degree and who has up to this time fulfilled every engagement with scrupulous punctuality this is all i can say sir if you wish to learn more address yourself to m de boville the inspector of prisons no rue de nouailles he has i believe two hundred thousand francs in morrels hands and if there be any grounds for apprehension as this is a greater amount than mine you will most probably find him better informed than myself the englishman seemed to appreciate this extreme delicacy made his bow and went away proceeding with a characteristic british stride towards the street mentioned m de boville was in his private room and the englishman on perceiving him made a gesture of surprise which seemed to indicate that it was not the first time he had been in his presence as to m de boville he was in such a state of despair that it was evident all the faculties of his mind absorbed in the thought which occupied him at the moment did not allow either his memory or his imagination to stray to the past the englishman with the coolness of his nation addressed him in terms nearly similar to those with which he had accosted the mayor of marseilles oh sir exclaimed m de boville your fears are unfortunately but too well founded and you see before you a man in despair i had two hundred thousand francs placed in the hands of morrel son these two hundred thousand francs were the dowry of my daughter who was to be married in a fortnight and these two hundred thousand francs were payable half on the th of this month and the other half on the th of next month i had informed m morrel of my desire to have these payments punctually and he has been here within the last half-hour to tell me that if his ship the pharaon did not come into port on the th he would be wholly unable to make this payment but said the englishman this looks very much like a suspension of payment it looks more like bankruptcy exclaimed m de boville despairingly the englishman appeared to reflect a moment and then said from which it would appear sir that this credit inspires you with considerable apprehension to tell you the truth i consider it lost well then i will buy it of you you yes i but at a tremendous discount of course no for two hundred thousand francs our house added the englishman with a laugh does not do things in that way and you will pay ready money m and the englishman drew from his pocket a bundle of bank-notes which might have been twice the sum m de boville feared to lose a ray of joy passed across m de bovilles countenance yet he made an effort at self-control and said sir i ought to tell you that in all probability you will not realize six per cent of this sum thats no affair of mine replied the englishman that is the affair of the house of thomson french in whose name i act they have perhaps some motive to serve in hastening the ruin of a rival firm but all i know sir is that i am ready to hand you over this sum in exchange for your assignment of the debt i only ask a brokerage of course that is perfectly just cried m de boville the commission is usually one and a half will you have two three five per cent or even more whatever you say sir replied the englishman laughing i am like my house and do not do such things no the commission i ask is quite different name it sir i beg you are the inspector of prisons i have been so these fourteen years you keep the registers of entries and departures i do to these registers there are added notes relative to the prisoners there are special reports on every prisoner well sir i was educated at rome by a poor devil of an abb who disappeared suddenly i have since learned that he was confined in the chteau dif and i should like to learn some particulars of his death what was his name the abb faria oh i recollect him perfectly cried m de boville he was crazy so they said oh he was decidedly very possibly but what sort of madness was it he pretended to know of an immense treasure and offered vast sums to the government if they would liberate him poor devil and he is dead yes sir five or six months ago last february you have a good memory sir to recollect dates so well i recollect this because the poor devils death was accompanied by a singular incident may i ask what that was said the englishman with an expression of curiosity which a close observer would have been astonished at discovering in his phlegmatic countenance oh dear yes sir the abbs dungeon was forty or fifty feet distant from that of one of bonapartes emissaries one of those who had contributed the most to the return
