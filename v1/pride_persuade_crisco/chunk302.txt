his cell one night edmond awoke suddenly believing that he heard someone calling him he opened his eyes upon utter darkness his name or rather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name reached him he sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow undoubtedly the call came from farias dungeon alas murmured edmond can it be he moved his bed drew up the stone rushed into the passage and reached the opposite extremity the secret entrance was open by the light of the wretched and wavering lamp of which we have spoken dants saw the old man pale but yet erect clinging to the bedstead his features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he already knew and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them for the first time alas my dear friend said faria in a resigned tone you understand do you not and i need not attempt to explain to you edmond uttered a cry of agony and quite out of his senses rushed towards the door exclaiming help help faria had just sufficient strength to restrain him silence he said or you are lost we must now only think of you my dear friend and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your flight possible it would require years to do again what i have done here and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew we had communicated with each other besides be assured my dear edmond the dungeon i am about to leave will not long remain empty some other unfortunate being will soon take my place and to him you will appear like an angel of salvation perhaps he will be young strong and enduring like yourself and will aid you in your escape while i have been but a hindrance you will no longer have half a dead body tied to you as a drag to all your movements at length providence has done something for you he restores to you more than he takes away and it was time i should die edmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim oh my friend my friend speak not thus and then resuming all his presence of mind which had for a moment staggered under this blow and his strength which had failed at the words of the old man he said oh i have saved you once and i will save you a second time and raising the foot of the bed he drew out the phial still a third filled with the red liquor see he exclaimed there remains still some of the magic draught quick quick tell me what i must do this time are there any fresh instructions speak my friend i listen there is not a hope replied faria shaking his head but no matter god wills it that man whom he has created and in whose heart he has so profoundly rooted the love of life should do all in his power to preserve that existence which however painful it may be is yet always so dear oh yes yes exclaimed dants and i tell you that i will save you yet well then try the cold gains upon me i feel the blood flowing towards my brain these horrible chills which make my teeth chatter and seem to dislocate my bones begin to pervade my whole frame in five minutes the malady will reach its height and in a quarter of an hour there will be nothing left of me but a corpse oh exclaimed dants his heart wrung with anguish do as you did before only do not wait so long all the springs of life are now exhausted in me and death he continued looking at his paralyzed arm and leg has but half its work to do if after having made me swallow twelve drops instead of ten you see that i do not recover then pour the rest down my throat now lift me on my bed for i can no longer support myself edmond took the old man in his arms and laid him on the bed and now my dear friend said faria sole consolation of my wretched existence you whom heaven gave me somewhat late but still gave me a priceless gift and for which i am most grateful at the moment of separating from you forever i wish you all the happiness and all the prosperity you so well deserve my son i bless thee the young man cast himself on his knees leaning his head against the old mans bed listen now to what i say in this my dying moment the treasure of the spadas exists god grants me the boon of vision unrestricted by time or space i see it in the depths of the inner cavern my eyes pierce the inmost recesses of the earth and are dazzled at the sight of so much riches if you do escape remember that the poor abb whom all the world called mad was not so hasten to monte cristo avail yourself of the fortune for you have indeed suffered long enough a violent convulsion attacked the old man dants raised his head and saw farias eyes injected with blood it seemed as if a flow of blood had ascended from the chest to the head
