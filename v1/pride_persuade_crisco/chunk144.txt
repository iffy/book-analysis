and self-denying principally for his advantage was her chief consolation under the misery of a parting a final parting and every consolation was required for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions on his side totally unconvinced and unbending and of his feeling himself ill used by so forced a relinquishment he had left the country in consequence a few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance but not with a few months ended anne's share of suffering from it her attachment and regrets had for a long time clouded every enjoyment of youth and an early loss of bloom and spirits had been their lasting effect more than seven years were gone since this little history of sorrowful interest had reached its close and time had softened down much perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him but she had been too dependent on time alone no aid had been given in change of place except in one visit to bath soon after the rupture or in any novelty or enlargement of society no one had ever come within the kellynch circle who could bear a comparison with frederick wentworth as he stood in her memory no second attachment the only thoroughly natural happy and sufficient cure at her time of life had been possible to the nice tone of her mind the fastidiousness of her taste in the small limits of the society around them she had been solicited when about two-and-twenty to change her name by the young man who not long afterwards found a more willing mind in her younger sister and lady russell had lamented her refusal for charles musgrove was the eldest son of a man whose landed property and general importance were second in that country only to sir walter's and of good character and appearance and however lady russell might have asked yet for something more while anne was nineteen she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty-two so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of her father's house and settled so permanently near herself but in this case anne had left nothing for advice to do and though lady russell as satisfied as ever with her own discretion never wished the past undone she began now to have the anxiety which borders on hopelessness for anne's being tempted by some man of talents and independence to enter a state for which she held her to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits they knew not each other's opinion either its constancy or its change on the one leading point of anne's conduct for the subject was never alluded to but anne at seven-and-twenty thought very differently from what she had been made to think at nineteen she did not blame lady russell she did not blame herself for having been guided by her but she felt that were any young person in similar circumstances to apply to her for counsel they would never receive any of such certain immediate wretchedness such uncertain future good she was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home and every anxiety attending his profession all their probable fears delays and disappointments she should yet have been a happier woman in maintaining the engagement than she had been in the sacrifice of it and this she fully believed had the usual share had even more than the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs without reference to the actual results of their case which as it happened would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be reasonably calculated on all his sanguine expectations all his confidence had been justified his genius and ardour had seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path he had very soon after their engagement ceased got employ and all that he had told her would follow had taken place he had distinguished himself and early gained the other step in rank and must now by successive captures have made a handsome fortune she had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority but she could not doubt his being rich and in favour of his constancy she had no reason to believe him married how eloquent could anne elliot have been how eloquent at least were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment and a cheerful confidence in futurity against that over-anxious caution which seems to insult exertion and distrust providence she had been forced into prudence in her youth she learned romance as she grew older the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning with all these circumstances recollections and feelings she could not hear that captain wentworth's sister was likely to live at kellynch without a revival of former pain and many a stroll and many a sigh were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea she often told herself it was folly before she could harden her nerves sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the crofts and their business no evil she was assisted however by that perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness among the only three of her own friends in the secret of the past which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it she could do justice to the superiority of lady russell's motives in this over those of her father and elizabeth she could honour all the better
