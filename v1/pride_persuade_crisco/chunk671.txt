not see she could hear and the sneers of the crowd reached her in the carriage oh why is not the world a wilderness she exclaimed throwing herself into the arms of mademoiselle darmilly her eyes sparkling with the same kind of rage which made nero wish that the roman world had but one neck that he might sever it at a single blow the next day they stopped at the htel de flandre at brussels the same evening andrea was incarcerated in the conciergerie chapter the law we have seen how quietly mademoiselle danglars and mademoiselle darmilly accomplished their transformation and flight the fact being that everyone was too much occupied in his or her own affairs to think of theirs we will leave the banker contemplating the enormous magnitude of his debt before the phantom of bankruptcy and follow the baroness who after being momentarily crushed under the weight of the blow which had struck her had gone to seek her usual adviser lucien debray the baroness had looked forward to this marriage as a means of ridding her of a guardianship which over a girl of eugnies character could not fail to be rather a troublesome undertaking for in the tacit relations which maintain the bond of family union the mother to maintain her ascendancy over her daughter must never fail to be a model of wisdom and a type of perfection now madame danglars feared eugnies sagacity and the influence of mademoiselle darmilly she had frequently observed the contemptuous expression with which her daughter looked upon debray an expression which seemed to imply that she understood all her mothers amorous and pecuniary relationships with the intimate secretary moreover she saw that eugnie detested debray not only because he was a source of dissension and scandal under the paternal roof but because she had at once classed him in that catalogue of bipeds whom plato endeavors to withdraw from the appellation of men and whom diogenes designated as animals upon two legs without feathers unfortunately in this world of ours each person views things through a certain medium and so is prevented from seeing in the same light as others and madame danglars therefore very much regretted that the marriage of eugnie had not taken place not only because the match was good and likely to insure the happiness of her child but because it would also set her at liberty she ran therefore to debray who after having like the rest of paris witnessed the contract scene and the scandal attending it had retired in haste to his club where he was chatting with some friends upon the events which served as a subject of conversation for three-fourths of that city known as the capital of the world at the precise time when madame danglars dressed in black and concealed in a long veil was ascending the stairs leading to debrays apartments notwithstanding the assurances of the concierge that the young man was not at home debray was occupied in repelling the insinuations of a friend who tried to persuade him that after the terrible scene which had just taken place he ought as a friend of the family to marry mademoiselle danglars and her two millions debray did not defend himself very warmly for the idea had sometimes crossed his mind still when he recollected the independent proud spirit of eugnie he positively rejected it as utterly impossible though the same thought again continually recurred and found a resting-place in his heart tea play and the conversation which had become interesting during the discussion of such serious affairs lasted till one oclock in the morning meanwhile madame danglars veiled and uneasy awaited the return of debray in the little green room seated between two baskets of flowers which she had that morning sent and which it must be confessed debray had himself arranged and watered with so much care that his absence was half excused in the eyes of the poor woman at twenty minutes to twelve madame danglars tired of waiting returned home women of a certain grade are like prosperous grisettes in one respect they seldom return home after twelve oclock the baroness returned to the hotel with as much caution as eugnie used in leaving it she ran lightly upstairs and with an aching heart entered her apartment contiguous as we know to that of eugnie she was fearful of exciting any remark and believed firmly in her daughters innocence and fidelity to the paternal roof she listened at eugnies door and hearing no sound tried to enter but the bolts were in place madame danglars then concluded that the young girl had been overcome with the terrible excitement of the evening and had gone to bed and to sleep she called the maid and questioned her mademoiselle eugnie said the maid retired to her apartment with mademoiselle darmilly they then took tea together after which they desired me to leave saying that they needed me no longer since then the maid had been below and like everyone else she thought the young ladies were in their own room madame danglars therefore went to bed without a shadow of suspicion and began to muse over the recent events in proportion as her memory became clearer the occurrences of the evening were revealed in their true light what she had taken for confusion was a
