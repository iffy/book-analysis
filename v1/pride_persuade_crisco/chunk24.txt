the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street on distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual civilities bingley was the principal spokesman and miss bennet the principal object he was then he said on his way to longbourn on purpose to enquire after her mr darcy corroborated it with a bow and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting both changed colour one looked white the other red mr wickham after a few moments touched his hat a salutation which mr darcy just deigned to return what could be the meaning of it it was impossible to imagine it was impossible not to long to know in another minute mr bingley but without seeming to have noticed what passed took leave and rode on with his friend mr denny and mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr phillips house and then made their bows in spite of miss lydias pressing entreaties that they should come in and even in spite of mrs phillipss throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation mrs phillips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldest from their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as their own carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing about if she had not happened to see mr joness shop-boy in the street who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away when her civility was claimed towards mr collins by janes introduction of him she received him with her very best politeness which he returned with as much more apologising for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with her which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice mrs phillips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by exclamations and enquiries about the other of whom however she could only tell her nieces what they already knew that mr denny had brought him from london and that he was to have a lieutenants commission in the shire she had been watching him the last hour she said as he walked up and down the street and had mr wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the officers who in comparison with the stranger were become stupid disagreeable fellows some of them were to dine with the phillipses the next day and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr wickham and give him an invitation also if the family from longbourn would come in the evening this was agreed to and mrs phillips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets and a little bit of hot supper afterwards the prospect of such delights was very cheering and they parted in mutual good spirits mr collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless as they walked home elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen but though jane would have defended either or both had they appeared to be in the wrong she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister mr collins on his return highly gratified mrs bennet by admiring mrs phillipss manners and politeness he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman for she had not only received him with the utmost civility but even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening although utterly unknown to her before something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life chapter as no objection was made to the young peoples engagement with their aunt and all mr collinss scruples of leaving mr and mrs bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton and the girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the drawing-room that mr wickham had accepted their uncles invitation and was then in the house when this information was given and they had all taken their seats mr collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour
