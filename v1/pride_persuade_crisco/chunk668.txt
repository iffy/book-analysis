andrea had not spoken without cause of the pretty rooms looking out upon the court of the bell hotel which with its triple galleries like those of a theatre with the jessamine and clematis twining round the light columns forms one of the prettiest entrances to an inn that you can imagine the fowl was tender the wine old the fire clear and sparkling and andrea was surprised to find himself eating with as good an appetite as though nothing had happened then he went to bed and almost immediately fell into that deep sleep which is sure to visit men of twenty years of age even when they are torn with remorse now here we are obliged to own that andrea ought to have felt remorse but that he did not this was the plan which had appealed to him to afford the best chance of his security before daybreak he would awake leave the inn after rigorously paying his bill and reaching the forest he would under pretence of making studies in painting test the hospitality of some peasants procure himself the dress of a woodcutter and a hatchet casting off the lions skin to assume that of the woodman then with his hands covered with dirt his hair darkened by means of a leaden comb his complexion embrowned with a preparation for which one of his old comrades had given him the recipe he intended by following the wooded districts to reach the nearest frontier walking by night and sleeping in the day in the forests and quarries and only entering inhabited regions to buy a loaf from time to time once past the frontier andrea proposed making money of his diamonds and by uniting the proceeds to ten bank-notes he always carried about with him in case of accident he would then find himself possessor of about livres which he philosophically considered as no very deplorable condition after all moreover he reckoned much on the interest of the danglars to hush up the rumor of their own misadventures these were the reasons which added to the fatigue caused andrea to sleep so soundly in order that he might wake early he did not close the shutters but contented himself with bolting the door and placing on the table an unclasped and long-pointed knife whose temper he well knew and which was never absent from him about seven in the morning andrea was awakened by a ray of sunlight which played warm and brilliant upon his face in all well-organized brains the predominating idea and there always is one is sure to be the last thought before sleeping and the first upon waking in the morning andrea had scarcely opened his eyes when his predominating idea presented itself and whispered in his ear that he had slept too long he jumped out of bed and ran to the window a gendarme was crossing the court a gendarme is one of the most striking objects in the world even to a man void of uneasiness but for one who has a timid conscience and with good cause too the yellow blue and white uniform is really very alarming why is that gendarme there asked andrea of himself then all at once he replied with that logic which the reader has doubtless remarked in him there is nothing astonishing in seeing a gendarme at an inn instead of being astonished let me dress myself and the youth dressed himself with a facility his valet de chambre had failed to rob him of during the two months of fashionable life he had led in paris now then said andrea while dressing himself ill wait till he leaves and then ill slip away m and saying this andrea who had now put on his boots and cravat stole gently to the window and a second time lifted up the muslin curtain not only was the first gendarme still there but the young man now perceived a second yellow blue and white uniform at the foot of the staircase the only one by which he could descend while a third on horseback holding a musket in his fist was posted as a sentinel at the great street-door which alone afforded the means of egress the appearance of the third gendarme settled the matter for a crowd of curious loungers was extended before him effectually blocking the entrance to the hotel theyre after me was andreas first thought diable a pallor overspread the young mans forehead and he looked around him with anxiety his room like all those on the same floor had but one outlet to the gallery in the sight of everybody i am lost was his second thought and indeed for a man in andreas situation an arrest meant the assizes trial and death death without mercy or delay for a moment he convulsively pressed his head within his hands and during that brief period he became nearly mad with terror but soon a ray of hope glimmered in the multitude of thoughts which bewildered his mind and a faint smile played upon his white lips and pallid cheeks he looked around and saw the objects of his search upon the chimney-piece they were a pen ink and paper with forced composure he dipped the pen in the ink and wrote the following lines upon a sheet of paper i have no
