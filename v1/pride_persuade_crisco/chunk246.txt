both edmond and yourself had i divulged my own apprehensions to a soul i am too well aware that though a subordinate like myself is bound to acquaint the shipowner with everything that occurs there are many things he ought most carefully to conceal from all else tis well danglars tis well replied m morrel you are a worthy fellow and i had already thought of your interests in the event of poor edmond having become captain of the pharaon is it possible you were so kind yes indeed i had previously inquired of dants what was his opinion of you and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your post for somehow i have perceived a sort of coolness between you and what was his reply that he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair which he merely referred to without entering into particulars but that whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ships owners would have his preference also the hypocrite murmured danglars poor dants said caderousse no one can deny his being a noble-hearted young fellow but meanwhile continued m morrel here is the pharaon without a captain oh replied danglars since we cannot leave this port for the next three months let us hope that ere the expiration of that period dants will be set at liberty no doubt but in the meantime i am entirely at your service m morrel answered danglars you know that i am as capable of managing a ship as the most experienced captain in the service and it will be so far advantageous to you to accept my services that upon edmonds release from prison no further change will be requisite on board the pharaon than for dants and myself each to resume our respective posts thanks danglars that will smooth over all difficulties i fully authorize you at once to assume the command of the pharaon and look carefully to the unloading of her freight private misfortunes must never be allowed to interfere with business be easy on that score m morrel but do you think we shall be permitted to see our poor edmond i will let you know that directly i have seen m de villefort whom i shall endeavor to interest in edmonds favor i am aware he is a furious royalist but in spite of that and of his being kings attorney he is a man like ourselves and i fancy not a bad sort of one perhaps not replied danglars but i hear that he is ambitious and thats rather against him well well returned m morrel we shall see but now hasten on board i will join you there ere long so saying the worthy shipowner quitted the two allies and proceeded in the direction of the palais de justice m you see said danglars addressing caderousse the turn things have taken do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence not the slightest but yet it seems to me a shocking thing that a mere joke should lead to such consequences but who perpetrated that joke let me ask neither you nor myself but fernand you knew very well that i threw the paper into a corner of the room indeed i fancied i had destroyed it oh no replied caderousse that i can answer for you did not i only wish i could see it now as plainly as i saw it lying all crushed and crumpled in a corner of the arbor well then if you did depend upon it fernand picked it up and either copied it or caused it to be copied perhaps even he did not take the trouble of recopying it and now i think of it by heavens he may have sent the letter itself fortunately for me the handwriting was disguised then you were aware of dants being engaged in a conspiracy not i as i before said i thought the whole thing was a joke nothing more it seems however that i have unconsciously stumbled upon the truth still argued caderousse i would give a great deal if nothing of the kind had happened or at least that i had had no hand in it you will see danglars that it will turn out an unlucky job for both of us nonsense if any harm come of it it should fall on the guilty person and that you know is fernand how can we be implicated in any way all we have got to do is to keep our own counsel and remain perfectly quiet not breathing a word to any living soul and you will see that the storm will pass away without in the least affecting us amen responded caderousse waving his hand in token of adieu to danglars and bending his steps towards the alles de meilhan moving his head to and fro and muttering as he went after the manner of one whose mind was overcharged with one absorbing idea so far then said danglars mentally all has gone as i would have it i am temporarily commander of the pharaon with the certainty of being permanently so if that fool of a caderousse can be persuaded to hold his tongue my only fear is the chance of dants being released but there he is in the hands of
