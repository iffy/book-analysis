do you not know that we italians have eyes only for the man we love true replied franz all i can say is continued the countess taking up the lorgnette and directing it toward the box in question that the gentleman whose history i am unable to furnish seems to me as though he had just been dug up he looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly grave-digger to quit his tomb for a while and revisit this earth of ours than anything human how ghastly pale he is oh he is always as colorless as you now see him said franz then you know him almost screamed the countess oh pray do for heavens sake tell us all about is he a vampire or a resuscitated corpse or what i fancy i have seen him before and i even think he recognizes me and i can well understand said the countess shrugging up her beautiful shoulders as though an involuntary shudder passed through her veins that those who have once seen that man will never be likely to forget him the sensation experienced by franz was evidently not peculiar to himself another and wholly uninterested person felt the same unaccountable awe and misgiving well inquired franz after the countess had a second time directed her lorgnette at the box what do you think of our opposite neighbor m why that he is no other than lord ruthven himself in a living form this fresh allusion to byron drew a smile to franzs countenance although he could but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before him i must positively find out who and what he is said franz rising from his seat no no cried the countess you must not leave me i depend upon you to escort me home oh indeed i cannot permit you to go is it possible whispered franz that you entertain any fear ill tell you answered the countess byron had the most perfect belief in the existence of vampires and even assured me that he had seen them the description he gave me perfectly corresponds with the features and character of the man before us oh he is the exact personification of what i have been led to expect the coal-black hair large bright glittering eyes in which a wild unearthly fire seems burning the same ghastly paleness then observe too that the woman with him is altogether unlike all others of her sex she is a foreigner a stranger nobody knows who she is or where she comes from no doubt she belongs to the same horrible race he does and is like himself a dealer in magical arts i entreat of you not to go near him at least tonight and if tomorrow your curiosity still continues as great pursue your researches if you will but tonight you neither can nor shall for that purpose i mean to keep you all to myself franz protested he could not defer his pursuit till the following day for many reasons listen to me said the countess and do not be so very headstrong i am going home i have a party at my house tonight and therefore cannot possibly remain till the end of the opera now i cannot for one instant believe you so devoid of gallantry as to refuse a lady your escort when she even condescends to ask you for it there was nothing else left for franz to do but to take up his hat open the door of the box and offer the countess his arm it was quite evident by her manner that her uneasiness was not feigned and franz himself could not resist a feeling of superstitious dread so much the stronger in him as it arose from a variety of corroborative recollections while the terror of the countess sprang from an instinctive belief originally created in her mind by the wild tales she had listened to till she believed them truths franz could even feel her arm tremble as he assisted her into the carriage upon arriving at her hotel franz perceived that she had deceived him when she spoke of expecting company on the contrary her own return before the appointed hour seemed greatly to astonish the servants excuse my little subterfuge said the countess in reply to her companions half-reproachful observation on the subject but that horrid man had made me feel quite uncomfortable and i longed to be alone that i might compose my startled mind franz essayed to smile nay said she do not smile it ill accords with the expression of your countenance and i am sure it does not spring from your heart however promise me one thing what is it promise me i say i will do anything you desire except relinquish my determination of finding out who this man is i have more reasons than you can imagine for desiring to know who he is from whence he came and whither he is going where he comes from i am ignorant but i can readily tell you where he is going to and that is down below without the least doubt let us only speak of the promise you wished me to make said franz well then
