will be pardoned we are not generally very severe with the austrians in short you will find your father a very presentable person i assure you ah sir you have given me confidence it is so long since we were separated that i have not the least remembrance of him and besides you know that in the eyes of the world a large fortune covers all defects he is a millionaire his income is francs then said the young man with anxiety i shall be sure to be placed in an agreeable position one of the most agreeable possible my dear sir he will allow you an income of livres per annum during the whole time of your stay in paris then in that case i shall always choose to remain there you cannot control circumstances my dear sir man proposes and god disposes andrea sighed but said he so long as i do remain in paris and nothing forces me to quit it do you mean to tell me that i may rely on receiving the sum you just now mentioned to me you may shall i receive it from my father asked andrea with some uneasiness yes you will receive it from your father personally but lord wilmore will be the security for the money he has at the request of your father opened an account of francs a month at m danglars which is one of the safest banks in paris and does my father mean to remain long in paris asked andrea only a few days replied monte cristo his service does not allow him to absent himself more than two or three weeks together ah my dear father exclaimed andrea evidently charmed with the idea of his speedy departure therefore said monte cristo feigning to mistake his meaning therefore i will not for another instant retard the pleasure of your meeting are you prepared to embrace your worthy father i hope you do not doubt it m go then into the drawing-room my young friend where you will find your father awaiting you andrea made a low bow to the count and entered the adjoining room monte cristo watched him till he disappeared and then touched a spring in a panel made to look like a picture which in sliding partly from the frame discovered to view a small opening so cleverly contrived that it revealed all that was passing in the drawing-room now occupied by cavalcanti and andrea the young man closed the door behind him and advanced towards the major who had risen when he heard steps approaching him ah my dear father said andrea in a loud voice in order that the count might hear him in the next room is it really you how do you do my dear son said the major gravely after so many years of painful separation said andrea in the same tone of voice and glancing towards the door what a happiness it is to meet again indeed it is after so long a separation will you not embrace me sir said andrea m if you wish it my son said the major and the two men embraced each other after the fashion of actors on the stage that is to say each rested his head on the others shoulder then we are once more reunited said andrea once more replied the major never more to be separated why as to that i think my dear son you must be by this time so accustomed to france as to look upon it almost as a second country the fact is said the young man that i should be exceedingly grieved to leave it as for me you must know i cannot possibly live out of lucca therefore i shall return to italy as soon as i can but before you leave france my dear father i hope you will put me in possession of the documents which will be necessary to prove my descent certainly i am come expressly on that account it has cost me much trouble to find you but i had resolved on giving them into your hands and if i had to recommence my search it would occupy all the few remaining years of my life where are these papers then here they are andrea seized the certificate of his fathers marriage and his own baptismal register and after having opened them with all the eagerness which might be expected under the circumstances he read them with a facility which proved that he was accustomed to similar documents and with an expression which plainly denoted an unusual interest in the contents when he had perused the documents an indefinable expression of pleasure lighted up his countenance and looking at the major with a most peculiar smile he said in very excellent tuscan then there is no longer any such thing in italy as being condemned to the galleys the major drew himself up to his full height why what do you mean by that question i mean that if there were it would be impossible to draw up with impunity two such deeds as these in france my dear sir half such a piece of effrontery as that would cause you to be quickly despatched to toulon for five years for change of air will you be good enough to explain your meaning said
