was no look calculated to reassure her all it seemed to say was it is not only your reserve which afflicts me what is it then asked the young girl perhaps you think i shall abandon you dear grandpapa and that i shall forget you when i am married no they told you then that m dpinay consented to our all living together yes then why are you still vexed and grieved the old mans eyes beamed with an expression of gentle affection yes i understand said valentine it is because you love me the old man assented and you are afraid i shall be unhappy yes you do not like m franz the eyes repeated several times no no no then you are vexed with the engagement yes well listen said valentine throwing herself on her knees and putting her arm round her grandfathers neck i am vexed too for i do not love m franz dpinay an expression of intense joy illumined the old mans eyes when i wished to retire into a convent you remember how angry you were with me a tear trembled in the eye of the invalid well continued valentine the reason of my proposing it was that i might escape this hateful marriage which drives me to despair noirtiers breathing came thick and short then the idea of this marriage really grieves you too ah if you could but help me if we could both together defeat their plan but you are unable to oppose them you whose mind is so quick and whose will is so firm are nevertheless as weak and unequal to the contest as i am myself alas you who would have been such a powerful protector to me in the days of your health and strength can now only sympathize in my joys and sorrows without being able to take any active part in them however this is much and calls for gratitude and heaven has not taken away all my blessings when it leaves me your sympathy and kindness at these words there appeared in noirtiers eye an expression of such deep meaning that the young girl thought she could read these words there you are mistaken i can still do much for you do you think you can help me dear grandpapa said valentine yes noirtier raised his eyes it was the sign agreed on between him and valentine when he wanted anything what is it you want dear grandpapa said valentine and she endeavored to recall to mind all the things which he would be likely to need and as the ideas presented themselves to her mind she repeated them aloud then finding that all her efforts elicited nothing but a constant no she said come since this plan does not answer i will have recourse to another she then recited all the letters of the alphabet from a down to n when she arrived at that letter the paralytic made her understand that she had spoken the initial letter of the thing he wanted ah said valentine the thing you desire begins with the letter n it is with n that we have to do then well let me see what can you want that begins with n na ne ni no yes yes yes said the old mans eye ah it is no then yes valentine fetched a dictionary which she placed on a desk before noirtier she opened it and seeing that the old mans eye was thoroughly fixed on its pages she ran her finger quickly up and down the columns during the six years which had passed since noirtier first fell into this sad state valentines powers of invention had been too often put to the test not to render her expert in devising expedients for gaining a knowledge of his wishes and the constant practice had so perfected her in the art that she guessed the old mans meaning as quickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he wanted at the word notary noirtier made a sign to her to stop m notary said she do you want a notary dear grandpapa the old man again signified that it was a notary he desired you would wish a notary to be sent for then said valentine yes shall my father be informed of your wish yes do you wish the notary to be sent for immediately yes then they shall go for him directly dear grandpapa is that all you want yes valentine rang the bell and ordered the servant to tell monsieur or madame de villefort that they were requested to come to m noirtiers room are you satisfied now inquired valentine yes i am sure you are it is not very difficult to discover that and the young girl smiled on her grandfather as if he had been a child m de villefort entered followed by barrois what do you want me for sir demanded he of the paralytic sir said valentine my grandfather wishes for a notary at this strange and unexpected demand m de villefort and his father exchanged looks yes motioned the latter with a firmness which seemed to declare that with the help of valentine and his old servant who both knew what his wishes were he was quite prepared to maintain the contest do you wish for a notary
