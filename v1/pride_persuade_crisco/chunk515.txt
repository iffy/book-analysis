ma foi who is to know perhaps it is some political difference my father and the baron dpinay lived in the stormy times of which i only saw the ending said villefort was not your father a bonapartist asked monte cristo i think i remember that you told me something of that kind my father has been a jacobin more than anything else said villefort carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence and the senators robe which napoleon cast on his shoulders only served to disguise the old man without in any degree changing him when my father conspired it was not for the emperor it was against the bourbons for m noirtier possessed this peculiarity he never projected any utopian schemes which could never be realized but strove for possibilities and he applied to the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories of the mountain theories that never shrank from any means that were deemed necessary to bring about the desired result well said monte cristo it is just as i thought it was politics which brought noirtier and m dpinay into personal contact although general dpinay served under napoleon did he not still retain royalist sentiments and was he not the person who was assassinated one evening on leaving a bonapartist meeting to which he had been invited on the supposition that he favored the cause of the emperor villefort looked at the count almost with terror am i mistaken then said monte cristo no sir the facts were precisely what you have stated said madame de villefort and it was to prevent the renewal of old feuds that m de villefort formed the idea of uniting in the bonds of affection the two children of these inveterate enemies it was a sublime and charitable thought said monte cristo and the whole world should applaud it it would be noble to see mademoiselle noirtier de villefort assuming the title of madame franz dpinay villefort shuddered and looked at monte cristo as if he wished to read in his countenance the real feelings which had dictated the words he had just uttered but the count completely baffled the procureur and prevented him from discovering anything beneath the never-varying smile he was so constantly in the habit of assuming although said villefort it will be a serious thing for valentine to lose her grandfathers fortune i do not think that m dpinay will be frightened at this pecuniary loss he will perhaps hold me in greater esteem than the money itself seeing that i sacrifice everything in order to keep my word with him besides he knows that valentine is rich in right of her mother and that she will in all probability inherit the fortune of m and madame de saint-mran her mothers parents who both love her tenderly and who are fully as well worth loving and tending as m noirtier said madame de villefort besides they are to come to paris in about a month and valentine after the affront she has received need not consider it necessary to continue to bury herself alive by being shut up with m noirtier the count listened with satisfaction to this tale of wounded self-love and defeated ambition but it seems to me said monte cristo and i must begin by asking your pardon for what i am about to say that if m noirtier disinherits mademoiselle de villefort because she is going to marry a man whose father he detested he cannot have the same cause of complaint against this dear edward true said madame de villefort with an intonation of voice which it is impossible to describe is it not unjust shamefully unjust poor edward is as much m noirtiers grandchild as valentine and yet if she had not been going to marry m franz m noirtier would have left her all his money and supposing valentine to be disinherited by her grandfather she will still be three times richer than he the count listened and said no more count said villefort we will not entertain you any longer with our family misfortunes it is true that my patrimony will go to endow charitable institutions and my father will have deprived me of my lawful inheritance without any reason for doing so but i shall have the satisfaction of knowing that i have acted like a man of sense and feeling m dpinay to whom i had promised the interest of this sum shall receive it even if i endure the most cruel privations however said madame de villefort returning to the one idea which incessantly occupied her mind perhaps it would be better to explain this unlucky affair to m dpinay in order to give him the opportunity of himself renouncing his claim to the hand of mademoiselle de villefort ah that would be a great pity said villefort a great pity said monte cristo undoubtedly said villefort moderating the tones of his voice a marriage once concerted and then broken off throws a sort of discredit on a young lady then again the old reports which i was so anxious to put an end to will instantly gain ground no it will all go well m dpinay if he is an honorable man will consider himself more than ever pledged to mademoiselle de villefort unless he were actuated by a decided feeling of avarice but that
