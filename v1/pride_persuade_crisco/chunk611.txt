de monte cristo is apprised that this night a man will enter his house in the champs-lyses with the intention of carrying off some papers supposed to be in the secretaire in the dressing-room the counts well-known courage will render unnecessary the aid of the police whose interference might seriously affect him who sends this advice the count by any opening from the bedroom or by concealing himself in the dressing-room would be able to defend his property himself many attendants or apparent precautions would prevent the villain from the attempt and m de monte cristo would lose the opportunity of discovering an enemy whom chance has revealed to him who now sends this warning to the count a warning he might not be able to send another time if this first attempt should fail and another be made the counts first idea was that this was an artifice a gross deception to draw his attention from a minor danger in order to expose him to a greater he was on the point of sending the letter to the commissary of police notwithstanding the advice of his anonymous friend or perhaps because of that advice when suddenly the idea occurred to him that it might be some personal enemy whom he alone should recognize and over whom if such were the case he alone would gain any advantage as fiesco had done over the moor who would have killed him we know the counts vigorous and daring mind denying anything to be impossible with that energy which marks the great man from his past life from his resolution to shrink from nothing the count had acquired an inconceivable relish for the contests in which he had engaged sometimes against nature that is to say against god and sometimes against the world that is against the devil they do not want my papers said monte cristo they want to kill me they are no robbers but assassins i will not allow the prefect of police to interfere with my private affairs i am rich enough forsooth to distribute his authority on this occasion the count recalled baptistin who had left the room after delivering the letter return to paris said he assemble the servants who remain there i want all my household at auteuil but will no one remain in the house my lord asked baptistin yes the porter my lord will remember that the lodge is at a distance from the house well the house might be stripped without his hearing the least noise by whom by thieves you are a fool m baptistin thieves might strip the house it would annoy me less than to be disobeyed baptistin bowed m you understand me said the count bring your comrades here one and all but let everything remain as usual only close the shutters of the ground floor and those of the first floor you know they are never closed go the count signified his intention of dining alone and that no one but ali should attend him having dined with his usual tranquillity and moderation the count making a signal to ali to follow him went out by the side-gate and on reaching the bois de boulogne turned apparently without design towards paris and at twilight found himself opposite his house in the champs-lyses all was dark one solitary feeble light was burning in the porters lodge about forty paces distant from the house as baptistin had said monte cristo leaned against a tree and with that scrutinizing glance which was so rarely deceived looked up and down the avenue examined the passers-by and carefully looked down the neighboring streets to see that no one was concealed ten minutes passed thus and he was convinced that no one was watching him he hastened to the side-door with ali entered hurriedly and by the servants staircase of which he had the key gained his bedroom without opening or disarranging a single curtain without even the porter having the slightest suspicion that the house which he supposed empty contained its chief occupant arrived in his bedroom the count motioned to ali to stop then he passed into the dressing-room which he examined everything appeared as usual the precious secretaire in its place and the key in the secretaire he double locked it took the key returned to the bedroom door removed the double staple of the bolt and went in meanwhile ali had procured the arms the count required namely a short carbine and a pair of double-barrelled pistols with which as sure an aim might be taken as with a single-barrelled one thus armed the count held the lives of five men in his hands it was about half-past nine the count and ali ate in haste a crust of bread and drank a glass of spanish wine then monte cristo slipped aside one of the movable panels which enabled him to see into the adjoining room he had within his reach his pistols and carbine and ali standing near him held one of the small arabian hatchets whose form has not varied since the crusades through one of the windows of the bedroom on a line with that in the dressing-room the count could see into the street two hours passed thus it was intensely
