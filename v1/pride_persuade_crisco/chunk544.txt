himself is he not a count what can i know of him he calls himself so i of course give him the same title and everyone else does likewise what a strange man you are what next you say m danglars dined here yes with count cavalcanti the marquis his father madame danglars m and madame de villefort charming people m debray maximilian morrel and m de chteau-renaud did they speak of me not a word so much the worse why so i thought you wished them to forget you if they did not speak of me i am sure they thought about me and i am in despair how will that affect you since mademoiselle danglars was not among the number here who thought of you truly she might have thought of you at home i have no fear of that or if she did it was only in the same way in which i think of her touching sympathy so you hate each other said the count listen said morcerf if mademoiselle danglars were disposed to take pity on my supposed martyrdom on her account and would dispense with all matrimonial formalities between our two families i am ready to agree to the arrangement in a word mademoiselle danglars would make a charming mistress but a wife diable and this said monte cristo is your opinion of your intended spouse yes it is rather unkind i acknowledge but it is true but as this dream cannot be realized since mademoiselle danglars must become my lawful wife live perpetually with me sing to me compose verses and music within ten paces of me and that for my whole life it frightens me one may forsake a mistress but a wife good heavens there she must always be and to marry mademoiselle danglars would be awful you are difficult to please viscount yes for i often wish for what is impossible what is that to find such a wife as my father found monte cristo turned pale and looked at albert while playing with some magnificent pistols your father was fortunate then said he you know my opinion of my mother count look at her still beautiful witty more charming than ever for any other son to have stayed with his mother for four days at trport it would have been a condescension or a martyrdom while i return more contented more peaceful shall i say more poetic than if i had taken queen mab or titania as my companion m that is an overwhelming demonstration and you would make everyone vow to live a single life such are my reasons for not liking to marry mademoiselle danglars have you ever noticed how much a thing is heightened in value when we obtain possession of it the diamond which glittered in the window at marls or fossins shines with more splendor when it is our own but if we are compelled to acknowledge the superiority of another and still must retain the one that is inferior do you not know what we have to endure worldling murmured the count thus i shall rejoice when mademoiselle eugnie perceives i am but a pitiful atom with scarcely as many hundred thousand francs as she has millions monte cristo smiled one plan occurred to me continued albert franz likes all that is eccentric i tried to make him fall in love with mademoiselle danglars but in spite of four letters written in the most alluring style he invariably answered my eccentricity may be great but it will not make me break my promise that is what i call devoted friendship to recommend to another one whom you would not marry yourself albert smiled apropos continued he franz is coming soon but it will not interest you you dislike him i think i said monte cristo my dear viscount how have you discovered that i did not like m franz i like everyone and you include me in the expression everyone many thanks let us not mistake said monte cristo i love everyone as god commands us to love our neighbor as christians but i thoroughly hate but a few let us return to m franz dpinay did you say he was coming yes summoned by m de villefort who is apparently as anxious to get mademoiselle valentine married as m danglars is to see mademoiselle eugnie settled it must be a very irksome office to be the father of a grown-up daughter it seems to make one feverish and to raise ones pulse to ninety beats a minute until the deed is done but m dpinay unlike you bears his misfortune patiently still more he talks seriously about the matter puts on a white tie and speaks of his family he entertains a very high opinion of m and madame de villefort which they deserve do they not i believe they do m de villefort has always passed for a severe but a just man there is then one said monte cristo whom you do not condemn like poor danglars because i am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps replied albert laughing indeed my dear sir said monte cristo you are revoltingly foppish i foppish how do you mean yes pray take a cigar and cease to defend yourself and to struggle to escape marrying mademoiselle danglars let things take their course perhaps you
