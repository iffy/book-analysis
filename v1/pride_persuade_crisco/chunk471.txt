and happiness for which i would cheerfully have surrendered ten years of my life at the small cost of francs per annum paid quarterly henceforth we have nothing to fear i am on my own ground and have an undoubted right to place a ladder against the wall and to look over when i please without having any apprehensions of being taken off by the police as a suspicious character i may also enjoy the precious privilege of assuring you of my fond faithful and unalterable affection whenever you visit your favorite bower unless indeed it offends your pride to listen to professions of love from the lips of a poor workingman clad in a blouse and cap a faint cry of mingled pleasure and surprise escaped from the lips of valentine who almost instantly said in a saddened tone as though some envious cloud darkened the joy which illumined her heart alas no maximilian this must not be for many reasons we should presume too much on our own strength and like others perhaps be led astray by our blind confidence in each others prudence how can you for an instant entertain so unworthy a thought dear valentine have i not from the first blessed hour of our acquaintance schooled all my words and actions to your sentiments and ideas and you have i am sure the fullest confidence in my honor when you spoke to me of experiencing a vague and indefinite sense of coming danger i placed myself blindly and devotedly at your service asking no other reward than the pleasure of being useful to you and have i ever since by word or look given you cause of regret for having selected me from the numbers that would willingly have sacrificed their lives for you you told me my dear valentine that you were engaged to m dpinay and that your father was resolved upon completing the match and that from his will there was no appeal as m de villefort was never known to change a determination once formed i kept in the background as you wished and waited not for the decision of your heart or my own but hoping that providence would graciously interpose in our behalf and order events in our favor but what cared i for delays or difficulties valentine as long as you confessed that you loved me and took pity on me if you will only repeat that avowal now and then i can endure anything ah maximilian that is the very thing that makes you so bold and which renders me at once so happy and unhappy that i frequently ask myself whether it is better for me to endure the harshness of my stepmother and her blind preference for her own child or to be as i now am insensible to any pleasure save such as i find in these meetings so fraught with danger to both i will not admit that word returned the young man it is at once cruel and unjust is it possible to find a more submissive slave than myself you have permitted me to converse with you from time to time valentine but forbidden my ever following you in your walks or elsewhere have i not obeyed and since i found means to enter this enclosure to exchange a few words with you through this gate to be close to you without really seeing you have i ever asked so much as to touch the hem of your gown or tried to pass this barrier which is but a trifle to one of my youth and strength never has a complaint or a murmur escaped me i have been bound by my promises as rigidly as any knight of olden times come come dearest valentine confess that what i say is true lest i be tempted to call you unjust m it is true said valentine as she passed the end of her slender fingers through a small opening in the planks and permitted maximilian to press his lips to them and you are a true and faithful friend but still you acted from motives of self-interest my dear maximilian for you well knew that from the moment in which you had manifested an opposite spirit all would have been ended between us you promised to bestow on me the friendly affection of a brother for i have no friend but yourself upon earth who am neglected and forgotten by my father harassed and persecuted by my stepmother and left to the sole companionship of a paralyzed and speechless old man whose withered hand can no longer press mine and who can speak to me with the eye alone although there still lingers in his heart the warmest tenderness for his poor grandchild oh how bitter a fate is mine to serve either as a victim or an enemy to all who are stronger than myself while my only friend and supporter is a living corpse indeed indeed maximilian i am very miserable and if you love me it must be out of pity valentine replied the young man deeply affected i will not say you are all i love in the world for i dearly prize my sister and brother-in-law but my affection for them is calm and tranquil in no manner resembling what i feel for you when i think of
