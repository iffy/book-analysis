of the usurper in a very resolute and very dangerous man indeed said the englishman yes replied m de boville i myself had occasion to see this man in or and we could only go into his dungeon with a file of soldiers that man made a deep impression on me i shall never forget his countenance m the englishman smiled imperceptibly and you say sir he interposed that the two dungeons were separated by a distance of fifty feet but it appears that this edmond dants this dangerous mans name was edmond dants it appears sir that this edmond dants had procured tools or made them for they found a tunnel through which the prisoners held communication with one another this tunnel was dug no doubt with an intention of escape no doubt but unfortunately for the prisoners the abb faria had an attack of catalepsy and died that must have cut short the projects of escape for the dead man yes replied m de boville but not for the survivor on the contrary this dants saw a means of accelerating his escape he no doubt thought that prisoners who died in the chteau dif were interred in an ordinary burial-ground and he conveyed the dead man into his own cell took his place in the sack in which they had sewed up the corpse and awaited the moment of interment it was a bold step and one that showed some courage remarked the englishman as i have already told you sir he was a very dangerous man and fortunately by his own act disembarrassed the government of the fears it had on his account how was that how do you not comprehend no the chteau dif has no cemetery and they simply throw the dead into the sea after fastening a thirty-six-pound cannon-ball to their feet well observed the englishman as if he were slow of comprehension well they fastened a thirty-six-pound ball to his feet and threw him into the sea really exclaimed the englishman yes sir continued the inspector of prisons you may imagine the amazement of the fugitive when he found himself flung headlong over the rocks i should like to have seen his face at that moment that would have been difficult no matter replied de boville in supreme good-humor at the certainty of recovering his two hundred thousand francs no matter i can fancy it and he shouted with laughter so can i said the englishman and he laughed too but he laughed as the english do at the end of his teeth and so continued the englishman who first gained his composure he was drowned unquestionably so that the governor got rid of the dangerous and the crazy prisoner at the same time precisely m but some official document was drawn up as to this affair i suppose inquired the englishman yes yes the mortuary deposition you understand dants relations if he had any might have some interest in knowing if he were dead or alive so that now if there were anything to inherit from him they may do so with easy conscience he is dead and no mistake about it oh yes and they may have the fact attested whenever they please so be it said the englishman but to return to these registers true this story has diverted our attention from them excuse me excuse you for what for the story by no means it really seems to me very curious yes indeed so sir you wish to see all relating to the poor abb who really was gentleness itself yes you will much oblige me go into my study here and i will show it to you and they both entered m de bovilles study everything was here arranged in perfect order each register had its number each file of papers its place the inspector begged the englishman to seat himself in an armchair and placed before him the register and documents relative to the chteau dif giving him all the time he desired for the examination while de boville seated himself in a corner and began to read his newspaper the englishman easily found the entries relative to the abb faria but it seemed that the history which the inspector had related interested him greatly for after having perused the first documents he turned over the leaves until he reached the deposition respecting edmond dants there he found everything arranged in due order the accusation examination morrels petition m de villeforts marginal notes he folded up the accusation quietly and put it as quietly in his pocket read the examination and saw that the name of noirtier was not mentioned in it perused too the application dated th april in which morrel by the deputy procureurs advice exaggerated with the best intentions for napoleon was then on the throne the services dants had rendered to the imperial cause services which villeforts certificates rendered indisputable then he saw through the whole thing this petition to napoleon kept back by villefort had become under the second restoration a terrible weapon against him in the hands of the kings attorney he was no longer astonished when he searched on to find in the register this note placed in a bracket against his name edmond dants an inveterate bonapartist took an active part in the return from the island of elba to be
