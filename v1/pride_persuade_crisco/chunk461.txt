and have never dared to raise your wings into those upper spheres which god has peopled with invisible or exceptional beings and you allow then sir that spheres exist and that these marked and invisible beings mingle amongst us why should they not can you see the air you breathe and yet without which you could not for a moment exist then we do not see those beings to whom you allude yes we do you see them whenever god pleases to allow them to assume a material form you touch them come in contact with them speak to them and they reply to you ah said villefort smiling i confess i should like to be warned when one of these beings is in contact with me you have been served as you desire monsieur for you were warned just now and i now again warn you then you yourself are one of these marked beings yes monsieur i believe so for until now no man has found himself in a position similar to mine the dominions of kings are limited either by mountains or rivers or a change of manners or an alteration of language my kingdom is bounded only by the world for i am not an italian or a frenchman or a hindu or an american or a spaniard i am a cosmopolite no country can say it saw my birth god alone knows what country will see me die i adopt all customs speak all languages you believe me to be a frenchman for i speak french with the same facility and purity as yourself well ali my nubian believes me to be an arab bertuccio my steward takes me for a roman hayde my slave thinks me a greek you may therefore comprehend that being of no country asking no protection from any government acknowledging no man as my brother not one of the scruples that arrest the powerful or the obstacles which paralyze the weak paralyzes or arrests me i have only two adversaries i will not say two conquerors for with perseverance i subdue even them they are time and distance there is a third and the most terrible that is my condition as a mortal being this alone can stop me in my onward career before i have attained the goal at which i aim for all the rest i have reduced to mathematical terms what men call the chances of fate namely ruin change circumstances i have fully anticipated and if any of these should overtake me yet it will not overwhelm me unless i die i shall always be what i am and therefore it is that i utter the things you have never heard even from the mouths of kings for kings have need and other persons have fear of you for who is there who does not say to himself in a society as incongruously organized as ours perhaps some day i shall have to do with the kings attorney but can you not say that sir the moment you become an inhabitant of france you are naturally subjected to the french law i know it sir replied monte cristo but when i visit a country i begin to study by all the means which are available the men from whom i may have anything to hope or to fear till i know them as well as perhaps better than they know themselves it follows from this that the kings attorney be he who he may with whom i should have to deal would assuredly be more embarrassed than i should that is to say replied villefort with hesitation that human nature being weak every man according to your creed has committed faults faults or crimes responded monte cristo with a negligent air and that you alone amongst the men whom you do not recognize as your brothers for you have said so observed villefort in a tone that faltered somewhat you alone are perfect no not perfect was the counts reply only impenetrable thats all but let us leave off this strain sir if the tone of it is displeasing to you i am no more disturbed by your justice than are you by my second-sight no no by no means said villefort who was afraid of seeming to abandon his ground no by your brilliant and almost sublime conversation you have elevated me above the ordinary level we no longer talk we rise to dissertation but you know how the theologians in their collegiate chairs and philosophers in their controversies occasionally say cruel truths let us suppose for the moment that we are theologizing in a social way or even philosophically and i will say to you rude as it may seem my brother you sacrifice greatly to pride you may be above others but above you there is god m above us all sir was monte cristos response in a tone and with an emphasis so deep that villefort involuntarily shuddered i have my pride for men serpents always ready to threaten everyone who would pass without crushing them under foot but i lay aside that pride before god who has taken me from nothing to make me what i am then count i admire you said villefort who for the first time in this strange conversation used the aristocratic form to the unknown personage whom until
