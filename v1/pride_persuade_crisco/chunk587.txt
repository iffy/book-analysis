and her sympathetic accent and the melancholy expression of her countenance at once charmed and horrified him as to hayde these terrible reminiscences seemed to have overpowered her for a moment for she ceased speaking her head leaning on her hand like a beautiful flower bowing beneath the violence of the storm and her eyes gazing on vacancy indicated that she was mentally contemplating the green summit of the pindus and the blue waters of the lake of yanina which like a magic mirror seemed to reflect the sombre picture which she sketched monte cristo looked at her with an indescribable expression of interest and pity go on my child said the count in the romaic language m hayde looked up abruptly as if the sonorous tones of monte cristos voice had awakened her from a dream and she resumed her narrative it was about four oclock in the afternoon and although the day was brilliant out-of-doors we were enveloped in the gloomy darkness of the cavern one single solitary light was burning there and it appeared like a star set in a heaven of blackness it was selims flaming lance my mother was a christian and she prayed selim repeated from time to time the sacred words god is great however my mother had still some hope as she was coming down she thought she recognized the french officer who had been sent to constantinople and in whom my father placed so much confidence for he knew that all the soldiers of the french emperor were naturally noble and generous she advanced some steps towards the staircase and listened they are approaching said she perhaps they bring us peace and liberty what do you fear vasiliki said selim in a voice at once so gentle and yet so proud if they do not bring us peace we will give them war if they do not bring life we will give them death and he renewed the flame of his lance with a gesture which made one think of dionysus of old crete but i being only a little child was terrified by this undaunted courage which appeared to me both ferocious and senseless and i recoiled with horror from the idea of the frightful death amidst fire and flames which probably awaited us my mother experienced the same sensations for i felt her tremble mamma mamma said i are we really to be killed and at the sound of my voice the slaves redoubled their cries and prayers and lamentations my child said vasiliki may god preserve you from ever wishing for that death which today you so much dread then whispering to selim she asked what were her masters orders if he send me his poniard it will signify that the emperors intentions are not favorable and i am to set fire to the powder if on the contrary he send me his ring it will be a sign that the emperor pardons him and i am to extinguish the match and leave the magazine untouched my friend said my mother when your masters orders arrive if it is the poniard which he sends instead of despatching us by that horrible death which we both so much dread you will mercifully kill us with this same poniard will you not yes vasiliki replied selim tranquilly suddenly we heard loud cries and listening discerned that they were cries of joy the name of the french officer who had been sent to constantinople resounded on all sides amongst our palikares it was evident that he brought the answer of the emperor and that it was favorable and do you not remember the frenchmans name said morcerf quite ready to aid the memory of the narrator monte cristo made a sign to him to be silent i do not recollect it said hayde the noise increased steps were heard approaching nearer and nearer they were descending the steps leading to the cavern selim made ready his lance soon a figure appeared in the gray twilight at the entrance of the cave formed by the reflection of the few rays of daylight which had found their way into this gloomy retreat who are you cried selim but whoever you may be i charge you not to advance another step long live the emperor said the figure he grants a full pardon to the vizier ali and not only gives him his life but restores to him his fortune and his possessions my mother uttered a cry of joy and clasped me to her bosom stop said selim seeing that she was about to go out you see i have not yet received the ring true said my mother and she fell on her knees at the same time holding me up towards heaven as if she desired while praying to god in my behalf to raise me actually to his presence and for the second time hayde stopped overcome by such violent emotion that the perspiration stood upon her pale brow and her stifled voice seemed hardly able to find utterance so parched and dry were her throat and lips m monte cristo poured a little iced water into a glass and presented it to her saying with a mildness in which was also a shade of command courage hayde dried her eyes and continued by this time our eyes habituated to the darkness
