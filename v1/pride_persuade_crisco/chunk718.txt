this land i have to weep over the grave of my father replied morrel in a broken voice well then go wait for me there and i will soon join you you leave me then yes i also have a pious visit to pay morrel allowed his hand to fall into that which the count extended to him then with an inexpressibly sorrowful inclination of the head he quitted the count and bent his steps to the east of the city monte cristo remained on the same spot until maximilian was out of sight he then walked slowly towards the alles de meilhan to seek out a small house with which our readers were made familiar at the beginning of this story it yet stood under the shade of the fine avenue of lime-trees which forms one of the most frequent walks of the idlers of marseilles covered by an immense vine which spreads its aged and blackened branches over the stone front burnt yellow by the ardent sun of the south two stone steps worn away by the friction of many feet led to the door which was made of three planks the door had never been painted or varnished so great cracks yawned in it during the dry season to close again when the rains came on the house with all its crumbling antiquity and apparent misery was yet cheerful and picturesque and was the same that old dants formerly inhabited the only difference being that the old man occupied merely the garret while the whole house was now placed at the command of mercds by the count the woman whom the count had seen leave the ship with so much regret entered this house she had scarcely closed the door after her when monte cristo appeared at the corner of a street so that he found and lost her again almost at the same instant the worn out steps were old acquaintances of his he knew better than anyone else how to open that weather-beaten door with the large headed nail which served to raise the latch within he entered without knocking or giving any other intimation of his presence as if he had been a friend or the master of the place at the end of a passage paved with bricks was a little garden bathed in sunshine and rich in warmth and light in this garden mercds had found at the place indicated by the count the sum of money which he through a sense of delicacy had described as having been placed there twenty-four years previously the trees of the garden were easily seen from the steps of the street-door monte cristo on stepping into the house heard a sigh that was almost a deep sob he looked in the direction whence it came and there under an arbor of virginia jessamine with its thick foliage and beautiful long purple flowers he saw mercds seated with her head bowed and weeping bitterly she had raised her veil and with her face hidden by her hands was giving free scope to the sighs and tears which had been so long restrained by the presence of her son monte cristo advanced a few steps which were heard on the gravel mercds raised her head and uttered a cry of terror on beholding a man before her m madame said the count it is no longer in my power to restore you to happiness but i offer you consolation will you deign to accept it as coming from a friend i am indeed most wretched replied mercds alone in the world i had but my son and he has left me he possesses a noble heart madame replied the count and he has acted rightly he feels that every man owes a tribute to his country some contribute their talents others their industry these devote their blood those their nightly labors to the same cause had he remained with you his life must have become a hateful burden nor would he have participated in your griefs he will increase in strength and honor by struggling with adversity which he will convert into prosperity leave him to build up the future for you and i venture to say you will confide it to safe hands oh replied the wretched woman mournfully shaking her head the prosperity of which you speak and which from the bottom of my heart i pray god in his mercy to grant him i can never enjoy the bitter cup of adversity has been drained by me to the very dregs and i feel that the grave is not far distant you have acted kindly count in bringing me back to the place where i have enjoyed so much bliss i ought to meet death on the same spot where happiness was once all my own alas said monte cristo your words sear and embitter my heart the more so as you have every reason to hate me i have been the cause of all your misfortunes but why do you pity instead of blaming me you render me still more unhappy hate you blame you you edmond hate reproach the man that has spared my sons life for was it not your fatal and sanguinary intention to destroy that son of whom m de morcerf was so proud oh look at me closely and discover
