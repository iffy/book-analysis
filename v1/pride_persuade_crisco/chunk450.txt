you by your title when i first addressed you he said but you are aware that we are living under a popular form of government and that i am myself a representative of the liberties of the people so much so replied monte cristo that while you call yourself baron you are not willing to call anybody else count upon my word monsieur said danglars with affected carelessness i attach no sort of value to such empty distinctions but the fact is i was made baron and also chevalier of the legion of honor in return for services rendered but but you have discarded your titles after the example set you by messrs de montmorency and lafayette that was a noble example to follow monsieur why replied danglars not entirely so with the servants you understand i see to your domestics you are my lord the journalists style you monsieur while your constituents call you citizen these are distinctions very suitable under a constitutional government i understand perfectly again danglars bit his lips he saw that he was no match for monte cristo in an argument of this sort and he therefore hastened to turn to subjects more congenial permit me to inform you count said he bowing that i have received a letter of advice from thomson french of rome i am glad to hear it baron for i must claim the privilege of addressing you after the manner of your servants i have acquired the bad habit of calling persons by their titles from living in a country where barons are still barons by right of birth but as regards the letter of advice i am charmed to find that it has reached you that will spare me the troublesome and disagreeable task of coming to you for money myself you have received a regular letter of advice yes said danglars but i confess i didnt quite comprehend its meaning indeed and for that reason i did myself the honor of calling upon you in order to beg for an explanation go on monsieur here i am ready to give you any explanation you desire why said danglars in the letter i believe i have it about me here he felt in his breast-pocket yes here it is well this letter gives the count of monte cristo unlimited credit on our house well baron what is there difficult to understand about that merely the term unlimited nothing else certainly is not that word known in france the people who wrote are anglo-germans you know oh as for the composition of the letter there is nothing to be said but as regards the competency of the document i certainly have doubts is it possible asked the count assuming all air and tone of the utmost simplicity and candor is it possible that thomson french are not looked upon as safe and solvent bankers pray tell me what you think baron for i feel uneasy i can assure you having some considerable property in their hands thomson french are perfectly solvent replied danglars with an almost mocking smile but the word unlimited in financial affairs is so extremely vague is in fact unlimited said monte cristo precisely what i was about to say cried danglars now what is vague is doubtful and it was a wise man who said when in doubt keep out meaning to say rejoined monte cristo that however thomson french may be inclined to commit acts of imprudence and folly the baron danglars is not disposed to follow their example not at all plainly enough messrs thomson french set no bounds to their engagements while those of m danglars have their limits he is a wise man according to his own showing monsieur replied the banker drawing himself up with a haughty air the extent of my resources has never yet been questioned it seems then reserved for me said monte cristo coldly to be the first to do so by what right sir by right of the objections you have raised and the explanations you have demanded which certainly must have some motive once more danglars bit his lips it was the second time he had been worsted and this time on his own ground his forced politeness sat awkwardly upon him and approached almost to impertinence monte cristo on the contrary preserved a graceful suavity of demeanor aided by a certain degree of simplicity he could assume at pleasure and thus possessed the advantage well sir resumed danglars after a brief silence i will endeavor to make myself understood by requesting you to inform me for what sum you propose to draw upon me why truly replied monte cristo determined not to lose an inch of the ground he had gained my reason for desiring an unlimited credit was precisely because i did not know how much money i might need the banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper hand so throwing himself back in his armchair he said with an arrogant and purse-proud air let me beg of you not to hesitate in naming your wishes you will then be convinced that the resources of the house of danglars however limited are still equal to meeting the largest demands and were you even to require a million i beg your pardon interposed monte cristo i said a million replied danglars
