that i should renew my promise of remaining tranquil noirtiers eye remained fixed and firm as if to imply that a promise did not suffice then it passed from his face to his hands shall i swear to you sir asked maximilian yes said the paralytic with the same solemnity morrel understood that the old man attached great importance to an oath he extended his hand i swear to you on my honor said he to await your decision respecting the course i am to pursue with m dpinay that is right said the old man now said morrel do you wish me to retire yes without seeing mademoiselle valentine yes morrel made a sign that he was ready to obey but said he first allow me to embrace you as your daughter did just now noirtiers expression could not be understood the young man pressed his lips on the same spot on the old mans forehead where valentines had been then he bowed a second time and retired he found outside the door the old servant to whom valentine had given directions morrel was conducted along a dark passage which led to a little door opening on the garden soon found the spot where he had entered with the assistance of the shrubs gained the top of the wall and by his ladder was in an instant in the clover-field where his cabriolet was still waiting for him he got in it and thoroughly wearied by so many emotions arrived about midnight in the rue meslay threw himself on his bed and slept soundly volume four m m m chapter the villefort family vault two days after a considerable crowd was assembled towards ten oclock in the morning around the door of m de villeforts house and a long file of mourning-coaches and private carriages extended along the faubourg saint-honor and the rue de la ppinire among them was one of a very singular form which appeared to have come from a distance it was a kind of covered wagon painted black and was one of the first to arrive inquiry was made and it was ascertained that by a strange coincidence this carriage contained the corpse of the marquis de saint-mran and that those who had come thinking to attend one funeral would follow two their number was great the marquis de saint-mran one of the most zealous and faithful dignitaries of louis xviii and king charles x had preserved a great number of friends and these added to the personages whom the usages of society gave villefort a claim on formed a considerable body due information was given to the authorities and permission obtained that the two funerals should take place at the same time a second hearse decked with the same funereal pomp was brought to m de villeforts door and the coffin removed into it from the post-wagon the two bodies were to be interred in the cemetery of pre-lachaise where m de villefort had long since had a tomb prepared for the reception of his family the remains of poor rene were already deposited there and now after ten years of separation her father and mother were to be reunited with her the parisians always curious always affected by funereal display looked on with religious silence while the splendid procession accompanied to their last abode two of the number of the old aristocracy the greatest protectors of commerce and sincere devotees to their principles in one of the mourning-coaches beauchamp debray and chteau-renaud were talking of the very sudden death of the marchioness i saw madame de saint-mran only last year at marseilles when i was coming back from algiers said chteau-renaud she looked like a woman destined to live to be a hundred years old from her apparent sound health and great activity of mind and body how old was she franz assured me replied albert that she was sixty-six years old but she has not died of old age but of grief it appears that since the death of the marquis which affected her very deeply she has not completely recovered her reason but of what disease then did she die asked debray it is said to have been a congestion of the brain or apoplexy which is the same thing is it not nearly it is difficult to believe that it was apoplexy said beauchamp madame de saint-mran whom i once saw was short of slender form and of a much more nervous than sanguine temperament grief could hardly produce apoplexy in such a constitution as that of madame de saint-mran at any rate said albert whatever disease or doctor may have killed her m de villefort or rather mademoiselle valentine or still rather our friend franz inherits a magnificent fortune amounting i believe to livres per annum and this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old jacobin noirtier that is a tenacious old grandfather said beauchamp tenacem propositi virum i think he must have made an agreement with death to outlive all his heirs and he appears likely to succeed he resembles the old conventionalist of who said to napoleon in you bend because your empire is a young stem weakened by rapid growth take the republic for a tutor let us return with renewed strength to the battle-field and i promise you soldiers
