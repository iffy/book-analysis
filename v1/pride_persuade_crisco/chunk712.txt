the corridors through force of habit he threw aside his magisterial robe not out of deference to etiquette but because it was an unbearable burden a veritable garb of nessus insatiate in torture having staggered as far as the rue dauphine he perceived his carriage awoke his sleeping coachman by opening the door himself threw himself on the cushions and pointed towards the faubourg saint-honor the carriage drove on all the weight of his fallen fortune seemed suddenly to crush him he could not foresee the consequences he could not contemplate the future with the indifference of the hardened criminal who merely faces a contingency already familiar god was still in his heart god he murmured not knowing what he said god god behind the event that had overwhelmed him he saw the hand of god the carriage rolled rapidly onward villefort while turning restlessly on the cushions felt something press against him he put out his hand to remove the object it was a fan which madame de villefort had left in the carriage this fan awakened a recollection which darted through his mind like lightning he thought of his wife m oh he exclaimed as though a red-hot iron were piercing his heart during the last hour his own crime had alone been presented to his mind now another object not less terrible suddenly presented itself his wife he had just acted the inexorable judge with her he had condemned her to death and she crushed by remorse struck with terror covered with the shame inspired by the eloquence of his irreproachable virtue she a poor weak woman without help or the power of defending herself against his absolute and supreme will she might at that very moment perhaps be preparing to die an hour had elapsed since her condemnation at that moment doubtless she was recalling all her crimes to her memory she was asking pardon for her sins perhaps she was even writing a letter imploring forgiveness from her virtuous husband a forgiveness she was purchasing with her death villefort again groaned with anguish and despair ah he exclaimed that woman became criminal only from associating with me i carried the infection of crime with me and she has caught it as she would the typhus fever the cholera the plague and yet i have punished her i have dared to tell her i have repent and die but no she must not die she shall live and with me we will flee from paris and go as far as the earth reaches i told her of the scaffold oh heavens i forgot that it awaits me also how could i pronounce that word yes we will fly i will confess all to her i will tell her daily that i also have committed a crime oh what an alliance the tiger and the serpent worthy wife of such as i am she must live that my infamy may diminish hers and villefort dashed open the window in front of the carriage faster faster he cried in a tone which electrified the coachman the horses impelled by fear flew towards the house yes yes repeated villefort as he approached his home yes that woman must live she must repent and educate my son the sole survivor with the exception of the indestructible old man of the wreck of my house she loves him it was for his sake she has committed these crimes we ought never to despair of softening the heart of a mother who loves her child she will repent and no one will know that she has been guilty the events which have taken place in my house though they now occupy the public mind will be forgotten in time or if indeed a few enemies should persist in remembering them why then i will add them to my list of crimes what will it signify if one two or three more are added my wife and child shall escape from this gulf carrying treasures with them she will live and may yet be happy since her child in whom all her love is centred will be with her i shall have performed a good action and my heart will be lighter and the procureur breathed more freely than he had done for some time m the carriage stopped at the door of the house villefort leaped out of the carriage and saw that his servants were surprised at his early return he could read no other expression on their features neither of them spoke to him they merely stood aside to let him pass by as usual nothing more as he passed by m noirtiers room he perceived two figures through the half-open door but he experienced no curiosity to know who was visiting his father anxiety carried him on further come he said as he ascended the stairs leading to his wifes room nothing is changed here he then closed the door of the landing no one must disturb us he said i must speak freely to her accuse myself and say he approached the door touched the crystal handle which yielded to his hand not locked he cried that is well and he entered the little room in which edward slept for though the child went to school during the day his mother could not allow him to be separated from her
