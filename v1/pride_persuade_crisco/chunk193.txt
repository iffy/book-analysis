for news from uppercross and lyme she wanted to hear much more than mary had communicated it was three weeks since she had heard at all she only knew that henrietta was at home again and that louisa though considered to be recovering fast was still in lyme and she was thinking of them all very intently one evening when a thicker letter than usual from mary was delivered to her and to quicken the pleasure and surprise with admiral and mrs croft's compliments the crofts must be in bath a circumstance to interest her they were people whom her heart turned to very naturally what is this cried sir walter the crofts have arrived in bath the crofts who rent kellynch what have they brought you a letter from uppercross cottage sir oh those letters are convenient passports they secure an introduction i should have visited admiral croft however at any rate i know what is due to my tenant anne could listen no longer she could not even have told how the poor admiral's complexion escaped her letter engrossed her it had been begun several days back february st my dear anne--i make no apology for my silence because i know how little people think of letters in such a place as bath you must be a great deal too happy to care for uppercross which as you well know affords little to write about we have had a very dull christmas mr and mrs musgrove have not had one dinner party all the holidays i do not reckon the hayters as anybody the holidays however are over at last i believe no children ever had such long ones i am sure i had not the house was cleared yesterday except of the little harvilles but you will be surprised to hear they have never gone home mrs harville must be an odd mother to part with them so long i do not understand it they are not at all nice children in my opinion but mrs musgrove seems to like them quite as well if not better than her grandchildren what dreadful weather we have had it may not be felt in bath with your nice pavements but in the country it is of some consequence i have not had a creature call on me since the second week in january except charles hayter who had been calling much oftener than was welcome between ourselves i think it a great pity henrietta did not remain at lyme as long as louisa it would have kept her a little out of his way the carriage is gone to-day to bring louisa and the harvilles to-morrow we are not asked to dine with them however till the day after mrs musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey which is not very likely considering the care that will be taken of her and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to-morrow i am glad you find mr elliot so agreeable and wish i could be acquainted with him too but i have my usual luck i am always out of the way when any thing desirable is going on always the last of my family to be noticed what an immense time mrs clay has been staying with elizabeth does she never mean to go away but perhaps if she were to leave the room vacant we might not be invited let me know what you think of this i do not expect my children to be asked you know i can leave them at the great house very well for a month or six weeks i have this moment heard that the crofts are going to bath almost immediately they think the admiral gouty charles heard it quite by chance they have not had the civility to give me any notice or of offering to take anything i do not think they improve at all as neighbours we see nothing of them and this is really an instance of gross inattention charles joins me in love and everything proper yours affectionately mary m i am sorry to say that i am very far from well and jemima has just told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore-throat very much about i dare say i shall catch it and my sore-throats you know are always worse than anybody's so ended the first part which had been afterwards put into an envelope containing nearly as much more i kept my letter open that i might send you word how louisa bore her journey and now i am extremely glad i did having a great deal to add in the first place i had a note from mrs croft yesterday offering to convey anything to you a very kind friendly note indeed addressed to me just as it ought i shall therefore be able to make my letter as long as i like the admiral does not seem very ill and i sincerely hope bath will do him all the good he wants i shall be truly glad to have them back again our neighbourhood cannot spare such a pleasant family but now for louisa i have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little she and the harvilles came on tuesday very safely and in the evening we went to
