lives in the family i believe what a very good-looking man yes and miss atkinson who dined with him once at the wallises says he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with she is pretty i think anne elliot very pretty when one comes to look at her it is not the fashion to say so but i confess i admire her more than her sister oh so do i and so do i no comparison but the men are all wild after miss elliot anne is too delicate for them anne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin if he would have walked by her side all the way to camden place without saying a word she had never found it so difficult to listen to him though nothing could exceed his solicitude and care and though his subjects were principally such as were wont to be always interesting praise warm just and discriminating of lady russell and insinuations highly rational against mrs clay but just now she could think only of captain wentworth she could not understand his present feelings whether he were really suffering much from disappointment or not and till that point were settled she could not be quite herself she hoped to be wise and reasonable in time but alas alas she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet another circumstance very essential for her to know was how long he meant to be in bath he had not mentioned it or she could not recollect it he might be only passing through but it was more probable that he should be come to stay in that case so liable as every body was to meet every body in bath lady russell would in all likelihood see him somewhere would she recollect him how would it all be she had already been obliged to tell lady russell that louisa musgrove was to marry captain benwick it had cost her something to encounter lady russell's surprise and now if she were by any chance to be thrown into company with captain wentworth her imperfect knowledge of the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him the following morning anne was out with her friend and for the first hour in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain but at last in returning down pulteney street she distinguished him on the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view the greater part of the street there were many other men about him many groups walking the same way but there was no mistaking him she looked instinctively at lady russell but not from any mad idea of her recognising him so soon as she did herself no it was not to be supposed that lady russell would perceive him till they were nearly opposite she looked at her however from time to time anxiously and when the moment approached which must point him out though not daring to look again for her own countenance she knew was unfit to be seen she was yet perfectly conscious of lady russell's eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him--of her being in short intently observing him she could thoroughly comprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over lady russell's mind the difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes the astonishment she must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him and in foreign climes and in active service too without robbing him of one personal grace at last lady russell drew back her head now how would she speak of him you will wonder said she what has been fixing my eye so long but i was looking after some window-curtains which lady alicia and mrs frankland were telling me of last night they described the drawing-room window-curtains of one of the houses on this side of the way and this part of the street as being the handsomest and best hung of any in bath but could not recollect the exact number and i have been trying to find out which it could be but i confess i can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description anne sighed and blushed and smiled in pity and disdain either at her friend or herself the part which provoked her most was that in all this waste of foresight and caution she should have lost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them a day or two passed without producing anything the theatre or the rooms where he was most likely to be were not fashionable enough for the elliots whose evening amusements were solely in the elegant stupidity of private parties in which they were getting more and more engaged and anne wearied of such a state of stagnation sick of knowing nothing and fancying herself stronger because her strength was not tried was quite impatient for the concert evening it was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by lady dalrymple of course they must attend it was really expected to be a good one and captain wentworth was very fond of music if she could only have a few minutes conversation with him again she fancied she should be satisfied and as to the power of addressing him she
