nearer to the former than to the latter a small roadside inn from the front of which hung creaking and flapping in the wind a sheet of tin covered with a grotesque representation of the pont du gard this modern place of entertainment stood on the left-hand side of the post road and backed upon the rhne it also boasted of what in languedoc is styled a garden consisting of a small plot of ground on the side opposite to the main entrance reserved for the reception of guests a few dingy olives and stunted fig-trees struggled hard for existence but their withered dusty foliage abundantly proved how unequal was the conflict between these sickly shrubs grew a scanty supply of garlic tomatoes and eschalots while lone and solitary like a forgotten sentinel a tall pine raised its melancholy head in one of the corners of this unattractive spot and displayed its flexible stem and fan-shaped summit dried and cracked by the fierce heat of the sub-tropical sun all these trees great or small were turned in the direction to which the mistral blows one of the three curses of provence the others being the durance and the parliament in the surrounding plain which more resembled a dusty lake than solid ground were scattered a few miserable stalks of wheat the effect no doubt of a curious desire on the part of the agriculturists of the country to see whether such a thing as the raising of grain in those parched regions was practicable each stalk served as a perch for a grasshopper which regaled the passers-by through this egyptian scene with its strident monotonous note for about seven or eight years the little tavern had been kept by a man and his wife with two servants a chambermaid named trinette and a hostler called pecaud this small staff was quite equal to all the requirements for a canal between beaucaire and aiguemortes had revolutionized transportation by substituting boats for the cart and the stagecoach and as though to add to the daily misery which this prosperous canal inflicted on the unfortunate innkeeper whose utter ruin it was fast accomplishing it was situated between the rhne from which it had its source and the post-road it had depleted not a hundred steps from the inn of which we have given a brief but faithful description the innkeeper himself was a man of from forty to fifty-five years of age tall strong and bony a perfect specimen of the natives of those southern latitudes he had dark sparkling and deep-set eyes hooked nose and teeth white as those of a carnivorous animal his hair like his beard which he wore under his chin was thick and curly and in spite of his age but slightly interspersed with a few silvery threads his naturally dark complexion had assumed a still further shade of brown from the habit the unfortunate man had acquired of stationing himself from morning till eve at the threshold of his door on the lookout for guests who seldom came yet there he stood day after day exposed to the meridional rays of a burning sun with no other protection for his head than a red handkerchief twisted around it after the manner of the spanish muleteers this man was our old acquaintance gaspard caderousse his wife on the contrary whose maiden name had been madeleine radelle was pale meagre and sickly-looking born in the neighborhood of arles she had shared in the beauty for which its women are proverbial but that beauty had gradually withered beneath the devastating influence of the slow fever so prevalent among dwellers by the ponds of aiguemortes and the marshes of camargue she remained nearly always in her second-floor chamber shivering in her chair or stretched languid and feeble on her bed while her husband kept his daily watch at the door a duty he performed with so much the greater willingness as it saved him the necessity of listening to the endless plaints and murmurs of his helpmate who never saw him without breaking out into bitter invectives against fate to all of which her husband would calmly return an unvarying reply in these philosophic words hush la carconte it is gods pleasure that things should be so the sobriquet of la carconte had been bestowed on madeleine radelle from the fact that she had been born in a village so called situated between salon and lambesc and as a custom existed among the inhabitants of that part of france where caderousse lived of styling every person by some particular and distinctive appellation her husband had bestowed on her the name of la carconte in place of her sweet and euphonious name of madeleine which in all probability his rude gutteral language would not have enabled him to pronounce still let it not be supposed that amid this affected resignation to the will of providence the unfortunate innkeeper did not writhe under the double misery of seeing the hateful canal carry off his customers and his profits and the daily infliction of his peevish partners murmurs and lamentations m like other dwellers in the south he was a man of sober habits and moderate desires but fond of external show vain and addicted to display during the days of his prosperity not a festivity took place without himself and wife being among the spectators
