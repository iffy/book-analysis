you my heart beats fast the blood burns in my veins and i can hardly breathe but i solemnly promise you to restrain all this ardor this fervor and intensity of feeling until you yourself shall require me to render them available in serving or assisting you m franz is not expected to return home for a year to come i am told in that time many favorable and unforeseen chances may befriend us let us then hope for the best hope is so sweet a comforter meanwhile valentine while reproaching me with selfishness think a little what you have been to me the beautiful but cold resemblance of a marble venus what promise of future reward have you made me for all the submission and obedience i have evinced none whatever what granted me scarcely more you tell me of m franz dpinay your betrothed lover and you shrink from the idea of being his wife but tell me valentine is there no other sorrow in your heart you see me devoted to you body and soul my life and each warm drop that circles round my heart are consecrated to your service you know full well that my existence is bound up in yours that were i to lose you i would not outlive the hour of such crushing misery yet you speak with calmness of the prospect of your being the wife of another oh valentine were i in your place and did i feel conscious as you do of being worshipped adored with such a love as mine a hundred times at least should i have passed my hand between these iron bars and said take this hand dearest maximilian and believe that living or dead i am yours yours only and forever the poor girl made no reply but her lover could plainly hear her sobs and tears a rapid change took place in the young mans feelings dearest dearest valentine exclaimed he forgive me if i have offended you and forget the words i spoke if they have unwittingly caused you pain no maximilian i am not offended answered she but do you not see what a poor helpless being i am almost a stranger and an outcast in my fathers house where even he is seldom seen whose will has been thwarted and spirits broken from the age of ten years beneath the iron rod so sternly held over me oppressed mortified and persecuted day by day hour by hour minute by minute no person has cared for even observed my sufferings nor have i ever breathed one word on the subject save to yourself outwardly and in the eyes of the world i am surrounded by kindness and affection but the reverse is the case the general remark is oh it cannot be expected that one of so stern a character as m villefort could lavish the tenderness some fathers do on their daughters what though she has lost her own mother at a tender age she has had the happiness to find a second mother in madame de villefort the world however is mistaken my father abandons me from utter indifference while my stepmother detests me with a hatred so much the more terrible because it is veiled beneath a continual smile hate you sweet valentine exclaimed the young man how is it possible for anyone to do that alas replied the weeping girl i am obliged to own that my stepmothers aversion to me arises from a very natural source her overweening love for her own child my brother edward but why should it i do not know but though unwilling to introduce money matters into our present conversation i will just say this much that her extreme dislike to me has its origin there and i much fear she envies me the fortune i enjoy in right of my mother and which will be more than doubled at the death of m and mme de saint-mran whose sole heiress i am madame de villefort has nothing of her own and hates me for being so richly endowed alas how gladly would i exchange the half of this wealth for the happiness of at least sharing my fathers love god knows i would prefer sacrificing the whole so that it would obtain me a happy and affectionate home poor valentine i seem to myself as though living a life of bondage yet at the same time am so conscious of my own weakness that i fear to break the restraint in which i am held lest i fall utterly helpless then too my father is not a person whose orders may be infringed with impunity protected as he is by his high position and firmly established reputation for talent and unswerving integrity no one could oppose him he is all-powerful even with the king he would crush you at a word dear maximilian believe me when i assure you that if i do not attempt to resist my fathers commands it is more on your account than my own but why valentine do you persist in anticipating the worst why picture so gloomy a future because i judge it from the past still consider that although i may not be strictly speaking what is termed an illustrious match for you i am for many reasons not altogether so much beneath your alliance
