to borrow money what then have i to fear from him you are right said the countess and my fears are weakness especially when directed against a man who has saved your life how did your father receive him albert it is necessary that we should be more than complaisant to the count m de morcerf is sometimes occupied his business makes him reflective and he might without intending it nothing could be in better taste than my fathers demeanor madame said albert nay more he seemed greatly flattered at two or three compliments which the count very skilfully and agreeably paid him with as much ease as if he had known him these thirty years each of these little tickling arrows must have pleased my father added albert with a laugh and thus they parted the best possible friends and m de morcerf even wished to take him to the chamber to hear the speakers the countess made no reply she fell into so deep a reverie that her eyes gradually closed the young man standing up before her gazed upon her with that filial affection which is so tender and endearing with children whose mothers are still young and handsome then after seeing her eyes closed and hearing her breathe gently he believed she had dropped asleep and left the apartment on tiptoe closing the door after him with the utmost precaution this devil of a fellow he muttered shaking his head i said at the time he would create a sensation here and i measure his effect by an infallible thermometer my mother has noticed him and he must therefore perforce be remarkable he went down to the stables not without some slight annoyance when he remembered that the count of monte cristo had laid his hands on a turnout which sent his bays down to second place in the opinion of connoisseurs most decidedly said he men are not equal and i must beg my father to develop this theorem in the chamber of peers chapter monsieur bertuccio meanwhile the count had arrived at his house it had taken him six minutes to perform the distance but these six minutes were sufficient to induce twenty young men who knew the price of the equipage they had been unable to purchase themselves to put their horses in a gallop in order to see the rich foreigner who could afford to give francs apiece for his horses the house ali had chosen and which was to serve as a town residence to monte cristo was situated on the right hand as you ascend the champs-lyses a thick clump of trees and shrubs rose in the centre and masked a portion of the front around this shrubbery two alleys like two arms extended right and left and formed a carriage-drive from the iron gates to a double portico on every step of which stood a porcelain vase filled with flowers this house isolated from the rest had besides the main entrance another in the rue de ponthieu even before the coachman had hailed the concierge the massy gates rolled on their hinges they had seen the count coming and at paris as everywhere else he was served with the rapidity of lightning the coachman entered and traversed the half-circle without slackening his speed and the gates were closed ere the wheels had ceased to sound on the gravel the carriage stopped at the left side of the portico two men presented themselves at the carriage-window the one was ali who smiling with an expression of the most sincere joy seemed amply repaid by a mere look from monte cristo the other bowed respectfully and offered his arm to assist the count in descending thanks m bertuccio said the count springing lightly up the three steps of the portico and the notary he is in the small salon excellency returned bertuccio and the cards i ordered to be engraved as soon as you knew the number of the house your excellency it is done already i have been myself to the best engraver of the palais royal who did the plate in my presence the first card struck off was taken according to your orders to the baron danglars rue de la chausse dantin no the others are on the mantle-piece of your excellencys bedroom good what oclock is it four oclock monte cristo gave his hat cane and gloves to the same french footman who had called his carriage at the count of morcerfs and then he passed into the small salon preceded by bertuccio who showed him the way these are but indifferent marbles in this antechamber said monte cristo i trust all this will soon be taken away bertuccio bowed as the steward had said the notary awaited him in the small salon he was a simple-looking lawyers clerk elevated to the extraordinary dignity of a provincial scrivener you are the notary empowered to sell the country house that i wish to purchase monsieur asked monte cristo yes count returned the notary is the deed of sale ready yes count have you brought it here it is very well and where is this house that i purchase asked the count carelessly addressing himself half to bertuccio half to the notary the steward made a gesture that signified i do not know the notary looked at the count with astonishment
