easy on that point answered villefort with one of his sweetest smiles you and i will always consult upon our verdicts my love said the marquise attend to your doves your lap-dogs and embroidery but do not meddle with what you do not understand nowadays the military profession is in abeyance and the magisterial robe is the badge of honor there is a wise latin proverb that is very much in point cedant arma tog said villefort with a bow i cannot speak latin responded the marquise well said rene i cannot help regretting you had not chosen some other profession than your own a physician for instance do you know i always felt a shudder at the idea of even a destroying angel dear good rene whispered villefort as he gazed with unutterable tenderness on the lovely speaker let us hope my child cried the marquis that m de villefort may prove the moral and political physician of this province if so he will have achieved a noble work and one which will go far to efface the recollection of his fathers conduct added the incorrigible marquise madame replied villefort with a mournful smile i have already had the honor to observe that my father has at least i hope so abjured his past errors and that he is at the present moment a firm and zealous friend to religion and order a better royalist possibly than his son for he has to atone for past dereliction while i have no other impulse than warm decided preference and conviction having made this well-turned speech villefort looked carefully around to mark the effect of his oratory much as he would have done had he been addressing the bench in open court do you know my dear villefort cried the comte de salvieux that is exactly what i myself said the other day at the tuileries when questioned by his majestys principal chamberlain touching the singularity of an alliance between the son of a girondin and the daughter of an officer of the duc de cond and i assure you he seemed fully to comprehend that this mode of reconciling political differences was based upon sound and excellent principles then the king who without our suspecting it had overheard our conversation interrupted us by saying villefort observe that the king did not pronounce the word noirtier but on the contrary placed considerable emphasis on that of villefort villefort said his majesty is a young man of great judgment and discretion who will be sure to make a figure in his profession i like him much and it gave me great pleasure to hear that he was about to become the son-in-law of the marquis and marquise de saint-mran i should myself have recommended the match had not the noble marquis anticipated my wishes by requesting my consent to it is it possible the king could have condescended so far as to express himself so favorably of me asked the enraptured villefort i give you his very words and if the marquis chooses to be candid he will confess that they perfectly agree with what his majesty said to him when he went six months ago to consult him upon the subject of your espousing his daughter m that is true answered the marquis how much do i owe this gracious prince what is there i would not do to evince my earnest gratitude that is right cried the marquise i love to see you thus now then were a conspirator to fall into your hands he would be most welcome for my part dear mother interposed rene i trust your wishes will not prosper and that providence will only permit petty offenders poor debtors and miserable cheats to fall into m de villeforts hands then i shall be contented just the same as though you prayed that a physician might only be called upon to prescribe for headaches measles and the stings of wasps or any other slight affection of the epidermis if you wish to see me the kings attorney you must desire for me some of those violent and dangerous diseases from the cure of which so much honor redounds to the physician at this moment and as though the utterance of villeforts wish had sufficed to effect its accomplishment a servant entered the room and whispered a few words in his ear villefort immediately rose from table and quitted the room upon the plea of urgent business he soon however returned his whole face beaming with delight rene regarded him with fond affection and certainly his handsome features lit up as they then were with more than usual fire and animation seemed formed to excite the innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful and intelligent lover you were wishing just now said villefort addressing her that i were a doctor instead of a lawyer well i at least resemble the disciples of esculapius in one thing people spoke in this style in that of not being able to call a day my own not even that of my betrothal and wherefore were you called away just now asked mademoiselle de saint-mran with an air of deep interest for a very serious matter which bids fair to make work for the executioner how dreadful exclaimed rene turning pale is it possible burst simultaneously from all who were near enough
