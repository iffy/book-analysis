the previous night struck half past five without this danglars would have been quite ignorant of the time for daylight did not reach his cell should he demand an explanation from the bandits or should he wait patiently for them to propose it the last alternative seemed the most prudent so he waited until twelve oclock during all this time a sentinel who had been relieved at eight oclock had been watching his door m danglars suddenly felt a strong inclination to see the person who kept watch over him he had noticed that a few rays not of daylight but from a lamp penetrated through the ill-joined planks of the door he approached just as the brigand was refreshing himself with a mouthful of brandy which owing to the leathern bottle containing it sent forth an odor which was extremely unpleasant to danglars faugh he exclaimed retreating to the farther corner of his cell at twelve this man was replaced by another functionary and danglars wishing to catch sight of his new guardian approached the door again he was an athletic gigantic bandit with large eyes thick lips and a flat nose his red hair fell in dishevelled masses like snakes around his shoulders ah ha cried danglars this fellow is more like an ogre than anything else however i am rather too old and tough to be very good eating we see that danglars was collected enough to jest at the same time as though to disprove the ogreish propensities the man took some black bread cheese and onions from his wallet which he began devouring voraciously may i be hanged said danglars glancing at the bandits dinner through the crevices of the door may i be hanged if i can understand how people can eat such filth and he withdrew to seat himself upon his goat-skin which reminded him of the smell of the brandy but the mysteries of nature are incomprehensible and there are certain invitations contained in even the coarsest food which appeal very irresistibly to a fasting stomach danglars felt his own not to be very well supplied just then and gradually the man appeared less ugly the bread less black and the cheese more fresh while those dreadful vulgar onions recalled to his mind certain sauces and side-dishes which his cook prepared in a very superior manner whenever he said monsieur deniseau let me have a nice little fricassee today he got up and knocked on the door the bandit raised his head danglars knew that he was heard so he redoubled his blows che cosa asked the bandit come come said danglars tapping his fingers against the door i think it is quite time to think of giving me something to eat but whether he did not understand him or whether he had received no orders respecting the nourishment of danglars the giant without answering went on with his dinner danglars feelings were hurt and not wishing to put himself under obligations to the brute the banker threw himself down again on his goat-skin and did not breathe another word four hours passed by and the giant was replaced by another bandit danglars who really began to experience sundry gnawings at the stomach arose softly again applied his eye to the crack of the door and recognized the intelligent countenance of his guide it was indeed peppino who was preparing to mount guard as comfortably as possible by seating himself opposite to the door and placing between his legs an earthen pan containing chick-peas stewed with bacon near the pan he also placed a pretty little basket of villetri grapes and a flask of orvieto peppino was decidedly an epicure danglars watched these preparations and his mouth watered come he said to himself let me try if he will be more tractable than the other and he tapped gently at the door on y va coming exclaimed peppino who from frequenting the house of signor pastrini understood french perfectly in all its idioms danglars immediately recognized him as the man who had called out in such a furious manner put in your head but this was not the time for recrimination so he assumed his most agreeable manner and said with a gracious smile excuse me sir but are they not going to give me any dinner does your excellency happen to be hungry happen to be hungry thats pretty good when i havent eaten for twenty-four hours muttered danglars then he added aloud yes sir i am hungry very hungry and your excellency wants something to eat at once if possible nothing easier said peppino here you can get anything you want by paying for it of course as among honest folk of course cried danglars although in justice the people who arrest and imprison you ought at least to feed you that is not the custom excellency said peppino a bad reason replied danglars who reckoned on conciliating his keeper but i am content let me have some dinner at once what would your excellency like and peppino placed his pan on the ground so that the steam rose directly under the nostrils of danglars give your orders have you kitchens here kitchens of course complete ones and cooks excellent well a fowl fish game it signifies little so that i eat as your excellency pleases you mentioned a fowl i think
