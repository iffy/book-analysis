introduced and everybody was to be introduced mr elliot came back accordingly and on application was forgiven as you know and re-admitted into the family and there it was his constant object and his only object till your arrival added another motive to watch sir walter and mrs clay he omitted no opportunity of being with them threw himself in their way called at all hours but i need not be particular on this subject you can imagine what an artful man would do and with this guide perhaps may recollect what you have seen him do yes said anne you tell me nothing which does not accord with what i have known or could imagine there is always something offensive in the details of cunning the manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity must ever be revolting but i have heard nothing which really surprises me i know those who would be shocked by such a representation of mr elliot who would have difficulty in believing it but i have never been satisfied i have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared i should like to know his present opinion as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not lessening i understand replied mrs smith he thinks mrs clay afraid of him aware that he sees through her and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence but since he must be absent some time or other i do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence mrs wallis has an amusing idea as nurse tells me that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and mr elliot marry that your father is not to marry mrs clay a scheme worthy of mrs wallis's understanding by all accounts but my sensible nurse rooke sees the absurdity of it why to be sure ma'am said she it would not prevent his marrying anybody else and indeed to own the truth i do not think nurse in her heart is a very strenuous opposer of sir walter's making a second match she must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony you know and since self will intrude who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next lady elliot through mrs wallis's recommendation i am very glad to know all this said anne after a little thoughtfulness it will be more painful to me in some respects to be in company with him but i shall know better what to do my line of conduct will be more direct mr elliot is evidently a disingenuous artificial worldly man who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness but mr elliot was not done with mrs smith had been carried away from her first direction and anne had forgotten in the interest of her own family concerns how much had been originally implied against him but her attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints and she listened to a recital which if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of mrs smith proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her very deficient both in justice and compassion she learned that the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by mr elliot's marriage they had been as before always together and mr elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune mrs smith did not want to take blame to herself and was most tender of throwing any on her husband but anne could collect that their income had never been equal to their style of living and that from the first there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance from his wife's account of him she could discern mr smith to have been a man of warm feelings easy temper careless habits and not strong understanding much more amiable than his friend and very unlike him led by him and probably despised by him mr elliot raised by his marriage to great affluence and disposed to every gratification of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself for with all his self-indulgence he had become a prudent man and beginning to be rich just as his friend ought to have found himself to be poor seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend's probable finances but on the contrary had been prompting and encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin and the smiths accordingly had been ruined the husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it they had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship of their friends and to prove that mr elliot's had better not be tried but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs was fully known with a confidence in mr elliot's regard more creditable to his feelings than his judgement mr smith had appointed him the executor of his will but mr elliot would not act and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation had been such as could not be related without anguish of spirit or listened
