with themselves in the profits which amounted to no less a sum than fifty piastres each m edmond preserved the most admirable self-command not suffering the faintest indication of a smile to escape him at the enumeration of all the benefits he would have reaped had he been able to quit the island but as la jeune amlie had merely come to monte cristo to fetch him away he embarked that same evening and proceeded with the captain to leghorn arrived at leghorn he repaired to the house of a jew a dealer in precious stones to whom he disposed of four of his smallest diamonds for five thousand francs each dants half feared that such valuable jewels in the hands of a poor sailor like himself might excite suspicion but the cunning purchaser asked no troublesome questions concerning a bargain by which he gained a round profit of at least eighty per cent the following day dants presented jacopo with an entirely new vessel accompanying the gift by a donation of one hundred piastres that he might provide himself with a suitable crew and other requisites for his outfit upon condition that he would go at once to marseilles for the purpose of inquiring after an old man named louis dants residing in the alles de meilhan and also a young woman called mercds an inhabitant of the catalan village jacopo could scarcely believe his senses at receiving this magnificent present which dants hastened to account for by saying that he had merely been a sailor from whim and a desire to spite his family who did not allow him as much money as he liked to spend but that on his arrival at leghorn he had come into possession of a large fortune left him by an uncle whose sole heir he was the superior education of dants gave an air of such extreme probability to this statement that it never once occurred to jacopo to doubt its accuracy the term for which edmond had engaged to serve on board la jeune amlie having expired dants took leave of the captain who at first tried all his powers of persuasion to induce him to remain as one of the crew but having been told the history of the legacy he ceased to importune him further the following morning jacopo set sail for marseilles with directions from dants to join him at the island of monte cristo having seen jacopo fairly out of the harbor dants proceeded to make his final adieus on board la jeune amlie distributing so liberal a gratuity among her crew as to secure for him the good wishes of all and expressions of cordial interest in all that concerned him to the captain he promised to write when he had made up his mind as to his future plans then dants departed for genoa at the moment of his arrival a small yacht was under trial in the bay this yacht had been built by order of an englishman who having heard that the genoese excelled all other builders along the shores of the mediterranean in the construction of fast-sailing vessels was desirous of possessing a specimen of their skill the price agreed upon between the englishman and the genoese builder was forty thousand francs dants struck with the beauty and capability of the little vessel applied to its owner to transfer it to him offering sixty thousand francs upon condition that he should be allowed to take immediate possession the proposal was too advantageous to be refused the more so as the person for whom the yacht was intended had gone upon a tour through switzerland and was not expected back in less than three weeks or a month by which time the builder reckoned upon being able to complete another a bargain was therefore struck dants led the owner of the yacht to the dwelling of a jew retired with the latter for a few minutes to a small back parlor and upon their return the jew counted out to the shipbuilder the sum of sixty thousand francs in bright gold pieces the delighted builder then offered his services in providing a suitable crew for the little vessel but this dants declined with many thanks saying he was accustomed to cruise about quite alone and his principal pleasure consisted in managing his yacht himself the only thing the builder could oblige him in would be to contrive a sort of secret closet in the cabin at his beds head the closet to contain three divisions so constructed as to be concealed from all but himself the builder cheerfully undertook the commission and promised to have these secret places completed by the next day dants furnishing the dimensions and plan in accordance with which they were to be constructed m two hours afterward dants sailed from the port of genoa under the inspection of an immense crowd drawn together by curiosity to see the rich spanish nobleman who preferred managing his own yacht but their wonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with which dants handled the helm the boat indeed seemed to be animated with almost human intelligence so promptly did it obey the slightest touch and dants required but a short trial of his beautiful craft to acknowledge that the genoese had not without reason attained their high reputation
