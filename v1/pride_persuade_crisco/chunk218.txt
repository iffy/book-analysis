or discretion as inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings she only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation to let mrs clay know that she had been seen with mr elliot three hours after his being supposed to be out of bath for having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview from the lady herself she determined to mention it and it seemed to her there was guilt in mrs clay's face as she listened it was transient cleared away in an instant but anne could imagine she read there the consciousness of having by some complication of mutual trick or some overbearing authority of his been obliged to attend perhaps for half an hour to his lectures and restrictions on her designs on sir walter she exclaimed however with a very tolerable imitation of nature oh dear very true only think miss elliot to my great surprise i met with mr elliot in bath street i was never more astonished he turned back and walked with me to the pump yard he had been prevented setting off for thornberry but i really forget by what for i was in a hurry and could not much attend and i can only answer for his being determined not to be delayed in his return he wanted to know how early he might be admitted to-morrow he was full of to-morrow and it is very evident that i have been full of it too ever since i entered the house and learnt the extension of your plan and all that had happened or my seeing him could never have gone so entirely out of my head chapter one day only had passed since anne's conversation with mrs smith but a keener interest had succeeded and she was now so little touched by mr elliot's conduct except by its effects in one quarter that it became a matter of course the next morning still to defer her explanatory visit in rivers street she had promised to be with the musgroves from breakfast to dinner her faith was plighted and mr elliot's character like the sultaness scheherazade's head must live another day she could not keep her appointment punctually however the weather was unfavourable and she had grieved over the rain on her friends account and felt it very much on her own before she was able to attempt the walk when she reached the white hart and made her way to the proper apartment she found herself neither arriving quite in time nor the first to arrive the party before her were mrs musgrove talking to mrs croft and captain harville to captain wentworth and she immediately heard that mary and henrietta too impatient to wait had gone out the moment it had cleared but would be back again soon and that the strictest injunctions had been left with mrs musgrove to keep her there till they returned she had only to submit sit down be outwardly composed and feel herself plunged at once in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of tasting a little before the morning closed there was no delay no waste of time she was deep in the happiness of such misery or the misery of such happiness instantly two minutes after her entering the room captain wentworth said we will write the letter we were talking of harville now if you will give me materials materials were at hand on a separate table he went to it and nearly turning his back to them all was engrossed by writing mrs musgrove was giving mrs croft the history of her eldest daughter's engagement and just in that inconvenient tone of voice which was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper anne felt that she did not belong to the conversation and yet as captain harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars such as how mr musgrove and my brother hayter had met again and again to talk it over what my brother hayter had said one day and what mr musgrove had proposed the next and what had occurred to my sister hayter and what the young people had wished and what i said at first i never could consent to but was afterwards persuaded to think might do very well and a great deal in the same style of open-hearted communication minutiae which even with every advantage of taste and delicacy which good mrs musgrove could not give could be properly interesting only to the principals mrs croft was attending with great good-humour and whenever she spoke at all it was very sensibly anne hoped the gentlemen might each be too much self-occupied to hear and so ma'am all these thing considered said mrs musgrove in her powerful whisper though we could have wished it different yet altogether we did not think it fair to stand out any longer for charles hayter was quite wild about it and henrietta was pretty near as bad and so we thought they had better marry at once and make the best of it as many others have done before them at any rate said i it will be better than a long engagement that is precisely what i was going to observe cried mrs croft i would rather have young people
