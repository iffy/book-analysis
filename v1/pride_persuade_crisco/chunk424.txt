seat morcerf offered him placed himself in such a manner as to remain concealed in the shadow of the large velvet curtains and read on the careworn and livid features of the count a whole history of secret griefs written in each wrinkle time had planted there the countess said morcerf was at her toilet when she was informed of the visit she was about to receive she will however be in the salon in ten minutes it is a great honor to me returned monte cristo to be thus on the first day of my arrival in paris brought in contact with a man whose merit equals his reputation and to whom fortune has for once been equitable but has she not still on the plains of mitidja or in the mountains of atlas a marshals staff to offer you oh replied morcerf reddening slightly i have left the service monsieur made a peer at the restoration i served through the first campaign under the orders of marshal bourmont i could therefore expect a higher rank and who knows what might have happened had the elder branch remained on the throne but the revolution of july was it seems sufficiently glorious to allow itself to be ungrateful and it was so for all services that did not date from the imperial period i tendered my resignation for when you have gained your epaulets on the battle-field you do not know how to manuvre on the slippery grounds of the salons i have hung up my sword and cast myself into politics i have devoted myself to industry i study the useful arts during the twenty years i served i often wished to do so but i had not the time these are the ideas that render your nation superior to any other returned monte cristo a gentleman of high birth possessor of an ample fortune you have consented to gain your promotion as an obscure soldier step by step this is uncommon then become general peer of france commander of the legion of honor you consent to again commence a second apprenticeship without any other hope or any other desire than that of one day becoming useful to your fellow-creatures this indeed is praiseworthy nay more it is sublime m albert looked on and listened with astonishment he was not used to see monte cristo give vent to such bursts of enthusiasm alas continued the stranger doubtless to dispel the slight cloud that covered morcerfs brow we do not act thus in italy we grow according to our race and our species and we pursue the same lines and often the same uselessness all our lives but monsieur said the count of morcerf for a man of your merit italy is not a country and france opens her arms to receive you respond to her call france will not perhaps be always ungrateful she treats her children ill but she always welcomes strangers ah father said albert with a smile it is evident you do not know the count of monte cristo he despises all honors and contents himself with those written on his passport that is the most just remark replied the stranger i ever heard made concerning myself you have been free to choose your career observed the count of morcerf with a sigh and you have chosen the path strewed with flowers precisely monsieur replied monte cristo with one of those smiles that a painter could never represent or a physiologist analyze if i did not fear to fatigue you said the general evidently charmed with the counts manners i would have taken you to the chamber there is a debate very curious to those who are strangers to our modern senators i shall be most grateful monsieur if you will at some future time renew your offer but i have been flattered with the hope of being introduced to the countess and i will therefore wait ah here is my mother cried the viscount monte cristo turned round hastily and saw madame de morcerf at the entrance of the salon at the door opposite to that by which her husband had entered pale and motionless when monte cristo turned round she let fall her arm which for some unknown reason had been resting on the gilded door-post she had been there some moments and had heard the last words of the visitor the latter rose and bowed to the countess who inclined herself without speaking ah good heavens madame said the count are you ill or is it the heat of the room that affects you are you ill mother cried the viscount springing towards her she thanked them both with a smile no returned she but i feel some emotion on seeing for the first time the man without whose intervention we should have been in tears and desolation monsieur continued the countess advancing with the majesty of a queen i owe to you the life of my son and for this i bless you now i thank you for the pleasure you give me in thus affording me the opportunity of thanking you as i have blessed you from the bottom of my heart the count bowed again but lower than before he was even paler than mercds madame said he the count and yourself recompense too generously a simple action to save a man
