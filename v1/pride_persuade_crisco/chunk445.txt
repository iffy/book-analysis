was secreted in the struggle her clothes caught fire and they were obliged to let go their hold in order to preserve themselves from sharing the same fate covered with flames assunta rushed wildly to the door but it was fastened she flew to the windows but they were also secured then the neighbors heard frightful shrieks it was assunta calling for help the cries died away in groans and next morning as soon as wasilios wife could muster up courage to venture abroad she caused the door of our dwelling to be opened by the public authorities when assunta although dreadfully burnt was found still breathing every drawer and closet in the house had been forced open and the money stolen benedetto never again appeared at rogliano neither have i since that day either seen or heard anything concerning him it was subsequently to these dreadful events that i waited on your excellency to whom it would have been folly to have mentioned benedetto since all trace of him seemed entirely lost or of my sister since she was dead and in what light did you view the occurrence inquired monte cristo as a punishment for the crime i had committed answered bertuccio oh those villeforts are an accursed race truly they are murmured the count in a lugubrious tone and now resumed bertuccio your excellency may perhaps be able to comprehend that this place which i revisit for the first time this garden the actual scene of my crime must have given rise to reflections of no very agreeable nature and produced that gloom and depression of spirits which excited the notice of your excellency who was pleased to express a desire to know the cause at this instant a shudder passes over me as i reflect that possibly i am now standing on the very grave in which lies m de villefort by whose hand the ground was dug to receive the corpse of his child everything is possible said monte cristo rising from the bench on which he had been sitting even he added in an inaudible voice even that the procureur be not dead the abb busoni did right to send you to me he went on in his ordinary tone and you have done well in relating to me the whole of your history as it will prevent my forming any erroneous opinions concerning you in future as for that benedetto who so grossly belied his name have you never made any effort to trace out whither he has gone or what has become of him no far from wishing to learn whither he has betaken himself i should shun the possibility of meeting him as i would a wild beast thank god i have never heard his name mentioned by any person and i hope and believe he is dead do not think so bertuccio replied the count for the wicked are not so easily disposed of for god seems to have them under his special watch-care to make of them instruments of his vengeance so be it responded bertuccio all i ask of heaven is that i may never see him again and now your excellency he added bowing his head you know everything you are my judge on earth as the almighty is in heaven have you for me no words of consolation my good friend i can only repeat the words addressed to you by the abb busoni villefort merited punishment for what he had done to you and perhaps to others benedetto if still living will become the instrument of divine retribution in some way or other and then be duly punished in his turn as far as you yourself are concerned i see but one point in which you are really guilty ask yourself wherefore after rescuing the infant from its living grave you did not restore it to its mother there was the crime bertuccio that was where you became really culpable true excellency that was the crime the real crime for in that i acted like a coward my first duty directly i had succeeded in recalling the babe to life was to restore it to its mother but in order to do so i must have made close and careful inquiry which would in all probability have led to my own apprehension and i clung to life partly on my sisters account and partly from that feeling of pride inborn in our hearts of desiring to come off untouched and victorious in the execution of our vengeance perhaps too the natural and instinctive love of life made me wish to avoid endangering my own and then again i am not as brave and courageous as was my poor brother bertuccio hid his face in his hands as he uttered these words while monte cristo fixed on him a look of inscrutable meaning after a brief silence rendered still more solemn by the time and place the count said in a tone of melancholy wholly unlike his usual manner in order to bring this conversation to a fitting termination the last we shall ever hold upon this subject i will repeat to you some words i have heard from the lips of the abb busoni for all evils there are two remedies time and silence and now leave me monsieur bertuccio to walk alone here in the garden
