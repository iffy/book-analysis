i think i have the honor of addressing count andrea cavalcanti count andrea cavalcanti repeated the young man accompanying his words with a bow you are charged with a letter of introduction addressed to me are you not said the count i did not mention that because the signature seemed to me so strange the letter signed sinbad the sailor is it not exactly so now as i have never known any sinbad with the exception of the one celebrated in the thousand and one nights well it is one of his descendants and a great friend of mine he is a very rich englishman eccentric almost to insanity and his real name is lord wilmore ah indeed then that explains everything that is extraordinary said andrea he is then the same englishman whom i met at ah yes indeed well monsieur i am at your service if what you say be true replied the count smiling perhaps you will be kind enough to give me some account of yourself and your family certainly i will do so said the young man with a quickness which gave proof of his ready invention i am as you have said the count andrea cavalcanti son of major bartolomeo cavalcanti a descendant of the cavalcanti whose names are inscribed in the golden book at florence our family although still rich for my fathers income amounts to half a million has experienced many misfortunes and i myself was at the age of five years taken away by the treachery of my tutor so that for fifteen years i have not seen the author of my existence since i have arrived at years of discretion and become my own master i have been constantly seeking him but all in vain at length i received this letter from your friend which states that my father is in paris and authorizes me to address myself to you for information respecting him really all you have related to me is exceedingly interesting said monte cristo observing the young man with a gloomy satisfaction and you have done well to conform in everything to the wishes of my friend sinbad for your father is indeed here and is seeking you the count from the moment of first entering the drawing-room had not once lost sight of the expression of the young mans countenance he had admired the assurance of his look and the firmness of his voice but at these words so natural in themselves your father is indeed here and is seeking you young andrea started and exclaimed my father is my father here most undoubtedly replied monte cristo your father major bartolomeo cavalcanti the expression of terror which for the moment had overspread the features of the young man had now disappeared ah yes that is the name certainly major bartolomeo cavalcanti and you really mean to say monsieur that my dear father is here yes sir and i can even add that i have only just left his company the history which he related to me of his lost son touched me to the quick indeed his griefs hopes and fears on that subject might furnish material for a most touching and pathetic poem at length he one day received a letter stating that the abductors of his son now offered to restore him or at least to give notice where he might be found on condition of receiving a large sum of money by way of ransom your father did not hesitate an instant and the sum was sent to the frontier of piedmont with a passport signed for italy you were in the south of france i think yes replied andrea with an embarrassed air i was in the south of france a carriage was to await you at nice precisely so and it conveyed me from nice to genoa from genoa to turin from turin to chambry from chambry to pont-de-beauvoisin and from pont-de-beauvoisin to paris m indeed then your father ought to have met with you on the road for it is exactly the same route which he himself took and that is how we have been able to trace your journey to this place but said andrea if my father had met me i doubt if he would have recognized me i must be somewhat altered since he last saw me oh the voice of nature said monte cristo true interrupted the young man i had not looked upon it in that light now replied monte cristo there is only one source of uneasiness left in your fathers mind which is this he is anxious to know how you have been employed during your long absence from him how you have been treated by your persecutors and if they have conducted themselves towards you with all the deference due to your rank finally he is anxious to see if you have been fortunate enough to escape the bad moral influence to which you have been exposed and which is infinitely more to be dreaded than any physical suffering he wishes to discover if the fine abilities with which nature had endowed you have been weakened by want of culture and in short whether you consider yourself capable of resuming and retaining in the world the high position to which your rank entitles you sir exclaimed the young man quite astounded i hope no
