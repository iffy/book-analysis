taking an ellipsis of forty feet i made it fifty i expected as i told you to reach the outer wall pierce through it and throw myself into the sea i have however kept along the corridor on which your chamber opens instead of going beneath it my labor is all in vain for i find that the corridor looks into a courtyard filled with soldiers thats true said dants but the corridor you speak of only bounds one side of my cell there are three others do you know anything of their situation this one is built against the solid rock and it would take ten experienced miners duly furnished with the requisite tools as many years to perforate it this adjoins the lower part of the governors apartments and were we to work our way through we should only get into some lock-up cellars where we must necessarily be recaptured the fourth and last side of your cell faces on faces on stop a minute now where does it face the wall of which he spoke was the one in which was fixed the loophole by which light was admitted to the chamber this loophole which gradually diminished in size as it approached the outside to an opening through which a child could not have passed was for better security furnished with three iron bars so as to quiet all apprehensions even in the mind of the most suspicious jailer as to the possibility of a prisoners escape as the stranger asked the question he dragged the table beneath the window climb up said he to dants the young man obeyed mounted on the table and divining the wishes of his companion placed his back securely against the wall and held out both hands the stranger whom as yet dants knew only by the number of his cell sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in a person of his years and light and steady on his feet as a cat or a lizard climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of dants and from them to his shoulders then bending double for the ceiling of the dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect he managed to slip his head between the upper bars of the window so as to be able to command a perfect view from top to bottom an instant afterwards he hastily drew back his head saying i thought so and sliding from the shoulders of dants as dextrously as he had ascended he nimbly leaped from the table to the ground what was it that you thought asked the young man anxiously in his turn descending from the table the elder prisoner pondered the matter yes said he at length it is so this side of your chamber looks out upon a kind of open gallery where patrols are continually passing and sentries keep watch day and night are you quite sure of that certain i saw the soldiers shape and the top of his musket that made me draw in my head so quickly for i was fearful he might also see me well inquired dants you perceive then the utter impossibility of escaping through your dungeon then pursued the young man eagerly then answered the elder prisoner the will of god be done and as the old man slowly pronounced those words an air of profound resignation spread itself over his careworn countenance dants gazed on the man who could thus philosophically resign hopes so long and ardently nourished with an astonishment mingled with admiration tell me i entreat of you who and what you are said he at length never have i met with so remarkable a person as yourself willingly answered the stranger if indeed you feel any curiosity respecting one now alas powerless to aid you in any way say not so you can console and support me by the strength of your own powerful mind pray let me know who you really are the stranger smiled a melancholy smile then listen said he i am the abb faria and have been imprisoned as you know in this chteau dif since the year previously to which i had been confined for three years in the fortress of fenestrelle in the year i was transferred to piedmont in france it was at this period i learned that the destiny which seemed subservient to every wish formed by napoleon had bestowed on him a son named king of rome even in his cradle i was very far then from expecting the change you have just informed me of namely that four years afterwards this colossus of power would be overthrown then who reigns in france at this moment napoleon ii no louis xviii the brother of louis xvi how inscrutable are the ways of providence for what great and mysterious purpose has it pleased heaven to abase the man once so elevated and raise up him who was so abased dants whole attention was riveted on a man who could thus forget his own misfortunes while occupying himself with the destinies of others yes yes continued he twill be the same as it was in england after charles i cromwell after cromwell charles ii and then james ii and then some son-in-law or relation some prince of orange a stadtholder who becomes a king then new concessions
