you must give me your word to return immediately to your hotel and make no attempt to follow this man tonight there are certain affinities between the persons we quit and those we meet afterwards for heavens sake do not serve as a conductor between that man and me pursue your chase after him tomorrow as eagerly as you please but never bring him near me if you would not see me die of terror and now good-night go to your rooms and try to sleep away all recollections of this evening for my own part i am quite sure i shall not be able to close my eyes so saying the countess quitted franz leaving him unable to decide whether she were merely amusing herself at his expense or whether her fears and agitations were genuine upon his return to the hotel franz found albert in his dressing-gown and slippers listlessly extended on a sofa smoking a cigar my dear fellow cried he springing up is it really you why i did not expect to see you before tomorrow my dear albert replied franz i am glad of this opportunity to tell you once and forever that you entertain a most erroneous notion concerning italian women i should have thought the continual failures you have met with in all your own love affairs might have taught you better by this time upon my soul these women would puzzle the very devil to read them aright why here they give you their hand they press yours in return they keep up a whispering conversation permit you to accompany them home why if a parisian were to indulge in a quarter of these marks of flattering attention her reputation would be gone forever and the very reason why the women of this fine country where sounds the si as dante writes put so little restraint on their words and actions is because they live so much in public and have really nothing to conceal besides you must have perceived that the countess was really alarmed at what at the sight of that respectable gentleman sitting opposite to us in the same box with the lovely greek girl now for my part i met them in the lobby after the conclusion of the piece and hang me if i can guess where you took your notions of the other world from i can assure you that this hobgoblin of yours is a deuced fine-looking fellow admirably dressed indeed i feel quite sure from the cut of his clothes they are made by a first-rate paris tailor probably blin or humann he was rather too pale certainly but then you know paleness is always looked upon as a strong proof of aristocratic descent and distinguished breeding franz smiled for he well remembered that albert particularly prided himself on the entire absence of color in his own complexion well that tends to confirm my own ideas said franz that the countesss suspicions were destitute alike of sense and reason did he speak in your hearing and did you catch any of his words i did but they were uttered in the romaic dialect i knew that from the mixture of greek words i dont know whether i ever told you that when i was at college i was rather rather strong in greek he spoke the romaic language did he i think so that settles it murmured franz tis he past all doubt what do you say nothing nothing but tell me what were you thinking about when i came in oh i was arranging a little surprise for you indeed of what nature why you know it is quite impossible to procure a carriage certainly and i also know that we have done all that human means afforded to endeavor to get one now then in this difficulty a bright idea has flashed across my brain franz looked at albert as though he had not much confidence in the suggestions of his imagination i tell you what m franz cried albert you deserve to be called out for such a misgiving and incredulous glance as that you were pleased to bestow on me just now and i promise to give you the satisfaction of a gentleman if your scheme turns out as ingenious as you assert well then hearken to me i listen you agree do you not that obtaining a carriage is out of the question i do neither can we procure horses true we have offered any sum but have failed well now what do you say to a cart i dare say such a thing might be had very possibly and a pair of oxen as easily found as the cart then you see my good fellow with a cart and a couple of oxen our business can be managed the cart must be tastefully ornamented and if you and i dress ourselves as neapolitan reapers we may get up a striking tableau after the manner of that splendid picture by lopold robert it would add greatly to the effect if the countess would join us in the costume of a peasant from puzzoli or sorrento our group would then be quite complete more especially as the countess is quite beautiful enough to represent a madonna well said franz this time m albert i am bound to give you credit for having
