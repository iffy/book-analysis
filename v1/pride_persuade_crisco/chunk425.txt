to spare a fathers feelings or a mothers sensibility is not to do a good action but a simple deed of humanity at these words uttered with the most exquisite sweetness and politeness madame de morcerf replied it is very fortunate for my son monsieur that he found such a friend and i thank god that things are thus and mercds raised her fine eyes to heaven with so fervent an expression of gratitude that the count fancied he saw tears in them m de morcerf approached her madame said he i have already made my excuses to the count for quitting him and i pray you to do so also the sitting commences at two it is now three and i am to speak go then and monsieur and i will strive our best to forget your absence replied the countess with the same tone of deep feeling monsieur continued she turning to monte cristo will you do us the honor of passing the rest of the day with us believe me madame i feel most grateful for your kindness but i got out of my travelling carriage at your door this morning and i am ignorant how i am installed in paris which i scarcely know this is but a trifling inquietude i know but one that may be appreciated we shall have the pleasure another time said the countess you promise that monte cristo inclined himself without answering but the gesture might pass for assent i will not detain you monsieur continued the countess i would not have our gratitude become indiscreet or importunate my dear count said albert i will endeavor to return your politeness at rome and place my coup at your disposal until your own be ready a thousand thanks for your kindness viscount returned the count of monte cristo but i suppose that m bertuccio has suitably employed the four hours and a half i have given him and that i shall find a carriage of some sort ready at the door albert was used to the counts manner of proceeding he knew that like nero he was in search of the impossible and nothing astonished him but wishing to judge with his own eyes how far the counts orders had been executed he accompanied him to the door of the house monte cristo was not deceived as soon as he appeared in the count of morcerfs antechamber a footman the same who at rome had brought the counts card to the two young men and announced his visit sprang into the vestibule and when he arrived at the door the illustrious traveller found his carriage awaiting him it was a coup of kollers building and with horses and harness for which drake had to the knowledge of all the lions of paris refused on the previous day seven hundred guineas monsieur said the count to albert i do not ask you to accompany me to my house as i can only show you a habitation fitted up in a hurry and i have as you know a reputation to keep up as regards not being taken by surprise give me therefore one more day before i invite you i shall then be certain not to fail in my hospitality if you ask me for a day count i know what to anticipate it will not be a house i shall see but a palace you have decidedly some genius at your control ma foi spread that idea replied the count of monte cristo putting his foot on the velvet-lined steps of his splendid carriage and that will be worth something to me among the ladies as he spoke he sprang into the vehicle the door was closed but not so rapidly that monte cristo failed to perceive the almost imperceptible movement which stirred the curtains of the apartment in which he had left madame de morcerf when albert returned to his mother he found her in the boudoir reclining in a large velvet armchair the whole room so obscure that only the shining spangle fastened here and there to the drapery and the angles of the gilded frames of the pictures showed with some degree of brightness in the gloom albert could not see the face of the countess as it was covered with a thin veil she had put on her head and which fell over her features in misty folds but it seemed to him as though her voice had altered he could distinguish amid the perfumes of the roses and heliotropes in the flower-stands the sharp and fragrant odor of volatile salts and he noticed in one of the chased cups on the mantle-piece the countesss smelling-bottle taken from its shagreen case and exclaimed in a tone of uneasiness as he entered my dear mother have you been ill during my absence no no albert but you know these roses tuberoses and orange-flowers throw out at first before one is used to them such violent perfumes then my dear mother said albert putting his hand to the bell they must be taken into the antechamber you are really ill and just now were so pale as you came into the room was i pale albert yes a pallor that suits you admirably mother but which did not the less alarm my father and myself did your father speak of it inquired
