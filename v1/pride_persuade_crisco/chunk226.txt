elliot and be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with and do justice to captain wentworth this however was what lady russell had now to do she must learn to feel that she had been mistaken with regard to both that she had been unfairly influenced by appearances in each that because captain wentworth's manners had not suited her own ideas she had been too quick in suspecting them to indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity and that because mr elliot's manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety and correctness their general politeness and suavity she had been too quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct opinions and well-regulated mind there was nothing less for lady russell to do than to admit that she had been pretty completely wrong and to take up a new set of opinions and of hopes there is a quickness of perception in some a nicety in the discernment of character a natural penetration in short which no experience in others can equal and lady russell had been less gifted in this part of understanding than her young friend but she was a very good woman and if her second object was to be sensible and well-judging her first was to see anne happy she loved anne better than she loved her own abilities and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over found little hardship in attaching herself as a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child of all the family mary was probably the one most immediately gratified by the circumstance it was creditable to have a sister married and she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental to the connexion by keeping anne with her in the autumn and as her own sister must be better than her husband's sisters it was very agreeable that captain wentworth should be a richer man than either captain benwick or charles hayter she had something to suffer perhaps when they came into contact again in seeing anne restored to the rights of seniority and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette but she had a future to look forward to of powerful consolation anne had no uppercross hall before her no landed estate no headship of a family and if they could but keep captain wentworth from being made a baronet she would not change situations with anne it would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied with her situation for a change is not very probable there she had soon the mortification of seeing mr elliot withdraw and no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise even the unfounded hopes which sunk with him the news of his cousin anne's engagement burst on mr elliot most unexpectedly it deranged his best plan of domestic happiness his best hope of keeping sir walter single by the watchfulness which a son-in-law's rights would have given but though discomfited and disappointed he could still do something for his own interest and his own enjoyment he soon quitted bath and on mrs clay's quitting it soon afterwards and being next heard of as established under his protection in london it was evident how double a game he had been playing and how determined he was to save himself from being cut out by one artful woman at least mrs clay's affections had overpowered her interest and she had sacrificed for the young man's sake the possibility of scheming longer for sir walter she has abilities however as well as affections and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning or hers may finally carry the day whether after preventing her from being the wife of sir walter he may not be wheedled and caressed at last into making her the wife of sir william it cannot be doubted that sir walter and elizabeth were shocked and mortified by the loss of their companion and the discovery of their deception in her they had their great cousins to be sure to resort to for comfort but they must long feel that to flatter and follow others without being flattered and followed in turn is but a state of half enjoyment anne satisfied at a very early period of lady russell's meaning to love captain wentworth as she ought had no other alloy to the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness of having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value there she felt her own inferiority very keenly the disproportion in their fortune was nothing it did not give her a moment's regret but to have no family to receive and estimate him properly nothing of respectability of harmony of good will to offer in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her in his brothers and sisters was a source of as lively pain as her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise strong felicity she had but two friends in the world to add to his list lady russell and mrs smith to those however he was very well disposed to attach himself lady russell in spite of all her former transgressions he could now value from his heart while he was not obliged to say that he believed her
