bath mr elliot repeated anne looking up surprised a moment's reflection shewed her the mistake she had been under she caught it instantaneously and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety soon added more composedly are you acquainted with mr elliot i have been a good deal acquainted with him replied mrs smith gravely but it seems worn out now it is a great while since we met i was not at all aware of this you never mentioned it before had i known it i would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you to confess the truth said mrs smith assuming her usual air of cheerfulness that is exactly the pleasure i want you to have i want you to talk about me to mr elliot i want your interest with him he can be of essential service to me and if you would have the goodness my dear miss elliot to make it an object to yourself of course it is done i should be extremely happy i hope you cannot doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you replied anne but i suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on mr elliot a greater right to influence him than is really the case i am sure you have somehow or other imbibed such a notion you must consider me only as mr elliot's relation if in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him i beg you would not hesitate to employ me mrs smith gave her a penetrating glance and then smiling said i have been a little premature i perceive i beg your pardon i ought to have waited for official information but now my dear miss elliot as an old friend do give me a hint as to when i may speak next week to be sure by next week i may be allowed to think it all settled and build my own selfish schemes on mr elliot's good fortune no replied anne nor next week nor next nor next i assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week i am not going to marry mr elliot i should like to know why you imagine i am mrs smith looked at her again looked earnestly smiled shook her head and exclaimed now how i do wish i understood you how i do wish i knew what you were at i have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel when the right moment occurs till it does come you know we women never mean to have anybody it is a thing of course among us that every man is refused till he offers but why should you be cruel let me plead for my--present friend i cannot call him but for my former friend where can you look for a more suitable match where could you expect a more gentlemanlike agreeable man let me recommend mr elliot i am sure you hear nothing but good of him from colonel wallis and who can know him better than colonel wallis my dear mrs smith mr elliot's wife has not been dead much above half a year he ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses to any one oh if these are your only objections cried mrs smith archly mr elliot is safe and i shall give myself no more trouble about him do not forget me when you are married that's all let him know me to be a friend of yours and then he will think little of the trouble required which it is very natural for him now with so many affairs and engagements of his own to avoid and get rid of as he can very natural perhaps ninety-nine out of a hundred would do the same of course he cannot be aware of the importance to me well my dear miss elliot i hope and trust you will be very happy mr elliot has sense to understand the value of such a woman your peace will not be shipwrecked as mine has been you are safe in all worldly matters and safe in his character he will not be led astray he will not be misled by others to his ruin no said anne i can readily believe all that of my cousin he seems to have a calm decided temper not at all open to dangerous impressions i consider him with great respect i have no reason from any thing that has fallen within my observation to do otherwise but i have not known him long and he is not a man i think to be known intimately soon will not this manner of speaking of him mrs smith convince you that he is nothing to me surely this must be calm enough and upon my word he is nothing to me should he ever propose to me which i have very little reason to imagine he has any thought of doing i shall not accept him i assure you i shall not i assure you mr elliot had not the share which you have been supposing in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford not mr elliot it is not mr elliot that she stopped regretting
