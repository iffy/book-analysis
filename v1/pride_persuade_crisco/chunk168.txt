into a rut nor ran foul of a dung-cart and anne with some amusement at their style of driving which she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance of their affairs found herself safely deposited by them at the cottage chapter the time now approached for lady russell's return the day was even fixed and anne being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled was looking forward to an early removal to kellynch and beginning to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it it would place her in the same village with captain wentworth within half a mile of him they would have to frequent the same church and there must be intercourse between the two families this was against her but on the other hand he spent so much of his time at uppercross that in removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him behind than as going towards him and upon the whole she believed she must on this interesting question be the gainer almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society in leaving poor mary for lady russell she wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing captain wentworth at the hall those rooms had witnessed former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of lady russell and captain wentworth never meeting anywhere they did not like each other and no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good and were lady russell to see them together she might think that he had too much self-possession and she too little these points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating her removal from uppercross where she felt she had been stationed quite long enough her usefulness to little charles would always give some sweetness to the memory of her two months visit there but he was gaining strength apace and she had nothing else to stay for the conclusion of her visit however was diversified in a way which she had not at all imagined captain wentworth after being unseen and unheard of at uppercross for two whole days appeared again among them to justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away a letter from his friend captain harville having found him out at last had brought intelligence of captain harville's being settled with his family at lyme for the winter of their being therefore quite unknowingly within twenty miles of each other captain harville had never been in good health since a severe wound which he received two years before and captain wentworth's anxiety to see him had determined him to go immediately to lyme he had been there for four-and-twenty hours his acquittal was complete his friendship warmly honoured a lively interest excited for his friend and his description of the fine country about lyme so feelingly attended to by the party that an earnest desire to see lyme themselves and a project for going thither was the consequence the young people were all wild to see lyme captain wentworth talked of going there again himself it was only seventeen miles from uppercross though november the weather was by no means bad and in short louisa who was the most eager of the eager having formed the resolution to go and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked being now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way bore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off till summer and to lyme they were to go--charles mary anne henrietta louisa and captain wentworth the first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night but to this mr musgrove for the sake of his horses would not consent and when it came to be rationally considered a day in the middle of november would not leave much time for seeing a new place after deducting seven hours as the nature of the country required for going and returning they were consequently to stay the night there and not to be expected back till the next day's dinner this was felt to be a considerable amendment and though they all met at the great house at rather an early breakfast hour and set off very punctually it was so much past noon before the two carriages mr musgrove's coach containing the four ladies and charles's curricle in which he drove captain wentworth were descending the long hill into lyme and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself that it was very evident they would not have more than time for looking about them before the light and warmth of the day were gone after securing accommodations and ordering a dinner at one of the inns the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly down to the sea they were come too late in the year for any amusement or variety which lyme as a public place might offer the rooms were shut up the lodgers almost all gone scarcely any family but of the residents left and as there is nothing to admire in the buildings themselves the remarkable situation of the town the principal street almost
