and it was evident there was a great demand for a repetition carmela alone objecting to it but the count of san-felice besought his daughter so earnestly that she acceded one of the cavaliers then hastened to invite teresa without whom it was impossible for the quadrille to be formed but the young girl had disappeared the truth was that luigi had not felt the strength to support another such trial and half by persuasion and half by force he had removed teresa toward another part of the garden teresa had yielded in spite of herself but when she looked at the agitated countenance of the young man she understood by his silence and trembling voice that something strange was passing within him she herself was not exempt from internal emotion and without having done anything wrong yet fully comprehended that luigi was right in reproaching her why she did not know but yet she did not the less feel that these reproaches were merited however to teresas great astonishment luigi remained mute and not a word escaped his lips the rest of the evening when the chill of the night had driven away the guests from the gardens and the gates of the villa were closed on them for the festa in-doors he took teresa quite away and as he left her at her home he said teresa what were you thinking of as you danced opposite the young countess of san-felice i thought replied the young girl with all the frankness of her nature that i would give half my life for a costume such as she wore and what said your cavalier to you he said it only depended on myself to have it and i had only one word to say he was right said luigi do you desire it as ardently as you say yes well then you shall have it the young girl much astonished raised her head to look at him but his face was so gloomy and terrible that her words froze to her lips as luigi spoke thus he left her teresa followed him with her eyes into the darkness as long as she could and when he had quite disappeared she went into the house with a sigh m that night a memorable event occurred due no doubt to the imprudence of some servant who had neglected to extinguish the lights the villa of san-felice took fire in the rooms adjoining the very apartment of the lovely carmela awakened in the night by the light of the flames she sprang out of bed wrapped herself in a dressing-gown and attempted to escape by the door but the corridor by which she hoped to fly was already a prey to the flames she then returned to her room calling for help as loudly as she could when suddenly her window which was twenty feet from the ground was opened a young peasant jumped into the chamber seized her in his arms and with superhuman skill and strength conveyed her to the turf of the grass-plot where she fainted when she recovered her father was by her side all the servants surrounded her offering her assistance an entire wing of the villa was burnt down but what of that as long as carmela was safe and uninjured her preserver was everywhere sought for but he did not appear he was inquired after but no one had seen him carmela was greatly troubled that she had not recognized him as the count was immensely rich excepting the danger carmela had run and the marvellous manner in which she had escaped made that appear to him rather a favor of providence than a real misfortune the loss occasioned by the conflagration was to him but a trifle the next day at the usual hour the two young peasants were on the borders of the forest luigi arrived first he came toward teresa in high spirits and seemed to have completely forgotten the events of the previous evening the young girl was very pensive but seeing luigi so cheerful she on her part assumed a smiling air which was natural to her when she was not excited or in a passion luigi took her arm beneath his own and led her to the door of the grotto then he paused the young girl perceiving that there was something extraordinary looked at him steadfastly teresa said luigi yesterday evening you told me you would give all the world to have a costume similar to that of the counts daughter yes replied teresa with astonishment but i was mad to utter such a wish and i replied very well you shall have it yes replied the young girl whose astonishment increased at every word uttered by luigi but of course your reply was only to please me i have promised no more than i have given you teresa said luigi proudly go into the grotto and dress yourself at these words he drew away the stone and showed teresa the grotto lighted up by two wax lights which burnt on each side of a splendid mirror on a rustic table made by luigi were spread out the pearl necklace and the diamond pins and on a chair at the side was laid the rest of the costume teresa uttered a cry of joy and without inquiring whence this attire
