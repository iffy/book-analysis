to leave dants where he was he found the prisoner in the same position as if fixed there his eyes swollen with weeping he had passed the night standing and without sleep the jailer advanced dants appeared not to perceive him he touched him on the shoulder edmond started have you not slept said the jailer i do not know replied dants the jailer stared are you hungry continued he i do not know do you wish for anything i wish to see the governor the jailer shrugged his shoulders and left the chamber dants followed him with his eyes and stretched forth his hands towards the open door but the door closed all his emotion then burst forth he cast himself on the ground weeping bitterly and asking himself what crime he had committed that he was thus punished the day passed thus he scarcely tasted food but walked round and round the cell like a wild beast in its cage one thought in particular tormented him namely that during his journey hither he had sat so still whereas he might a dozen times have plunged into the sea and thanks to his powers of swimming for which he was famous have gained the shore concealed himself until the arrival of a genoese or spanish vessel escaped to spain or italy where mercds and his father could have joined him he had no fears as to how he should live good seamen are welcome everywhere he spoke italian like a tuscan and spanish like a castilian he would have been free and happy with mercds and his father whereas he was now confined in the chteau dif that impregnable fortress ignorant of the future destiny of his father and mercds and all this because he had trusted to villeforts promise the thought was maddening and dants threw himself furiously down on his straw the next morning at the same hour the jailer came again well said the jailer are you more reasonable today dants made no reply come cheer up is there anything that i can do for you i wish to see the governor i have already told you it was impossible why so because it is against prison rules and prisoners must not even ask for it what is allowed then better fare if you pay for it books and leave to walk about i do not want books i am satisfied with my food and do not care to walk about but i wish to see the governor if you worry me by repeating the same thing i will not bring you any more to eat well then said edmond if you do not i shall die of hunger that is all the jailer saw by his tone he would be happy to die and as every prisoner is worth ten sous a day to his jailer he replied in a more subdued tone what you ask is impossible but if you are very well behaved you will be allowed to walk about and some day you will meet the governor and if he chooses to reply that is his affair but asked dants how long shall i have to wait ah a month six months a year it is too long a time i wish to see him at once ah said the jailer do not always brood over what is impossible or you will be mad in a fortnight you think so yes we have an instance here it was by always offering a million of francs to the governor for his liberty that an abb became mad who was in this chamber before you m how long has he left it two years was he liberated then no he was put in a dungeon listen said dants i am not an abb i am not mad perhaps i shall be but at present unfortunately i am not i will make you another offer what is that i do not offer you a million because i have it not but i will give you a hundred crowns if the first time you go to marseilles you will seek out a young girl named mercds at the catalans and give her two lines from me m if i took them and were detected i should lose my place which is worth two thousand francs a year so that i should be a great fool to run such a risk for three hundred well said dants mark this if you refuse at least to tell mercds i am here i will some day hide myself behind the door and when you enter i will dash out your brains with this stool threats cried the jailer retreating and putting himself on the defensive you are certainly going mad the abb began like you and in three days you will be like him mad enough to tie up but fortunately there are dungeons here dants whirled the stool round his head all right all right said the jailer all right since you will have it so i will send word to the governor very well returned dants dropping the stool and sitting on it as if he were in reality mad the jailer went out and returned in an instant with a corporal and four soldiers by the governors orders said he conduct the prisoner to the tier beneath to
