better as villefort observes it is a great act of folly to have left such a man between corsica where he was born and naples of which his brother-in-law is king and face to face with italy the sovereignty of which he coveted for his son unfortunately said villefort there are the treaties of and we cannot molest napoleon without breaking those compacts oh well we shall find some way out of it responded m de salvieux there wasnt any trouble over treaties when it was a question of shooting the poor duc denghien well said the marquise it seems probable that by the aid of the holy alliance we shall be rid of napoleon and we must trust to the vigilance of m de villefort to purify marseilles of his partisans the king is either a king or no king if he be acknowledged as sovereign of france he should be upheld in peace and tranquillity and this can best be effected by employing the most inflexible agents to put down every attempt at conspiracy tis the best and surest means of preventing mischief unfortunately madame answered villefort the strong arm of the law is not called upon to interfere until the evil has taken place then all he has got to do is to endeavor to repair it nay madame the law is frequently powerless to effect this all it can do is to avenge the wrong done oh m de villefort cried a beautiful young creature daughter to the comte de salvieux and the cherished friend of mademoiselle de saint-mran do try and get up some famous trial while we are at marseilles i never was in a law-court i am told it is so very amusing amusing certainly replied the young man inasmuch as instead of shedding tears as at the fictitious tale of woe produced at a theatre you behold in a law-court a case of real and genuine distress a drama of life the prisoner whom you there see pale agitated and alarmed instead of as is the case when a curtain falls on a tragedy going home to sup peacefully with his family and then retiring to rest that he may recommence his mimic woes on the morrow is removed from your sight merely to be reconducted to his prison and delivered up to the executioner i leave you to judge how far your nerves are calculated to bear you through such a scene of this however be assured that should any favorable opportunity present itself i will not fail to offer you the choice of being present for shame m de villefort said rene becoming quite pale dont you see how you are frightening us and yet you laugh what would you have tis like a duel i have already recorded sentence of death five or six times against the movers of political conspiracies and who can say how many daggers may be ready sharpened and only waiting a favorable opportunity to be buried in my heart gracious heavens m de villefort said rene becoming more and more terrified you surely are not in earnest indeed i am replied the young magistrate with a smile and in the interesting trial that young lady is anxious to witness the case would only be still more aggravated suppose for instance the prisoner as is more than probable to have served under napoleon well can you expect for an instant that one accustomed at the word of his commander to rush fearlessly on the very bayonets of his foe will scruple more to drive a stiletto into the heart of one he knows to be his personal enemy than to slaughter his fellow-creatures merely because bidden to do so by one he is bound to obey besides one requires the excitement of being hateful in the eyes of the accused in order to lash ones self into a state of sufficient vehemence and power i would not choose to see the man against whom i pleaded smile as though in mockery of my words no my pride is to see the accused pale agitated and as though beaten out of all composure by the fire of my eloquence rene uttered a smothered exclamation bravo cried one of the guests that is what i call talking to some purpose just the person we require at a time like the present said a second what a splendid business that last case of yours was my dear villefort remarked a third i mean the trial of the man for murdering his father upon my word you killed him ere the executioner had laid his hand upon him oh as for parricides and such dreadful people as that interposed rene it matters very little what is done to them but as regards poor unfortunate creatures whose only crime consists in having mixed themselves up in political intrigues why that is the very worst offence they could possibly commit for dont you see rene the king is the father of his people and he who shall plot or contrive aught against the life and safety of the parent of thirty-two millions of souls is a parricide upon a fearfully great scale i dont know anything about that replied rene but m de villefort you have promised me have you not always to show mercy to those i plead for make yourself quite
