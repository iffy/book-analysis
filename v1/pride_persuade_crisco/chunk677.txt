bed and drew over her chest which appeared whiter than snow the embroidered cambric still moist with the cold dews of delirium to which were now added those of terror you saw the person repeated the young girl yes repeated the count what you tell me is horrible sir you wish to make me believe something too dreadful what attempt to murder me in my fathers house in my room on my bed of sickness oh leave me sir you are tempting me you make me doubt the goodness of providence it is impossible it cannot be are you the first that this hand has stricken have you not seen m de saint-mran madame de saint-mran barrois all fall would not m noirtier also have fallen a victim had not the treatment he has been pursuing for the last three years neutralized the effects of the poison oh heaven said valentine is this the reason why grandpapa has made me share all his beverages during the last month and have they all tasted of a slightly bitter flavor like that of dried orange-peel oh yes yes then that explains all said monte cristo your grandfather knows then that a poisoner lives here perhaps he even suspects the person he has been fortifying you his beloved child against the fatal effects of the poison which has failed because your system was already impregnated with it but even this would have availed little against a more deadly medium of death employed four days ago which is generally but too fatal but who then is this assassin this murderer let me also ask you a question have you never seen anyone enter your room at night oh yes i have frequently seen shadows pass close to me approach and disappear but i took them for visions raised by my feverish imagination and indeed when you entered i thought i was under the influence of delirium then you do not know who it is that attempts your life m no said valentine who could desire my death you shall know it now then said monte cristo listening how do you mean said valentine looking anxiously around because you are not feverish or delirious tonight but thoroughly awake midnight is striking which is the hour murderers choose oh heavens exclaimed valentine wiping off the drops which ran down her forehead midnight struck slowly and sadly every hour seemed to strike with leaden weight upon the heart of the poor girl valentine said the count summon up all your courage still the beatings of your heart do not let a sound escape you and feign to be asleep then you will see valentine seized the counts hand i think i hear a noise she said leave me good-bye for the present replied the count walking upon tiptoe towards the library door and smiling with an expression so sad and paternal that the young girls heart was filled with gratitude before closing the door he turned around once more and said not a movement not a word let them think you asleep or perhaps you may be killed before i have the power of helping you and with this fearful injunction the count disappeared through the door which noiselessly closed after him chapter locusta valentine was alone two other clocks slower than that of saint-philippe-du-roule struck the hour of midnight from different directions and excepting the rumbling of a few carriages all was silent then valentines attention was engrossed by the clock in her room which marked the seconds she began counting them remarking that they were much slower than the beatings of her heart and still she doubted the inoffensive valentine could not imagine that anyone should desire her death why should they to what end what had she done to excite the malice of an enemy there was no fear of her falling asleep one terrible idea pressed upon her mind that someone existed in the world who had attempted to assassinate her and who was about to endeavor to do so again supposing this person wearied at the inefficacy of the poison should as monte cristo intimated have recourse to steel what if the count should have no time to run to her rescue what if her last moments were approaching and she should never again see morrel when this terrible chain of ideas presented itself valentine was nearly persuaded to ring the bell and call for help but through the door she fancied she saw the luminous eye of the count that eye which lived in her memory and the recollection overwhelmed her with so much shame that she asked herself whether any amount of gratitude could ever repay his adventurous and devoted friendship twenty minutes twenty tedious minutes passed thus then ten more and at last the clock struck the half-hour just then the sound of finger-nails slightly grating against the door of the library informed valentine that the count was still watching and recommended her to do the same at the same time on the opposite side that is towards edwards room valentine fancied that she heard the creaking of the floor she listened attentively holding her breath till she was nearly suffocated the lock turned and the door slowly opened valentine had raised herself upon her elbow and had scarcely time to throw herself down on the bed and shade her eyes
