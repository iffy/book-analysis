only think what fun not a soul knew of it but colonel and mrs forster and kitty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns and you cannot imagine how well he looked when denny and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they did not know him in the least lord how i laughed and so did mrs forster i thought i should have died and that made the men suspect something and then they soon found out what was the matter with such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes did lydia assisted by kittys hints and additions endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn elizabeth listened as little as she could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickhams name their reception at home was most kind mrs bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty and more than once during dinner did mr bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth i am glad you are come back lizzy their party in the dining-room was large for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news and various were the subjects that occupied them lady lucas was enquiring of maria after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter mrs bennet was doubly engaged on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane who sat some way below her and on the other retailing them all to the younger lucases and lydia in a voice rather louder than any other persons was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her oh mary said she i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun as we went along kitty and i drew up the blinds and pretended there was nobody in the coach and i should have gone so all the way if kitty had not been sick and when we got to the george i do think we behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have treated you too and then when we came away it was such fun i thought we never should have got into the coach i was ready to die of laughter and then we were so merry all the way home we talked and laughed so loud that anybody might have heard us ten miles off to this mary very gravely replied far be it from me my dear sister to depreciate such pleasures they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds but i confess they would have no charms for me i should infinitely prefer a book but of this answer lydia heard not a word she seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute and never attended to mary at all in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and to see how everybody went on but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers there was another reason too for her opposition she dreaded seeing mr wickham again and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible the comfort to her of the regiments approaching removal was indeed beyond expression in a fortnight they were to go and once gone she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under frequent discussion between her parents elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though often disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last chapter elizabeths impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr darcy and herself miss bennets astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings she was sorry that mr darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sisters refusal must have given him his being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she and certainly ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his disappointment indeed replied elizabeth i am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me you do not blame me however for refusing him blame you oh no but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham no i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did but you will know it when i tell you what happened the very next day
