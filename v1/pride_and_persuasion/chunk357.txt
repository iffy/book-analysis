her two elder sisters she said to elizabeth lizzy i never gave you an account of my wedding i believe you were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it are not you curious to hear how it was managed no really replied elizabeth i think there cannot be too little said on the subject la you are so strange but i must tell you how it went off we were married you know at st clements because wickhams lodgings were in that parish and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven oclock my uncle and aunt and i were to go together and the others were to meet us at the church well monday morning came and i was in such a fuss i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and then i should have gone quite distracted and there was my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon however i did not hear above one word in ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual i thought it would never be over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them if youll believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight not one party or scheme or anything
