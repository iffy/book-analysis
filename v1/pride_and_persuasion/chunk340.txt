hundred a year during my life and fifty after i am gone that is very true said elizabeth though it had not occurred to me before his debts to be discharged and something still to remain oh it must be my uncles doings generous good man i am afraid he has distressed himself a small sum could not do all this no said her father wickhams a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds i should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship ten thousand pounds heaven forbid how is half such a sum to be repaid mr bennet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continued silent till they reached the house their father then went on to the library to write and the girls walked into the breakfast-room and they are really to be married cried elizabeth as soon as they were by themselves how strange this is and for this we are to be thankful that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice oh lydia i comfort myself with thinking replied jane that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or anything like it has been advanced he has children of his own and may have more how could he spare half ten thousand pounds if he were ever able to learn what wickhams debts have been said
