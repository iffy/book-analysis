gone i am very glad you were well enough and i hope you had a pleasant party nothing remarkable one always knows beforehand what the dinner will be and who will be there and it is so very uncomfortable not having a carriage of one's own mr and mrs musgrove took me and we were so crowded they are both so very large and take up so much room and mr musgrove always sits forward so there was i crowded into the back seat with henrietta and louisa and i think it very likely that my illness to-day may be owing to it a little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on anne's side produced nearly a cure on mary's she could soon sit upright on the sofa and began to hope she might be able to leave it by dinner-time then forgetting to think of it she was at the other end of the room beautifying a nosegay then she ate her cold meat and then she was well enough to propose a little walk where shall we go said she when they were ready i suppose you will not like to call at the great house before they have been to see you i have not the smallest objection on that account replied anne i should never think of standing on such ceremony with people i know so well as mrs and the miss musgroves oh but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible they ought to feel what is due to you as my sister however we may as well go and sit with them a little while and when
