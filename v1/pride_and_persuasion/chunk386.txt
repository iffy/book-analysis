has two or three french cooks at least and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty mrs long said so too for i asked her whether you did not and what do you think she said besides ah mrs bennet we shall have her at netherfield at last she did indeed i do think mrs long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously mrs bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of bingleys behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth the party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other i hope we may often meet again elizabeth smiled lizzy you must not do so you must not suspect me it mortifies me i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any design of engaging my affection it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man you are very cruel said her sister you will not let me smile
