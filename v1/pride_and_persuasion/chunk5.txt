wished to say something very sensible but knew not how while mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to mr bingley i am sick of mr bingley cried his wife i am sorry to hear that but why did not you tell me so before if i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on him it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit we cannot escape the acquaintance now the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of mrs bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first tumult of joy was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while how good it was in you my dear mr bennet but i knew i should persuade you at last i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance well how pleased i am and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now now kitty you may cough as much as you choose said mr bennet and as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wife what an excellent father you have girls said she when the door was shut i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness or me either for that matter at our time of life it is not so pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintance every day but for your sakes we would do anything lydia my
