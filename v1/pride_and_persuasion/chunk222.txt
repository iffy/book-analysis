this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance that i hesitated not in giving of your sisters indifference he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his own to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment i cannot blame myself for having done thus much there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sisters being in town i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me it is done however and it was done for the best on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer if i have wounded your sisters feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them with respect to that
