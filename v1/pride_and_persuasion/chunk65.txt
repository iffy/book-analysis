bingley but good lord how unlucky there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day lydia my love ring the bell i must speak to hill this moment it is not mr bingley said her husband it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life this roused a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once after amusing himself some time with their curiosity he thus explained about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring early attention it is from my cousin mr collins who when i am dead may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases oh my dear cried his wife i cannot bear to hear that mentioned pray do not talk of that odious man i do think it is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it jane and elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail they had often attempted to do it before but it was a subject on which mrs bennet was beyond the reach of reason and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about it certainly is a most iniquitous
