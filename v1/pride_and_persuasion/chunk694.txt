dress hideous the other night i used to think she had some taste in dress but i was ashamed of her at the concert something so formal and arrang in her air and she sits so upright my best love of course and mine added sir walter kindest regards and you may say that i mean to call upon her soon make a civil message but i shall only leave my card morning visits are never fair by women at her time of life who make themselves up so little if she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen but last time i called i observed the blinds were let down immediately while her father spoke there was a knock at the door who could it be anne remembering the preconcerted visits at all hours of mr elliot would have expected him but for his known engagement seven miles off after the usual period of suspense the usual sounds of approach were heard and mr and mrs charles musgrove were ushered into the room surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance but anne was really glad to see them and the others were not so sorry but that they could put on a decent air of welcome and as soon as it became clear that these their nearest relations were not arrived with any views of accommodation in that house sir walter and elizabeth were able to rise in cordiality and do the honours of it very well they were come to bath for a few days with mrs musgrove and were at the white hart so much was pretty
