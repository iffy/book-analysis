for uppercross which as you well know affords little to write about we have had a very dull christmas mr and mrs musgrove have not had one dinner party all the holidays i do not reckon the hayters as anybody the holidays however are over at last i believe no children ever had such long ones i am sure i had not the house was cleared yesterday except of the little harvilles but you will be surprised to hear they have never gone home mrs harville must be an odd mother to part with them so long i do not understand it they are not at all nice children in my opinion but mrs musgrove seems to like them quite as well if not better than her grandchildren what dreadful weather we have had it may not be felt in bath with your nice pavements but in the country it is of some consequence i have not had a creature call on me since the second week in january except charles hayter who had been calling much oftener than was welcome between ourselves i think it a great pity henrietta did not remain at lyme as long as louisa it would have kept her a little out of his way the carriage is gone to-day to bring louisa and the harvilles to-morrow we are not asked to dine with them however till the day after mrs musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey which is not very likely considering the care that will be taken of her and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to-morrow i am glad
