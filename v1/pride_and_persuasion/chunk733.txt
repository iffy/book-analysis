but i mean that i was right in submitting to her and that if i had done otherwise i should have suffered more in continuing the engagement than i did even in giving it up because i should have suffered in my conscience i have now as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature nothing to reproach myself with and if i mistake not a strong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman's portion he looked at her looked at lady russell and looking again at her replied as if in cool deliberation not yet but there are hopes of her being forgiven in time i trust to being in charity with her soon but i too have been thinking over the past and a question has suggested itself whether there may not have been one person more my enemy even than that lady my own self tell me if when i returned to england in the year eight with a few thousand pounds and was posted into the laconia if i had then written to you would you have answered my letter would you in short have renewed the engagement then would i was all her answer but the accent was decisive enough good god he cried you would it is not that i did not think of it or desire it as what could alone crown all my other success but i was proud too proud to ask again i did not understand you i shut my eyes and would not understand you or do you justice this is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one
